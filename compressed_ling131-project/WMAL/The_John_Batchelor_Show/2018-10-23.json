Republicans are good at thing\nWhat what's really happening here is that the Democratic math is often Democrats are garbage and everything basically when President Trump is the second thing in the news that has a very good thing for Republicans when he's the first thing in the news it's a problem so when Democrats spent weeks\nDemonstrating they don't care about due process and that they will railroaded by simply for political reasons\nVery good for Republicans when the lead headline is the winning twenty twenty contender for the Democrats setting herself on fire over a DNA sample that's really good for Republican when the lead headline is Democrats approaching Ted Cruz in a restaurant and screaming at him and his wife very good for Republicans the best friend up Republicans right now\nIs the insanity of the Democrats and you are seeing that full scale in the polls also obviously you're seeing it back to the very good economy on the Republican the margin by which voters trust Republicans over Democrats on the economy has never been larger in the history of the polling really say are Seventeen and the polish is amazing also\nI don't want to give credit to President Trump President Trump has done a couple of very good thing number one is taken proper economic measures that have really benefited the average American and number two the president of the United states does it make it feel like you did they change actor\nAnd usually in midterm elections there is an attempt to vote for change right now what the whole show is that Republicans are actually seen as the party of change well being the party in power it's really unusual usually the party out of power it's you know the party of change because Trump is so out of left field and so outrageous and so chaotic\nThe benefit of that is that he feels like a change agent even though he is the guy who's sitting in the state\nThat has very good for Republicans here is what the latest polls show according to the wall Street Journal voter interest in the mid term elections has searched for record within both parties helping to drive a President Trump's approval rating while maintaining the Democrats lead as a party most preferred to lead Congress according to a new Wall Street journal NBC News news poll findings point to an energized electric\nPopulated by dynamic to bring great uncertainty the outcome of an

it again [laughter]\nIs Alexandria Ocasio Cortez suggesting that I guess we're supposed to I don't know invaded Normandy to stop global warming or something here she is the most intelligent advocate for her position the left can present these days our general cause you have or test [laughter]\nWhen we talk about it at the central ... last time we had a really major existential threat to the country was around the world war two so she knows nothing about history there was an entire Cold War that existed for several decades after World War two as it turns out to the end so we've been here before and we have a blueprint and doing this before right when we bomb the Germans\n... don't don't stop her she's rolling because none of these things are new ideas what we had was an act of central Britain the context of a war we had a direct a central part with another nation this time it was not Germany an access so swiftly made the United states as an enemy as an enemy\nHistory lessons with Alexandria Ocasio Cortez or some of my favorite history lesson better directed central threat with another nation this time it was not in Germany and access\nNot act body spray okay you mean the axis powers oh that's what you mean\nAnd what we did was he chose to mobilize our entire economy industrialized our entire economy we put hundreds of thousands if not millions of people to work in

just don't understand speaking of not taking them seriously\nA very serious issue right now is cropping up on America's southern border so as folks know I'm pretty libertarian when it comes to immigration I'm somebody who believes that there should be free movement of labor not citizenship you shouldn't be able to come in the United states become a citizen and boat you shouldn't be able to get taxpayer dollars but if you want to come here at work I really don't have a huge problem with it but\nEven I libertarian on immigration believe that we ought to have actual bores in the United states indefensible boards you don't just gets across our borders because you want across our borders a country Without Borders is not actually a country this caravan issue is serious issue\nThis is according to the Associated Press this morning a girl and caravan of Honduran migrants\nShrimp or southern Mexico on Sunday heading toward the United states after making an end run around Mexican agents briefly block them at the watermelon border there seems to help at every turn for sympathetic Mexican offered food water including hundreds of locals driving pickup bans and Carlo truck stop them to let them clams\nIt's held at every turn president Mexican offered food water and clothing hundreds of locals driving pickup bands and Carlos ... stop them to let them clamber aboard that Lopez\nOn during the city of San Pedro Sula Harriet polar bears which are kept a team to add a place in the tropical heat it's the only way of her two daughters four year old Victoria and three year old Elizabeth ... beside her women let's let\nOut of economic necessity\nOr out of out of some sort of of sympathy for the folks crossing the border you cannot have a country that is the strongest economy on planet earth taking in thousands and thousands of people illegally without letting them know without any sort of skill set that does not make for good economy this is one of the reasons why it's so funny both on the left they love Norway they loved Denmark and lost when\nThe immigration restriction is have been winning in Norway Denmark and in Sweden\nYou cannot actually have it on social estate in terms of redistribution of wealth when you have an underclass that it's coming that does not have a skill set\nThat is one of one of the things about\nAbout those ... the ... the country and Scandinavian countries is it they basically banned immigration will the United states the left in the United states wants it both ways they want ... open immigration at the same time that they want to raise social sending you like never before seen in human history that is not a recipe for victory\nAnd that's why President Trump the Republicans are going to win on that even Lindsey Graham was a real job on immigration right Lindsey Graham famously one of the gang of eight along with John McCain a big fan of immigration form even he said listen this is not something we can do Nancy blows you would welcome the tournaments I don't know what happened Lindsey Graham whether\nHe bumped his head or something but Lindsey Graham to point out the ... is really good and here's Lindsey Graham senator from South Carolina saying Nancy Pelosi will welcome these caravans\nYou want to be the country of people that run you up and down the hall and spit on you or do you want to be a country of ... of of of Republicans who could actually deliver for working families out there that will foot good judges on the court that will stand up to the enemies of this country Nancy Pelosi will welcome the caravan fear\nA Donald Trump and the rest of us will stop them\nOkay well that that is exactly right and that's not at a black um some of the U.S because a country that has a rule of law must abide by that rule of law Democrat to continue to push the issue are going to lose it's funny because Democrats are so ensconced in their own bubbles and one poll shows that Democrats have far fewer Republican friends than Republicans have Democrat friends\nBecause Democrats live in areas actually she Republicans as nasty evil human beings and so they won't even talk to them they actually believe that it's a mainstream view that people should be able to flood into the country\nThey actually believe that it's a mainstream view that gender insects are completely separate and not only that that if a man calls himself a woman that that man is than a woman the latest evidence of this is I mean there's an amazing story\nIs the way the media are covering an attempt by the department of education to to find what title nine actually says so here's the headline from the New York times today it's as transgender could be defined out of existence under a Trump Administration\nNow when you read that headline what does that sound like you it sounds like the Trump Administration is saying they're no such thing as transgender people or people who suffer from\nDinner just for your gender identity disorder that's what it would sound like from that headline is that what's actually happening\nNo that's not what's actually happening because that's idiotic and nobody is saying there aren't people who are transgender\nWhat the Trump Administration is saying is that under the law laws that have to do with sex discrimination or specifically focused on biological sex they're not focused on you thinking you were a member of a different sect so when the civil rights act was written and it included language about\nMen and women in sex discrimination it did not mean that at a sex discrimination for you to say that a man who shows up in a classroom a fifth grade classroom dressed as a woman\nAnd you say that's not cool we're not going to do that that's not the same thing as a single woman can't work in the classroom that's not sex discrimination\nAnd that's that's what the Trump Administration is saying they're saying that\nBehavior by men is not the same as being female\nThat the actual what I'll read the actual article it doesn't it doesn't ban transgender people that sell what they're doing\nThe media is so dishonest with regard to how they cover transgender issues because there used to even acknowledge the fact that there is such a thing as biological sex it's orderly self defeating what does what the ... the gender insects are exactly separate but gender is sex\nRace or gender insects are completely separate you can be a man by your gender is female and that makes you a biological female that makes you an actual woman this is how they want to read the law that makes no sense under any circumstances I explain in just one second they think it's a winning issue I mean it's just it's insane it's insane\nBut first let's talk

President Trump rails the fake news this is what he's talking about this sort of headline from the New York times transgender could be to find out of existence under Trump Administration where we're just going to disappear the transgender now\nNow that is not what they're doing here is what they're doing quote\nThe Trump Administration is considering narrowly defining gender as biological immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nWell because of gender is biological and immutable and it is delivered at birth\nNot what the left is that if they've redefined the terms of the great ... areas of confusion in the transgender debate is what the hell everyone's talking about\nReally I mean that because sometimes when people in let's say gender what they mean it expressed feminine or masculine qualities and sometimes what they mean is actual sex\nAnd it is impossible to tell which unless they actually started by and then they shifted definition based on what they want their point to me that the left is really the one making the case it only to gender they're saying that if you're a feminine man you're actually a woman and if you're a masculine woman you're actually a man\nIf he wanted to find gender as just expressed characteristics of femininity or masculinity there are seven point three billion genders on planet earth which means as meaningless toward the means nothing if you want to say the gender has to do with biology\nNow you have to separate it into sex sex is based on y chromosomes in X chromosomes now they're intersects people did they very very small percentage of the population that is not the argument being made by transgender advocates they're arguing that you can be fully genetically male and female\nAll of this and make no logical sense it's completely confusing because it makes no sense there is no internal consistency or logic to the transgender civil rights movement they can't even find their term\nIf they simply want to say people should be treated well I'm with you if they want to say that I have to pretend that a man who says he has a woman is a woman that Caitlyn Jenner is just as much of a woman as my wife gave me a freaking break and every one with half a brain on planet earth knows that\nBut there is what the New York times that\nA series of decisions by the Obama administration loosened the legal concept of gender in federal programs including an education and healthcare recognizing gender largely as an individual's choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth first of all sects assigned at birth the dumbest term in the world the only the gender assigned at birth at least now you're being consistent with the terminology but\nEven that certain you can see the terminology shifting right there's gender and then there's sex assigned at birth you don't assigned a sex at birth babies are born they are what they are when my girl was born she was a girl I didn't know signed her girl\nYou know was signed her girl genetics God that was sort of baked in you know I Know 'cause she's a girl my God people and the same thing with my son when he was born you know I knew he was a boy\nI looked at him wow this was difficult and it turns out he is in fact the boy amazing coincidence they comes out and he has all male characteristics and he's also a boy\nUnreal just amazing\nAlmost scientific ooh okay so here's what they say the policy prompted bites over bathrooms dormitory single sex programs and other arenas or gender was once seen as a simple concept conservatives especially evangelical Christians were incensed I Love the New York times conservatives especially evangelical Christians were and since this is a way of splintering religious people as they get\nPaid not people who actually use their brain and recognize that there are men and women and these are two separate categories\nAnd that maybe they're women's groups that one I mean women's groups and not have men who believe that women in those groups and the same thing for women's groups\nThe same thing for bathrooms no it must be that there is those crazy people believe in Jesus it's those people the people if it weren't for those crazies believing the Jesus then it would then everything would be fine that we can all acknowledge the men and women are exactly the same except for a little bit of appendage and blow\nThe here's the New York times has now so here's the bad stuff okay what's the bad thing the Trump Administration that\nNow the department of health and Human Services is spearheading an effort to establish a legal definition of sex under title mine the federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education programs that will receive government financial assistance according to a memo obtained by the New York times\nThe department argues and it's a memo that keen government agencies needed to adopt and explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined on a biological basis but it's clear grounded in science objective and in ...\nHe's needed to adopt and explicit and uniform definition of gender as determined on a biological basis and it's clear grounded in science objective and administrative all\nAges he's proposed definition would define second he's a male or female and changeable and determined by the generals or person in Portland according to the rapper ... by the time a dispute about one sex would have to be clarified using genetic testing\nHow in the world that not just basic rationality and claim your woman I should be able to objectively tell whether you are women or not it shouldn't be up to ... it can get you to decide\nThis is what the graph shows why because marriage is a very good institution and it turns out that when you reserve yourself for marriage and you make that special and connected to a level of emotional and spiritual intimacy are likely to lead happier life I speak as someone who has led this life\nAnd the promise of the sexual revolution that phrase sex all around it's going to make everyone happy or a bunch of crap is not true it has never been true in a false promise attached herself to one human being and recognized the fact is more than just getting a rocks all you'll leave a leader happened by the way your sex life will be happier to\nAll of this should have been obvious that we as a civilization and just had decided to discard the obvious in favor of the attractive and that of course is a huge mistake but we'll be back here tomorrow with all the\nLatest the crisis on the border continues and we'll bring you follow the news

Chula\nOrganizers says CNN plan for them to begin moving north reaching the northern city of ... which is about twenty miles north and resting there the president has been responding with tweets\nThese last days certainly the president of the United states has made it very clear that he wants to make this he is making this a partisan issue saying the Democrats want this the Democrats are behind this and other remarks pointing to the Democrats\nHe's also the president and his aides at the White House are saying that there are unknown middle Easterners and the care of that\nJohn I Begin with you this caravan looks like a problem for the Democrats and I want to look at the Senate races\nArizona which is that to be close Texas not close but certainly Beto O'Rourke is a premier candidates for the Democrats Montana close Nevada close Missouri I Can't tell Tennessee I Can't tell but certainly leaning Republican\nDoes the caravan change any of those states for the Senate and does it change the house seats that are at risk and those states job\nWhat looks an awful visual because I'm Democrats are almost paralyzed and commenting on this because you know there's a fear of brown faces and even black faces and the care of him and to go criticize it and say that we have to protect our sovereignty is too risky politically correctness\nTop Trump and the Republicans I can guarantee\nCriticize it and say that we have to protect our sovereignty is to risk political correctness\nTop Trump and the Republicans I can guarantee you're going to have commercials for the last few days with the campaign which will\nFeature quotes from all the leading Democrat starting with Kamala Harris California was before and saying we have to abolish ice the immigration service and then they will be the pictures of the hordes coming a I sat next to someone at dinner who was from Hungary very knowledgeable of Hungarian politics during the migrant crisis of twenty Fifteen\nHungary was able to stop Ninety nine percent of its immigration problems for the fence\nA and he said I Believe that this could do to the Democrats this fall with the migrant issue did Angela Merkel which is painter as powerless and unwilling to defend the sovereignty of her country\nDavid Guatemalan President Jimmy Morales said earlier this month we have arrested almost one hundred people highly linked to terrorist groups specifically ISIS\nI don't know the facts in Guatemala but the suggestion is that the White House is linking this to ISIS a does this change the face of the election in the Senate as you measure it David [noise]\nI don't think so but that's only because I think the Senate is already in a really good spot for Republicans now I I Do think it's possible this message could have an impact in Arizona and Nevada um most of all possibly Montana\nTexas a secure I think Tennessee isn't a good spot um and I think just Republicans in the Senate and general are are in good shape\nThey're only competitive house each really that can be swayed either way it's among the states in Nevada but I Do think it's smart messaging by the president I Will look at your base another reason to turn out gives them another reason to get ... about the opposition party\nAnd in the mid term when you hold the White House we hold all balance of power what you want to do is try and convince your voters little they don't show up bad things are going to happen and that's really easy to do\nWhen you have no power as bad things from your point of view are already happening to your show up to vote to put a stop to that and that's the president's doing with this message ... you know the one counter here\nIs republic is Democrats are not playing ball they're not engaging here a Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer issued a joint statement after that Trump tweet where he said Chuck and Nancy call me so we can talk border security and they just turned it around to health care which is where they want things to be a but but the other thing\nThat I give Democrats have going for them in this regard as President Trump is in control of national security and he had that his disposal the power to stop migrants at the border and so it's not a situation I think this would be more potent like\nNational security wasn't twenty fourteen when Senate Republicans and in fact House Republicans were able to run against President Obama's handling of ISIS when he referred to them as the JV squad and diminished the danger that they posed the middle east and to American national security in general this is a case where\nA President Trump who's warning of this while I think it's a\nGood election year message down the stretch alternately\nHe's in charge which means he can implement policy to stop this and that's if Democrats really getting the division they can say look yeah President Trump has the power to deal with is we're not standing in his way\nThat is [laughter] don't they have some type of obligation at least in terms of messaging on this I mean\nI don't know who's behind this march I just see a bunch of people coming to the United states for a long time for the mid term don't the immigrants at least have to say something on this will be the 'cause Jon talked about David what can they say about this David I\nDon't really think they have to say anything about this and in fact I think at the same way I think it's smart for the president's push this from a political standpoint I think the best thing Democrats could do is say nothing\nYou don't anger your base by ... by by trying to outflank Trump on the right and you don't play Trump's game by looking weak and looking as though you hope that everybody\nShows up and and and gets into the country say nothing that most I Would say if I were a democratic candidate is it I was a I clearly and for border security and this is President Trump's job deal with this because he's the president and and that's what I think they should there John\nI think that's a good strategy except that there's so many than the Democrats who\nEarlier said that it's time to abolish ice so if they remain silent\n'em and they don't repudiate their previous position or they tried to model it I think that just gives it turns to debate away from health care which is what the Democrats wanted it to be in terms of immigration\nWhich is of mixed issue for Trump but not in the districts are Republicans after hold on that is a base turnout model\nCan we agree John that this is a this is about as hot as it gets as we watch these videos that we don't know what's going to happen the next two weeks but they're marching marching marching\nIt's hot as it gets as we watch these videos that we don't know what's going

um\nYeah so that these documents were filed a late night friday and it's in a case involving a lawsuit for some of these Carter Page fights it documents that have ... you know that we can chase him quite a while now and a kind of sucked into a hundred and fifty plus page a record revelation\nNot entirely surprising but hopes filling a few of the ... what were what this whole investigation that the FBI used multiple confidential human sources while\nIt was compiling information on Carter Page and the Trump campaign and all these things so that the new revelation there's we already knew about Christopher Steele the British spy who wrote the dossier to equate accused chomping the campaign of all these things\nI'm so this new document or refers to multiple uh you know plural or informants that were used and so you and I talk quite a bit about stuff on our the University of Cambridge professor who has been revealed to also be an informant\nWho met with page and George Papadopoulos one and uh so now we have those two known informants\nPlus others and so the question that you and I and everyone else would like to find out who are these informants when did they crucially when did they start ah their work on behalf of the FBI and how much were they paid and all of those close touch question\nHere's the quote from Mr hardy the FBI is protected information that would identify the identities of other confidential sources who provided information or intelligence to the FBI as well as quote information provided by those sources\nSo we have a long list to investigate we know steal we know how her\nOr the FBI has never acknowledged ... correct Chuck that's that's we've surmise and other reporters have confirmed the surmise that help ... one of them\nBut we don't know does this includes down or do we know Alexander down or he's certainly in the position to have cooperated with the FBI certainly had a large motive\nBecause after all he was identified with the Clinton campaign and we know now that the Clinton campaign one of its lawyers ... for ... coy was connecting with the FBI so do we believe down his name is in this filing\nYeah very well could be a ... that's an

a just a you know one or two interviews since his name's surfaced last December\nBut it's connected to Papadopoulos bomb and he's not saying a whole lot he's not a ... he he was obviously and the Australian government were funneling information back to the FBI and the question would be to the FBI considered him a confident ... chest and their parlance confidence for human source\nWas he nearly you know just a offered this one off tip 'em and so it's very possible that down or is considered one of their confidence with human sources\nUm there are others that you know or who have been involved in the ... who make contact with Carter Page and George Papadopoulos in these guys I'm throughout the campaign who who very well could of sharing information with the FBI\nUm and and as I mentioned you know someone a according to these documents someone was paid for their work and so that raises you\nKnow we we can assume that perhaps downer since he was an Australian Government official perhaps was not paid for that work so they're all in addition to doubt or others out there\nAnd so it'd be very interesting to find out what information they provide it but also with the whole Carter Page ... and and this new finally did not get into it but you and I've also discussed how um Republicans on on the hill of referred\nTo potentially exculpatory evidence contained in the fourth and final five so uh the somehow a pain to a different picture of the information regarding Carter Page and so I'm going to go back to Rod Rosenstein who's going to be speaking\nTo Capitol Hill I'm On Wednesday I Believe um he he signed this particular five says\nSo this is the question that you know hopefully it'll be asked to we we can expect him to try to dodge that question um as far as what type of exculpatory information there might be\nBut it's a bit next to piece that that would help put all together and it's also one of the aspects that the President Trump has been interested in declassify from these documents\nRight and it's been a rose in saying stop that de classification President Trump wanted the foresight to war and he wanted the FBI question and answer the thrill to slip Bruce or\nWho was in ... remains a D O D J principal and who was involved in communicating with Mr Steele to the FBI another he was a go between\nHis wife Nelly are worked for Glenn Simpson of fusion GPS who has now taken the fifth I think we should note that Carter that\nCarter Page needs to the other quarter page investigation doesn't happen without Glenn Simpson and Glenn Simpsons no longer cooperating with anybody\nSo a chalk we've moved the story a little bit also in the White House request for release was the word the text messages of many of these players including Rod Rosenstein\nHimself so there's an enormous amount of information that we have not seen yet and the FBI is being coy\nAbout what it will or will not release protecting confidential sources Papadopoulos is testifying this week to Congress is that accurate Chuck\nBut yet he's testifying on Thursday to the to the task force or the same task force that his interview James Baker the FBI lawyer smelly or and ah Bruce or\nUm House Judiciary and House Oversight and Government Reform committee interviewing Papadopoulos and um if you follow Papadopoulos on Twitter\nUm he's made quite a few comments recently about a lot of these what he says they're suspicious contacts that he had while on the campaign and we've documented I've documented you and I've talked about ... who is definitely\nA suspicious or contract he was an FBI informant or George Papadopoulos has said that he had at least three or four more strange contacts people coming up to him and blind to meet with him while he was on the campaign um and he now believes since he's been through you know uh\nHe's a bit interaction with helper they now believe that perhaps other informants are there are people working on behalf of western intelligence to were sent to approach him to perhaps Glenn information from it\nDoes he think ... does he think ... was one of those ... one of those FBI informants\n... yeah yeah he does um he he believes and he's not laid out\nI'll be honest he's not laid out a clear and articulate kind of ah there's no evidence yet tying sued to down or to help or um no not one clear narrative here um but they these are three or four\nVery interesting um approaches that he he you know he had um and so his theory seems to be that there's some sort of connection near\nUm because you know as as he claims he and he he he pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI but he's not found you know he was not charged with anything beyond the lowest one thousand one charge for lying um he's not been accused of conspiracy so um and and what we've heard from several lawmakers is\nThe lowest one thousand one charge for line um he's not been accused of conspiracy so um and what we've heard from several law as well as that soon after the investigation was open based upon information about Papadopoulos but down or information um there was some piece of\nEvidence that the governor receive potentially exculpatory evidence which kind of undercooked initial narratives are that the government had to to open an investigation based on ...\nSo um he he wants to talk to Congress about all of that\nWe don't know yet exactly what their mission provide 'em but you know December ... for it could potentially change\nA store here give us some new leads to follow up\nOn Chuck Ross for the Daily Caller waiting for Rosen stayed in Papadopoulos I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nInvolving you know potentially contacts between a wiki lakes\nAnd Roger Stone who was a a a friend and associate of the presidents but not somebody who formerly had a role in the president's campaign so there are still odds and ends there that are clearly being looked at\nUtah rich Lowry that Muller is not Bob Woodward thank heaven however what I take from that remark is that we're not going to get a narrative that satisfies a TV what we're going to get is either\nNo indictment or indictments we've had some indictments of Russians cheaply and also Manafort for actions that took place before the campaign\nYou believe it's significant however\nThat the sentencing for Michael Flynn has to come on December Eighteenth explain why that tells us that Mueller is going to be disappointing\nYeah let's let's ... I guess we should sort out two separate things John I think with respect to General Flynn when he\nPled guilty it was with the understanding that he was going to cooperate with the investigation and so far as we know he has made himself available for interviews questioning and all like um [noise] generally speaking prosecutors\nWhen they have an ability to influence when a sentencing is scheduled\nDo not allow cooperate or to be sentenced by the court until after their cooperation has concluded which usually means any testimony that they're\nGoing to give are expected to given the investigation or because you want the full breath of the person's cooperation to be before the sentencing corps so I think the fact that General Flynn\nIs now scheduled to be sentenced and apparently the sentencing is going to go forward on December right team indicates that Mahler doesn't think he's going to require him for any in court testimony that's not a sure sign of that but it's a pretty good sign a so that is another thing that leads me to think that the investigation is probably\nWinding down to a conclusion as far as the Woodward comparison is concerned might might point to in in my discussion with rich and I appreciate\nYour mention of vote the McCarthy report podcast um [noise] the point of that discussion was that\nModel or works for the Justice Department as a prosecutor he is not the lawyer for a congressional impeachment committee and prosecutors only real job to report is whether to recommend bringing charges or not or declining charges\nOn a particular investigation\nAnd a particular set of facts that he's been authorized to investigate so to my mind it's not ... job to do a ... on the fitness of the president to be president the question is whether there's enough evidence to to bring charges based on the things that he's been authorized to investigate\nThaddeus [laughter] and you mentioned in the past how this we're gonna be a surprise from as heroes and staying there trying to continue\nStress that this was all necessary but she also made the point and breathing last article was well there are a lot of this stuff for the special counsel's during has been handed off to other departments existing departments adjuster\nAnd really are yet to show why this was necessary which is still trying to remember that\nI Do agree with that I think that you know we question that he is whether this investigation was necessary because it was not assigned in compliance with the regulations of the Justice Department which require both showing that there's a\nConflict of interest that makes it impossible for the Justice Department to investigate the matter and the normal course and that there's a factual basis for believing that some\nA criminal charge may be appropriate because some crime has been committed um there was never any showing that there was this kind of conflict of interest and there was never any articulation\nBeen committed um there was never any showing that there was this kind of conflict of interest and there was never any articulation of the factual basis for a criminal investigation and the fact I think that\nThe portions of the investigation like the to Russia indictments ... return\nHave been transition took components of the Justice Department is strongly indicative of the fact that there was never any\nConflict of interest in the first place I don't think those cases should have been brought\nBecause I think that the the charging instruments there are more in the nature of a publicity\nUh announcements then real charges nobody ever thought\nThat a including Mahler I'm sure that a lot of ... was going to allow his awkward has to be brought to America for a trial so brain indictment like that was was pointless in that sense but the fact that it's been transition to to go and they've been transitions\nTwo components of the Justice Department indicates that there's no reason the Justice Department couldn't have done this investigation the first place\n[noise] we're speaking with Andrew McCarthy of the national Review Online and all of the McCarthy report his his very careful pod cast with rich Lowry on the events of chiefly Russia gate but there are other matters and Thaddeus McCotter W.
