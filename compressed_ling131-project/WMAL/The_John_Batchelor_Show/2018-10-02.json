certain you know they they were the Lucian areas of love this from you know the French Revolution at least but they they always depended on mobs to follow their charismatic leaders and they're angry

and why they make me so suspicious one of the great moments in the hearings Lindsey Graham going off on his fellow senators Lindsey Graham being ... actual Spartacus fought it can sort of ... I'm I'm Lindsey Graham here's Lindsey Graham\nAssistant most unethical sham now since I've been in politics and if you really wanted to know the truth you sure as hell wouldn't have done what you've done to this guy\nAre you a gang rape that no I cannot imagine what you and your family but going through\nBoy y'all power God I Hope you never get it out the American people can see the sham that you knew about it and you held that he had no intention of protecting gotten for nine\nShe's as much if a victim as you are God I hate to say a tough days and then my friends but let me tell you when it comes to this [noise]\nYou're looking for a fair process you came to the wrong town at the wrong time my friend\nDo you consider this a job interview\nThe advice and consent role is like a job just consider that she'd been through a job interview [laughter] [noise] I've been through a process of advice and consent under the constitution would you say you've been through hell\nI I've been through a hell and then some\nOkay so now then by the way all now what they say it was a wink tissue rape and then you get angry angry angry so now Lindsey Graham goes on George Stephanopoulos listen to this exchange\nIt appears that the FBI will not be invest it will not be questioning those college witnesses to contradict Brett Kavanaugh's testimony about his drink now isn't that a relevant given that there clearly was drinking going on at least it's a lot of the party\nNo I think ah you're trying to betray him as a stumbling bumbling drunks gang rape is go during a high school and college was Bill Cosby six at bay I background checks over the years or whatever I uncovered this\nNow I Want you to remember who George Stephanopoulos says I'm going to get to the point of this\nHere's George Stephanopoulos from the documentary called the war the war room was built by Hillary Clinton to defend Bill Clinton from the accusations of women credible accusations that he had a salted exposed himself to an even rate\nHere is George Stephanopoulos in Nineteen Ninety two bullying reporter to tell a story about an affair the bill Clinton was having during the elections\nI guarantee you if you did it and I haven't had any like it or not they didn't ask for national people will say they believe you have people have found\nThat the I'll tell you they don't get caught in temporary hate this law and you had a little pain\nAnd anger and difficult times or something like that they got home and you know that's important I think I didn't have to have you can't get anything slaves or anything like that but you know to get it the right thing and they didn't\nGet your stuff George ...\nAnything like that the uh you know that he did the right thing and they didn't\nYourself\nGeorge Stephanopoulos working for Hillary Clinton Hillary Clinton\nWho went on Matt Lauer show to say that the women should be investigated Matt Lauer was now accused of\nAssaulting so many women one of whom and turned over share and was in the middle of taking her when she wanted and needed medical attention that's who's reporting on these stories that she was ... uh putting together and and and that's just ABC and NBC and CBS where Charlie Rose\nAnd this was always the case we would always say oh feminism they seemed to be so angry and against men and whatever [noise] um and they would say well that's not true feminism is this evidence was that they now it is now common among feminist Twitter and feminist a articles\nTo say hash tag manner trash isn't really yeah or hash tag hate man yeah these ... these are very common it's true at every level it's from the activists level it's true in the media it's run academia it's for politics and it's true and the government\nYou have all of these examples so I think the most\nBlatant one comes from the media came out from the Washington Post fairly recently from Susanna ... new tell Walters a professor of sociology and director of women's gender and sexuality studies at Northeastern University uh she had a piece out that asked why can't we ate man\nThat the headline not why not\n... by the way just in case you want to blame the editor of that piece in say was a just a lady headline she writes in the article what we have every right to hate you you've done is wrong hashtags because patriarchy is\nLong past time to play hard at fourteen feminism and to win\nWatches the Washington Post the New York times recently hired Sarah Jong the up to their editorial board Sarah Jong I Can't read ah everything that she wrote on Twitter because this is a family program by that she did say white men or bowl\nOr she said oh man it's sick how much joy I get out of being cruel to old white men ... those are some of the more polite things that she said about men goes on and on and on there was a there was an outcry from reasonable people I mean to say conservatives\nTo say are you really going to let this woman on your board they said absolutely and then Twitter which has now censoring hate speech gave her a little check mark because she is now a a big important\nPerson you know and whenever you accused him of this whenever you actually hold this stuff up to them they always say well it's not all feminists there's just this feminist here and that evidence there but that to me\nIs like a mobster saying we're not all hidden it only we only have one or two hit men but you know they control everybody you know they have these people and you know denounce them well one of them are with them\nThat's right and you say it's not all feminists it's just the public ones\nOnes yeah I Would even say it's\nJust their leaders but it's not even just their leaders leaders of feminist in all of these areas so it was a one excuse or there's a magazine I probably can't even say this on the air or a female dog magazine\nAnd a and they said that all of these things ... it's just for formative miss Sandra ...\nUh uh well it is certainly being performed but then you look at people like that Hawaii senator uh Mazie Hirono who says men need to shut up it's time for them to shut their mouths and do something good for a change\nYou know other than creating civilization other than that but [laughter] other than forming our policy\nIs when do you think she will pay any price for that with an electorate that I assume it's half now\nWell I yeah I think her poll numbers will go up because her her base I mean Hawaii is quite far to the left\nAnd so her base or these feminist men and women and these you know there there were sixteen hundred men\nWho took out an ad in the New York times full page ad\nTo say that they believe all women and they're the good ones era you know they're not the bad guys and but it goes it's all over the place even the ones who say we're just kidding a Huffington Post at a piece on this uh what women mean when we say that men are trash\nIs a quote it can actually be directly translated into masculinity is in transition and it's not moving eh thing fast enough\nAnd this is what they're really talking about this is where academia is coming into where these a senator senator run was coming in is they're saying no no it's not it's not all of masculinity it's\nToxic masculine ... so the CDC\nHas a study to toxic masculinity\nAnd ah but what they what they define it as\nIt comes from hedge demonic masculinity this was a gender theory which is that a ... has your Monica masculinity\nFrom orange W Connell formerly Robert Conley is a transgender guy who is now a a ... now a academic and he says that it's the oppressive characteristics of masculinity boys and men must assuming perform to be considered a real man\nWould like to say what defending the country and run out fires and things like that going on\nTaking care of your family I don't know\nThe old man when you have to say\nWhat defending the country and\nFires and things like that going on taking care of your family I don't know I'm ... and so that's what they're getting at and they and then as a result of all this academia all of his activism or getting these bogus statistics the CDC is saying that in America one in five women is raped\nNow come on if that were the I mean I ... or they might be studying downtown ...\n... and her Chicago but according to the national crime victimization survey that the actual number is an order of magnitude less at the most so you've got in a in a culture where you've got it where it's permeated by lies lies by the media life by politicians lives by academia\nOr you're going to get a culture that says men are trash the trouble is the reality just doesn't match up\nThose old that thought just a second this radio show is just one small corner of Ben Shapiro world if you want to hear more\nYou should head over to daily wire dot com we can catch up on any then shows you've missed or listen to me on the angel claiming show on that wall where you can hear

saying the reality is just not there\nThe reality is just not there but it does create a pretty ugly politics when I mean this is a you know this is a tension that goes back to the ancient Greeks that that we're getting a sort of\nLife's a straw to situation there were the b._b._c. ran this interview with a few mothers\nAnd the question was why his feminism affected the mother son bond a mother was interviewed she said she was furious because she gave her her little boy gender neutral toys you know dolls to play with or this or that\nBut he gravitated toward the traditionally male toys guns and army men that sort of thing and she's furious over this what is she to do\n... I mean is that a million studies about this and kids do this or that any training whatsoever yeah\nOf course they do and I got to tell you you're you're ... video discs come out of the right time because last year feminism was the Merriam Webster word of the year this is the end ah unsurprisingly so but I Can't imagine\nThat this can go on forever there's got to be a turning point here because what they're doing is is they're creating this uh this sense of panic based on lies and and slander and they're in this case obviously destroying a good man's reputation and Brett Kavanaugh how long can that persist before people of good faith and reasonable the apple and a half a\nHalf of the global population those men say a week if we can no longer tolerate this this is a vicious this is wild this is based on lies\nYou know it's funny I had friends who had two boys and they wouldn't let them play with guns so the voice of a piece of wonder bread without the center made it into a gun and shot each other Michel ... from the Michael ... thanks so much for coming on a great job and I will be listening to your show later on ... I\nI you know one of the things I've noticed about young men I work of a round a lot of people who are much younger than I Am and I've noticed that when we talk about women as which is what men talk about him and talk a lot about one that\nSay the same things and we noticed that women have the same traits we can see them with our eyes and experience and in life\nBut the younger men are angry about it as a matter of angry about the trace of women and older men tend to talk about the trace of women with great affection\nSo if you say that women for example women are more emotional than that and that is true women are more emotional than most of us older guys kind of find that charming and delight phones and it's kind of softens our lives to have a woman in our life softens our lives a little bit because it reminds us that emotions do play a part in life and we should pay attention to that\nAnd the other guys feel somehow cheated by this and of course it only took me a while to figure out that the reason is the younger guys had not been told nobody told them everybody told them men and women are the same any difference you've seen societal induced okay\nAnd so the they're angry when they shaded they've been lied to the same is true of women it used to be that women told their daughters watch out for men they have a very very powerful sex drive they lose their heads they do stupid stuff there's sometimes cool some of them are bad guys you have to really pay attention to this\nYou know and and once you knew that he understood that when you were dealing with a good man when you were dealing with a man who didn't behave that way you know we're dealing with somebody who had a lot of restraint somebody who had been trained to respect other people to understand that women were in fact other people will get out\nDidn't behave that way when we're dealing with somebody who had a lot of restraint somebody who had been trained to respect other people to understand that women were in fact other people will get all that and I think that it's very hard it's very hard for young men when they were awash in testosterone to get that through their heads and it's very hard enough for them not to think like\nTarget you know there's a ... target female target female that's what that's everything in their body is tell him to do that\nSo girls were warned and they were told and then they learned that men most men most men are pretty good you know most men are pretty decent especially when they're sober most men are pretty decent and they they learn to respect that as well and they learn to respect immense power and they learn to respect his strength\nBut they want monopoly they want only one side to speak they weren't silence on the other side and we have let them get away with it and it really really has been a mistake they they were because of that it's because of that that they can sell this Brett Kavanaugh\nNarrative is because of that that the conversation we're always reacting to the conversation never making the conversation is The Cosby monopolize the culture and insist on monopolizing that we are always fighting a rear guard action against left wing tyranny we have to keep it up until we take over the mainstream\nThat's it for me I'll be back again tomorrow and if you'd like to hear more from me you can listen to the average claiming show it daily wire\nDot com for on high to someone over and give a listen I'm Andrew flavors silliness adventures on the bench\nW ... rich WMA a Washington shot one thousand dollar\nTime until you have A L station [noise]\nKavanaugh investigation new trade deal I'm Anne Kane Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh was questioned by police after a bar fight in Nineteen eighty five New York times reporter Ben protests Mr\nKavanaugh was hanging out with some friends that are and what appears that the police were called after a man they got into an argument which\nHad to go to the hospital because he'd been bleeding from the right here it appears that if you're having a didn't cause that and then died so but he apparently at one point it's ...

what is it that the Democrats hope to achieve by throwing this down good evening to\nGood evening John well what they want to achieve with every single aspect of their strategy with respect to Kavanaugh is delay so it\nThe more issues they can raise\nMore things that need inquiry into the more witnesses that needs to be a deposed or interviewed the more they can argue that this needs to be pushed back in time and the ultimate objective here of course is to push it back beyond\nThe mid term elections in the Democrats hope that they will take over the Senate take control of it and then be able to defeat Kevin all on the numbers\nSo the judicial temperament argument is just noise that it doesn't come does it actually exist or did they just make this up\nWell they didn't make it up I

against him is collapsing for want of any corroboration or verification these outlandish uh and and it really smearing\nA awful things that they've said about him continue to ring in the air so he

would remind us that we have temper for a reason right so the question is what is it or and if it's not for occasions like that I don't know what it's for\nThat is also plays a part and now ... seems

N. A. how on more Washington comes to talk [noise]\nI'm John ... the John ... show kind of Jerry ... the United States Navy maybe at a time that the Taliban\nAdvise seeing for example Northrop Grumman building aircraft carriers we're also looking at a paper that Jerry Rohde at his last days at the center for new American security just published about the challenges for the navy and the air force for the U.S military\nIn the Pacific especially off the shores of East Asia against an aggressive predatory state to Chinese with their Russian allies after the year twenty thirty when Xi Jinping the president for life\nTells us that he expects his military to match and a match the United States Navy their chief a threat\nTo their tyranny in the far Pacific Jerry we've spoken on the air wings and the shortfall we've spoken of the carriers even the forest for class carrier not having an answer until in the navy and the air force work together for deep strike\nBut you write if something called the fine fix finish kill chain dealing with hyper sonic weapons that can travel very quickly\nThis other element that doesn't exist now although I understand is being built and they're the Navy's debating at an unmanned platform both as a strike platform and as a tanker platform what does that mean Jerry and what what are they building\nWell what what is important here is is minimizing what we call late and see which is the time separation between when you can find a platform or find a target you want to fix its location you want to track it\nAnd then you want to be able to then targeted for elimination so if we have a a a space based asset or an overhead a intelligence surveillance reconnaissance drone\nThat is watching and it has to watch uh almost persistently to see any subtle changes in the movement of platforms are geography once it detects something that looks like a target then you want to minimize the amount of time between a classifying it as a target and then putting a weapon on that target\nThe problem is is all too often now or were either using overhead space based I uh I asked our assets or overhead I'm a unmanned platforms that are not equipped with weapons and so the idea of having a platform that can penetrate into a very advanced a surface to air missile environment\nOr that means that that platform would have to have a low aspect stealth\nA all aspects self or all the way around it and then we'll have to have a deep magazine 'cause eventually once you have that platform get in there you want it to persist in that environment for a period of time\nAh so they get hit perhaps multiple targets so or the the problem there becomes you know how long can men sit in a bomber or an aircraft and still be combat effective\nIf you're in a very large bomber like the new be Twenty one than perhaps you can do that you get up and move around a little bit of stretching legs was far naval aircraft it's very difficult to do that and you're almost limited to ten hour profiles\nSo the idea of launching an unmanned platform from a carrier and then having a platform refuel on its way to the target so that it can extend its endurance\nAnd then look for targets identified them hit them and then move on to a new set of targets that's really sort of the holy grail of this ah find fix finish a triangle that we look at\nAnd so this is where a naval aviation ought to be going with it's designed for a long range fixed wing a bomber\nBut dust far has not um in fact it it seems to be hung up on on F. thirty five an F. eighteens about which are both fine aircraft for what their original design was which was sort of a light attack mission but\nWhen you want to go deep you want to go with a heavier load and you want to be able to persist there and so the navy is falling short of that over the last generation and a half\nIs a navy fighting in the last war Jerry that is\nFor Jerry that is the curse of the twentieth century\nSo we we actually talked about this we we think that the navy gets up every morning prepares to fight the battle of midway um and so it's not just the last war it's perhaps three or so ago\nWas that great victory bad boy at seven minutes to change the course of the war\nAbsolutely absolutely and everyone you know wants to be able to go to a point luck and know the game plan to execute and the army for that sense I mean I I I think we're the U.S military sort of fixed a strategically in sort of the larger wars of the second World War without moving on to the environment we actually exist and\nAnd so looking to the future if the navy was looking to that then it would be wanting to move its carrier air wings or to a new uh a mix of aircraft\nIn order to keep them relevant into these future environments that we can see coming were missiles and directed energy and longer range weapons systems are going to dominate but that's far we have not seen that in fact we seem to be can last and in the Nineteen nineties\nWhen we could park a carrier in the ... seat and then take a Fifteen minute hop over into the former Yugoslavia um and and no one's going to shoot back at you so the idea of being locked strategically into permissive environments seems to be the mistake that we've made over the last Thirty years\nIs the carrier secure now as it as a deploys into the Pacific to act Kennedy defeat China now Jerry\nSo that that's a great question I Would say that we still maintain that advantage over the Chinese now both geostrategic police strategically at the operational level and perhaps even tactically but the Chinese are building capabilities and resources very quickly\nAnd at some point in time you can you can envision in your mind that sometime within the next ten years I Believe and the twenty twenty five to twenty thirty timeframe\nThat there will be at the marsh and um and they will call are bad and we'll have to make a decision whether we're going to lean in and come to the age of an ally or partner\nOr whether we're going to cede that portion of the ocean and that portion of the world\nTo a Chinese sphere of influence and I fear that we will not be ready for that\nChallenge and the U.S navy right now and the debates they're looking forward they're talking about a three hundred and fifty five ship navy perhaps by twenty thirty would that provide the ... of the security that the carrier means in order to penetrate the Pacific\nSo it will head in that direction because we certainly do need more platforms in order to surround our aircraft carriers and give them adequately defenses but this other part that I raised in the paper which is we need to invest in a new generation of missiles\nNew generation of radars and sensors that will allow those ships or be they cruisers destroyers or ...\nOr to better protect that carrier and its air wing as its executing mission we also need a new generation of of ... to do to the day to day presidents operations to preserve the peace\nIn the interim between now in that war and then they'll serve an escort a mission once in a war begins and and I think the navy is beginning to think about that we've set the number right three hundred and fifty five ships\nWhat we haven't set is what type of ships with in that number so that has not been decided on and I noted that the air force in this last week made the mentioned that they needed to grow from three hundred and twelve squadrons to three hundred and eighty six so they have a number\nBut again they're debate is how many squadrons of what type how many squadrons of bombers versus how many squadrons of fighters I\nWould argue they need many more bombers than fighters in their future for\nScott trap and Jerry Hendricks the United States Navy retired

even tell the foreign office which you know by by law he should have\nUm a because of his concerns he he he was he was concerned that the Americans will learn\nHum that he was intercepting American messages and to his dying day I'm In in the late Nineteen thirties or early forties he never admitted um how he originally intercept the telegraph\nIn fact he created several legends one of which was that it was because someone at Pearl ... documents\nRelating to the Swedish embassy on board the ship which carry parents' off the German ambassador back to Europe having been thrown out by the Wilson Administration hall was a creative genius however and we had we have to stay on top of Wilson because\nA page takes the documents back and has a trend crypt up has translated into code and they send it to the state department and Lansing the American secretary of state is the way on a vacation that weekend so his counselor State Department Foggy Bottom Frank poke\nTerry ... has ... has the telegram\nDecoded on coded crypt analysis on his part with the code book\nAnd he sees the document he sees the revelations\nHe doesn't get to take it too with the president of the United states until the next day Sunday at and at this point he introduces to Woodrow Wilson a a plot that it's so fantastic\nThe question is will Wilson believe it and Thomas Wilson is convinced that America must stay out of the war when he sees this telegram\nYou write that Mr pokes memoirs suggested Wilson took immediate action then he very much presents this case is the state department and the White House moving together the president moving together was Wilson reluctant Wilson has thoughts in his mind that this might be a fraud\n[noise] um [noise] well\n[noise] I mean it certainly he asked the question you know is this real can we trust this\nI'm I'm a you know he knew this was coming from the British I think I think he he he he never really believed this was a British forgery I don't think he he he thought the Brits would be so primitive to try something like that on him [noise]\nUm but the interesting thing to me was when I read about Wilson's reactions and it's it's\nDifficult to gauge because he didn't leave any more so you have to read it through you know the memoirs or the notes of other people um\nEat eat of course he he he's not very happy when you hear that um I don't think he's seriously believe that you believe the United states is is in danger of Mexican invasion and but as I said earlier and interview he was\nEven at that point still hoping that um you know he could bring about a peace between the warring parties that would be ... states\nNow when he sees the telegram of course he understands the Germans are really not interested in um in peace they're preparing for war against the United states to hit that point see this all efforts to bring about a negotiated peace and so the telegram doesn't\nDoesn't push came into the war that will be too
