Donald Trump took it upon himself to apologize to cabinet and family and a half of our nation that he's terrible pain and suffering you have been for a swim jeweler repeated the tire line that he and

lies and deception\nThey were and what happens in the cabinet family by like every notion of fairness decency and due process it like here's Charles Blow\nBut here's Charles blows perspective to me this was not just the president and party worried about and approaching blue wave and trying to take lyrical advantage of a moment to victory it was an outright and increasing amplification of a reactionary white male victimization syndrome that has consumed modern American conservatism\nFox has called at the unleashing of white male backlash\nThis is very bad by the way white males are not allowed you to find the right to do this is just evidence that they are privilege so if white males are given due process than that shows the privilege and if they're not given due process and then they get angry that also shows that there are a privilege so just like\nOther major leftist argument these days the conclusion is already assumed it's just a question of how you got there\nAccording to Charles Blow the woman accusing the white man of assault weren't the victims instead the white man was the victim well to be accurate the actual accusation is that the women accusing the white man of assault didn't have any corroborating evidence which means that you were trying to get this guy without any corroborating evidence whatsoever\nIn some people's eyes as low he was the victim of

whites is this your is a problem is discrimination against other groups twenty nine percent of young white woman agreed with them and nearly half believe efforts to increase diversity will harm white

experience what the what says is that we should give slots\nThat belongs you qualified white people do on while if I'd non white people is an actual point that the ... leaves it\nBut I don't even know how to less than argue this particular watching it doesn't make any sense if you were saying that there is a group of college admissions which too many are white and we need to replace some of those white people with non white people how does that not harm white people have to explain that one\nBut as for the notion that discrimination against whites is that serious a problem is discrimination against other groups there are two ways to read that question and I think that there's one accurate way more inaccurate way being accurate ways to say that historically and presently discrimination

by political correctness\nAccording to the Lansing and extended interviews and focus groups participants made clear they were concerned about their day to day ability to express themselves they worry that a lack of familiarity with the topic or an sinking word choice could lead to Syria social sanctions for them\nSo they're not really sure what it means but they know that they don't like the feeling of restriction at the left has created\nBut there's plenty of support for the idea that Americans are not as neatly divided by age or race as is commonly believed according to a few only twenty six percent of black Americans consider themselves liberal nearly half of Latinos argue that many people nowadays are too sensitive down Muslims are treated two and five black folks say that I'm an immigration nowadays is bad for America\nIn other words this notion that demographics is destiny which has been pushed by both sides of the political allows them certain extent is just not true\nAnd there is no shrinking white majority that is going to end negatively leads a liberal domination and there is no inevitably increasing liberal majority that is going to lead to incredible victory overtime\nPeople's minds can be changed in other words we're individuals we are not just members of groups that's really important to remember in the middle of what is a very very polarized news cycle and this is why the left has some serious problems even going forward\nNow that doesn't mean that the right can do things to alienate them the right obviously can do things to alienate folks and I would say there's a difference between being politically incorrect and being a jerk and this is where the right has to be careful\nNot everything that you say that as offensive is just you being politically incorrect sometimes you being a jerk if you use the N word that's not new being politically incorrect and did you being a jerk\nIf you say that men and women are different that as politically incorrect and you would not being a jerk what I Would recommend is that if you actually want to side with the middle of America that is tired of the standards that are being prevented by the left be polite civil and be politically incorrect say things that are factual specifically because\nActual specifically because they're factual and not merely to offend believe me you don't have to purposely offend a lot of us will be offended anyway none of it matters\nWhat will always be offended I just spoke at USC last week and assassinating there's a young black woman who got to ask a question and she said you've been accused of inciting violence and I said well you've been here the whole time have you heard anything that you think would incite violence and she thought about it for a second and she said no\nOf course not of course not the reason that folks on the left suggested I incite violence is because they disagree with me that is why well it turns out that most Americans\nRather have disagreement than a few violence to somebody who's not involved in violence and when the left equate speech and violence and then says if they're owned violence a speech all they're doing is alienating the vast majority of the American people left is now playing a game the Democratic party is playing a game speech of the right they say is violence because right when they are so bad\nAnd their own violence is speech so in the left goes in pounds on the doors of the Supreme Court and ask threatening that's just a form of speech that just the anger according to CNN but if folks on the right to say stuff that offends people that's now form of violence\nOn CNN headline news wise man is a man and woman is a woman and some\nTransgender woman grips me by the back of the neck and Britain's me bottle bodily harm those two things are equivalent me saying man as a man or woman as a woman according to the left is the equivalent of somebody grabbing me physically on national television and threatening to send me home and in an ambulance which is literally what happened the left\nIs engaged in in this really polarizing him and most Americans don't bite and\nThat's what we found out in the Trump ... and ... most Americans don't buy it and that doesn't mean that Trump's going to win from here to attorney it doesn't mean the Republicans always when Republicans are not good at this game there now and again when you mistake political incorrect less for being a jerk or vice versa you were making a rather large mistake yourself\nBut it is important to note that this notion on the left at the woke majority is just all the black people and all the women and everybody else it's just not true statistically and that's a very very important thing to keep in mind we still have more in common than than not\nAnd you can be fooled by watching our politics are watching social media I get bull too\nBut it's not reality okay speaking of folks were not living in reality there is a leaked report from Google was leads to Breitbart and it's just an amazing report\nBreitbart reports and internal company breathing produced by Google and leaked exclusively to Breitbart News argues the variety of factors including the election of President Trump the American tradition of free speech on the Internet is no longer viable this goes to a Jack o them saying folks on the left have decided that if their speech they don't like is equivalent to violence and\nTo suggest that the choice doesn't have ramifications or that it's easy it's misread the nature of global

hundred meters inside Israel and violating Israeli territory and it very clear will come up was trying to do to deliver\nVery inside as well and to try to evade our defenses but then as we have done fourteen times in the past in the last eight months we were able to detect it and destroy it aren't we destroyed the on the ground\nAnd the important part was perhaps that we saw the fifth time ... tried to use different feeding techniques and a few other things\nPerhaps in order to try to evade our counter tunnel efforts eh but that wasn't successful for them and we are how could they say that yet another attempt\nTo come up and quite a lot of money spent by Hamas by the way in his effort\nWas it was for but it's very nice of events around the strip or say\nWhat are you in Iraq Today

hundreds of meters away from the fence and for us it's very clear what what we have to do there\nAre the protestors the same each friday and are they compensated by the uh by the\nThe Hamas and others for for their thing you've shown how this is an organized effort putting civilians up front trying to draw a fire on to them trying to penetrate the the budget is it the same people is it to is it is

daily schedule and daily locations are of the of riots we've for instance note that on Mondays there was always a naval riot or naval attempts to penetrate into Israel and in the same location every Monday and every Friday\nThere all the five permanent locations where they come we definitely see they even just now established Hamas established a website where which participants in the riots claim that they're a so called benefits\nAnd it's been report that even in a you know the British media imagine that\nThat the uh I'll defendants are paid for participation\nAnd a double price if there was this a few hundred dollars and if they are killed during the riots which Hamas actively seeks to happen if there are kids and their family is given the around a thousand five hundred dollars\nHave you respond says the response in the IDF changed over time as well [noise]\nWell the rules of engagement have not changed we the the basics of the situation is that they're trying to get\nInto Israel and

without killing them and some of them have been successful some of them have the less accessible so that was on evolution there as well but the basics of the situation or they they unfortunately

Hamas rocket mass rocket attack momentarily are they building up to a crisis we just have thirty seconds\n[noise] I think they're definitely trying to maintain a crisis and not necessarily building up to ... they know that as long as they don't fire rockets\nThe international media will sing their praise and promote their cause and we've seen them fire in the past but that didn't go very well and

Washington hall ... A L\nW male diner Jordan he's back Mary Walter invents holidays are taking the\nCameo all because of as you said before there's reputation correct It's really about him\nI really do believe so that he is and I think again we have to go back\nTo that timeframe it's very easy I always find in these situations when you're looking back it's hard to put yourself and to put our listeners\nThe framework of what was going on then versus what's going on now but what was going on then if you recall is\nThe Trump Administration was trying still to get up and running it was trying to get its own appointees in place which is in large measure are still has not happened that the Justice Department but I I Want to underscore at a time when it was very difficult\nFor Trump's nominees to get confirmed and get to work in the various agencies of the executive branch because\nThere was so much resistance in opposition to Trump Rod Rosenstein was ... confirmed by a vote of Ninety four to six with overwhelming democratic support\nAnd when he wrote the call me ma'am oh he was bitterly criticized by Democrats and I believe it was the first time in his life anything like\nThat had happened and a lot of what happened in those eight days as a reaction a destroyed reaction to that criticism\nThe puzzle here and is this could all be cleared up with those contemporary notes that we're told exist the memos Baker and page and McCabe are all professionals and when they have a a meetings with the department of justice especially a man\nWho's putative Lee in charge of the department of justice because the attorney general is ... from many of these matters [noise]\nThat they would keep notes afterwards those notes are being taught by Congress Rosen sane at at the reporting in that rose insane is not passing them to Congress nor his Rosen stained appearing\nI call upon your understanding of the department of justice defying a the capital is is sustainable and they said something to that justice can jog a can to itself explain indefinitely\nI think there's one person who can decide that John and that's the president and and let me explain\nWhy I think that's so um you're quite right that if all that information were put out that is all this this written work product that whatever was a done contemporaneously to memorialize these conversations that\nWould clear up the mystery that we're discussing the problem of course is that not everybody has a motive to see that cleared up publicly there may be a number of people who do but I think there's a number of people don't and I fear that Mr Rosenstein maybe one of them\nAnd the reason that that is significant\nIs that if he's left to his own devices\nAre in terms of whether this ever gets disclose or not what I assumed he would be saying is that because these are discussions between him\nHimself that is the deputy attorney general and the chief counsel to the FBI and someone like Lisa Page was also an an attorney for the FBI the only person that can break that log log jam or is the president because these these of\nExecutive privilege is belong to him\nOr to the extent as any attorney client privilege here uh I I I doubt there is but to the extent there is it belongs to the president if there's any executive privilege it belongs in President if there's any deliberative process privilege which is also a a component of executive privilege it belongs to the president\nSo I think until the president decides to waive all that and say put the information out I Would think that Rosenstein would it be taking the position that these are things that can be withheld and don't need to be disclosed to Congress\nThaddeus [laughter] Andy mirror ... these accusations about him are true or not an American you're right out of groundwork partner and made beer and throw it in the car and why are they coming out now [noise]\nThink Thaddeus because Baker\nAgreed to give a interview to the committee\nI as you know in the Trump in the Trump or news cycle everything so jumps together that I Can't remember now at this point if that was two weeks ago or one week ago but I Believe it's probably a function of the fact that as we've heard and we haven't\nBut as we heard and we haven't seen\nTranscripts or anything but as we've heard Lisa Page testified some weeks back and according to people from the committee who talk and I should say should underscore here they didn't leak her testimony but they did make an observation that she was a very she seemed to be forthcoming in cooperative we have\nAnswered all the questions as the quote Andy answered all the ...\nRight I ... sometimes of course John answering all the questions doesn't necessarily mean that somebody's being cooperative but my understanding of the way that was a describes of of this pages testimony\nOr is that that was the case that she answered all the questions in a good safe way where she was trying to see if we ever get to see the interview notes the transcript and then Baker who I should underscore here\nUm has a very fine\nReputation in terms of a a ... is um integrity and in sports right now is um you can disagree with judgment calls but uh uh you know in terms of calling a spade a spade my understanding is that Baker\nHas always been pretty upright or he gave\nA uh he gave an interview to

it's\nYou know they they came up would be for I don't even know what the stands for China to they have to it or rations now and I think it has to do with them trying to hide the fact that had
