might be happening a little bit later in the show we'll try to avoid it as best we can Nikki Haley made that announcement in the White House with President Trump today it was a shock announcement here's what she had to say\nOn it is then and honor and all I I you know I said\n[noise] leave they can't raise and\nYou know Nikki Haley was indeed a bad asking her job as the UN ambassador she basically spent every day going and yelling a despot which was great at it I mean she would go in and she would talk about\nHow the United states was exceptional and America was unique place in our allies like Israel rich supporting and how the UN was basically the most ... of the international institutional\nSort of lay out and she was exactly correct about all those things I Will miss Nikki Haley greatly she explains some of the things that she got done as UN ambassador\nKind of want to\nWith the United states on foreign policy [noise]\nSaid\nThat if we say we're going to do something we fall when the price for that whether it was the chemical weapons\nIn Syria whether NATO\nSaying that on our country have to pay their share of whether the amazing they yeah [noise]\nOkay do their button bunch of rumors about what's going to happen next people suggesting that Nikki Haley is going to take Senator Lindsey Graham spot Lindsey Graham is going to become the the UN ambassador that's not going to happen I'm just going to say that right here right now Lindsey Graham has no interest in giving up a tendency to go to the UN ambassador\nWould be a great solution it'd be really Machiavellian to move her into the Senate where she could just do battle with Kamala Harris on a daily basis it would be spectacular I Would enjoy watching it and Lindsey Graham would actually make a terrific UN ambassador because it would be full time Lindsey Graham to point out that's all that he would do all day long it would be Lindsey Graham to point out and just yell at people would you be\nAmazing but unfortunately I don't think that's going to happen there are some rumors and maybe it'll be Dina Powell who was a former member of the administration or or maybe it'll be ... who would be terrific he's our current ambassador to Germany I really doubt that they are going to call them back from Germany to make you an ambassador\nThere are few other possibilities Nikki Haley is is not going to stay with the administration or she is out she is not going back to the Senate\nMy guess is that she is going to go back into politics maybe a couple of years from now but I get the sense from her from from folks you know her that she actually does just want to take some time out that you sort of been burned out on this job and I hear I mean that's that's a pretty brutal job and I met with ambassador Haley just a few months back\nAnd all of this is to say that these estimates are are wildly overstated in terms of the amount of damage that they are likely to do the reason that I say that it's because of the report itself\nThe way that these these things get report in the media is that there is virtual certainty in the scientific community at this stuff is going to happen the problem is that virtual scientific consensus doesn't actually exist a lot of key issues coming up there is another point that folks aren't really making about this IPC\nReports it's a little bit of

about how we're all going to die thanks to global warming millions will be flooded out of their homes people starving in the streets catastrophe Mad Max type stuff\nYeah it's not really true any PCC report even it's most brutal statements and how bad things are going to be they seem kind of unsure about whether that stuff's actually going to happen or not\nHere's here's what you need to do that yeah PCC cars he ... he makes two types of protections in this report the first type of protection that two degrees of global warming will be worse than won't play five degrees and global warming Celsius\nOkay and they say that with high confidence then they get to the actual specific production and would do is virtually every specific production they make about the amount of damage that is going to be done to them\nSounds of damage that's going to be done to the world climate based on one point five degrees Celsius of change virtually all of their protections\nAre couch in terms of medium confidence medium confidence means a fifty fifty shot so basically flip a coin as to whether they are right or wrong on this and then you're going to determine whether we ought to destroy capitalism on the basis of that so for example\nIn the in the first chapter well in the summary rather than the summary of finding for the Iraqis you report it says I'm the one hundred and five thousand species studied six percent of insects eight percent of plants four percent of vertebrates are projected to lose over half their climatic leap determine geographic range for global warming up one point five degrees Celsius\nCompared with an Eighteen percent of insect sixteen percent the plant and eight percent the vertebrates for global warming of two degrees Celsius\nSo basically everything is going to double\nEverything's going to double or in for insects is going to triple everything beds and the double and then for insects triple with two degrees Celsius of change versus one point five degrees Celsius and change but that is expressive medium constant confidence\nAre you willing to bet the future of the world economy and leave billions of people in poverty\nNow you're taking a virtual certainty that hundreds of millions of people live in poverty and increased conditions poverty and you're betting that against the fifty fifty possibility that some bugs will have less space to live now that's a serious consideration but I think that there is also the possibility that\nNumber one the science as a wrong number two there was a possibility that technology tends to\nActually manifest itself in different ways that when you see serious economic serious environmental problems technology is a good way of mitigating against that in fact there's the case you made the global warming because of the greenhouse effect has acted like a greenhouse\nYou seen as an increased screening in certain parts of the globe specifically because of global warming\nAnd that's sort of repeated thing inside PCs you report the more specific they get the lower their confidence level so for example they say about approximately four percent of the global terrestrial land area is projected to undergo a transformation of ecosystems from one side to another at one degree Celsius global warming compared to Thirteen percent\nTwo ... two degrees Celsius of global warming so if it's ... degrees Celsius will boring Thirteen percent of the entire global terrestrial land area is going to be transformed in terms of ecosystem but again they said that with medium confidence so they say with full confidence is it two degrees is where some of them point five degrees but they say with medium conference conference meeting half half\nIs that this change will be really really dramatic\nMy dad that's basically the case that they're making now when I say all this folks on the left me at least they well you're a climate change deniers again\nI'm not denying climate changes taking place I'm asking what the actual impact of climate change will be and to what measures will be necessary in order to curb said climate change\nSo I Want to take another story that's in the news today because it's sort of astonishing it's sort of astonishing ... yesterday guy won the Nobel Prize in economics and then as William North house she works over you\nLess champion this guy William ... has for years been modeling what sort of economic systems would be best in terms of carbon global warming and this has been his actual life were selected oh look at that that's a slap against Trump it's a slap against the right finally we're rewarding someone an economic she takes global warming seriously\nAnd good luck with all of that good luck with all of that\nThis seems frankly like an attempt to avoid\nThe ... to avoid the reality which is that we have to make economic decisions based on possibilities and probabilities that you don't get to destroy capitalism wholesale just because you don't like capitalism and when you hear people saying wild things about how the cities are going to be underwater and millions of people are going to die and all the rest\nJust remember that there is an agenda backing some of these folks\nAnd at the alarmist productions folks like Al Gore had not in fact untrue doesn't mean we shouldn't take global warming seriously we should but that's why we should use money for abatement that's why we should be looking at building levees is why we should be looking at creating barriers to two nominees and and and figuring out exactly how to move people inland\nMeans that there are lots of ways over the course of the coming century for us to deal with some of the increased problems of climate\nBut exaggerating the problems of climate ain't going to do it and then suggesting that we overthrow capitalism to do it is not exactly a smart solution nonetheless radicalism rules of the day\nAnd it's it's driven by a sort of weird ... uh this this idea that\nWe're ... ... s gets on the way we are we're about to experience the end of time this exist in a lot of religious communities nearly Christian Community thought that sort of the the kingdom of God was at hand it's happened in the Jewish community to UC it among certain Muslim sect\nWell you see it in second in the secular world to the idea that we're living in the end times and the apocalypse has basically upon us and that means that\nHarsh action is necessary we need harsh action now we need crazed action now because we don't everyone is going to die millions will die millions will die and we keep hearing this about the increase of hurricanes and tornadoes even though there's been no actual increasing the number of hurricanes tornadoes\nWe keep hearing about these oppose it outsized impact of hurricanes and tornadoes even though for example in Bangladesh which just experienced is pretty significant hurricane or a couple of years within the last year about four thousand people died and then I\nAbout four thousand people died in the Nineteen nineties there was a similar size hurricane a hundred thousand people died what about ... actually spent the money and provided the resources necessary so that fewer people died in other words human beings\nAs intelligent animals have the capacity to adapt to our environment we've been doing it our entire existence nonetheless

have heard there was a rumor going around the office to ten years in fact a serial killer or negate Taylor Swift has finally broken her silence and it turns out just like everyone else in Hollywood and the music industry she's a person of left so here is what she tweeted\nBush put out on Instagram quote I'm writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November sex\nAnd which I'll be voting in the state of Tennessee in the past I've been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years I feel very

with no apologies what does fresh here is that there are two new follows that\nAdministration and the Bush administration and the Clinton Administration it was not clear to those of us who watch national security that the u._s. was going to focus on ... threat we're now focused let's start with Russia\nOr your experience with Russia from your dad and mom is that no matter how they dress it up their aggressive\nAnd they're aggressive especially along the boundaries of the empire\nIs it your opinion that the Trump Administration is addressing it adequately now\nQuickly now after the failures of the Obama administration to see what Ukraine represented\nI think sending ... anti tank missiles to Kiev instead of socks and blind kids is is a very a serious improvement from the Obama years\nSo yes and uh the personalities while making the decisions not just in the White House but but ... for example the gender of the joint chiefs general dumped it fully appreciate that uh\nUh KGB Kindle is always a KGB colonel and the the important way to look at Russia is not as the Soviet Union of you'll\nBut what I like to call them and the status quo act to constantly looking to destabilize uh we we tend as Americans I Love my fellow Americans we tend to posit good face on behalf of the other\nRight I'm okay you want to be yeah I I say something and I'm a maintenance and ... business that's the best yes\nThe Kremlin has never work like that whether it was run by a song whether it was run by Stalin or by KGB colonel so we now have the requisite knowledge and understanding that these are bad actors not the Soviet Union\nThis is a nation in a in demographic an economic collapse but a nation that will constantly\nTo create Eddie is world that will ... will tools which will destabilize certain regions after which they can do was exploited to their own benefit\nAnd there's a there's a eight phases and we won't go through the details there in the book but right now I Would say all those eight phases are present in a number of geography is across the edges of the empire from Syria to uh the Baltic states including Ukraine\nSo the eight phases of Russian doctrine today uh I I I credit to the Latvian ministry of defense that defense the Institute that wrote an excellent English wanted targets ... one of the primary ... above the Baltic region\nUm they wrote a wonderful English language study that I'd precis and in in my work\nAnd it's nothing very new that there's a lot of\nIn the belt way people talk of hybrid wolf fast seven generational grazed vote that's just wrapping on on old phones irregular warfare what is different is a combination and the serious ... the seriousness with which they apply irregular warfare everything is in direct\nThe focus is on the will on the non kinetic they'll send in a little green men eventually but we now know unclassified open source that prior to the uh Crimean intervention\nRussia had been undermining the Ukrainian nation state for a decade with sub version with uh other means of\nTelevision they were ... they were saying yes they were preaching propaganda millions\nOf dollars worth of propaganda being pushed into the region into the Baltic region as well right now so it it is it is the comprehensive this of their understanding of irregular warfare that is the danger\nWhen you got to the national defense university ah as the son of a man who fought the Soviets did you perceive that they saw Russia and Russia's action Russia's very good at this and always has been did they see it\nI have to admit when I arrived a there was that you could take many courses on two cities right you could take many courses on Guadalcanal\nAnd and the the most important thing you could do the most relevant thing you could do is take courses on the Balkan Wars of the Nineteen nineties so that was it was an aspect of the the syllabus the J PM me the drawing professional military education system was kind of\nFrozen

L. more Washington comes to talking\nJon ... or so I welcome mark Tom\nHe's the CEO of energy fuel this is the story of uranium in America\nA very good evening to you you are traded on the New York stock exchange traded in I Believe that ts acts as well you have uranium mines and you also produce the navy him but I Want to concentrate on the Iranian mines because this is a story from the twentieth century\nWhere are your mind and where are your production facilities right now in America and how much are they producing of what the United States needs for uranium good evening to you mark\nGood luck to you John um I mean we have a number of projects that are located mainly in the four corners region of the United states but we'd have projects from the state of Wyoming or down south through Colorado\nI'm Utah Arizona New Mexico into Texas so right now we have a three production centers that are actually producing a ... or your am\nA and two of those are are producing as we speak\nThat Nichols ranch I in Wyoming a ... white may say in Utah and also may say in Texas\nYes the only one that's on standby is all tomatoes in Texas\nAnd you have uranium mines around these production facility so how does it physically work I've never visited a uranium mine you mine and new truck and where does it go\nWell we we we have um the the three production sitters or or have ... different is that a couple of ways that we have conventional facilities where you actually physically mine drilling blast the the the or\nI'm transported to the closest thing facility in this case us white Mason meal where it's conventionally posts asked um which is crushing grinding and chemical extracting uranium Orban ATM within our project in Wyoming and in Texas are called it said to recovery and it's such a recovery is where you actually\nDissolve the uranium in place in the ground you actually don't physically mind that so so there there are two different methodologies and about half the uranium the United states or in in in the world actually is mind by both methods so about fifty percent is either conventional or it's such a recovery\nAnd your company's doing very well and people can participate but there's a but the body as how much does the United states need in uranium and how much does the U.S produce and where do we get it\nYeah well the um United States the largest consumer uranium in the world are between power generation which was about twenty percent of our electric power in the United states and then you have the nuclear navy um my calculation week or two about one third of the poll uranium consumed in in the world\nUm but but just for power generation lonely because the actual use for the military is classified\nUm but for power generation alone when we consume about fifty million pounds of uranium per year for power generation now currently a worldly Marty in a a ... percent of our requirements which is a shocking shortfall\nBecause arrested that's coming in from imports from both our allies but also from a number of a former or a communist countries you know like this or Russia or a cause Exxon or its allies and um it was back a stone at even China so um\nThat is why we filed a section two thirty to petition to limit a imports of uranium primarily from uh allies with a former Soviet Union\nLet me restate this if I understand this doesn't sound commonsense ago we're importing uranium we need for our nuclear plants and our nuclear fleet we're importing it\nPointing it from Russia and from China\nOr in life changed that tells me our supply chain is in the hands of our follows correct\n[noise] well yeah I mean that's that's the point of our petition is is the United states the United states\nAs the largest consumer of uranium in the world um is is are we ready to turn over the reins to um you know to those countries you know I I I don't\nKnow the answer is no ... we're not we're not mark you're not asking a hard question okay five but before we we look into your a conversation with the Trump Administration the department of commerce as to what we'd have to say as a missed pricing of uranium uh what is an idiot what do we use it for\n... is is primarily used as an hour away I'm for steel hardening but it is also currently getting additional I'm a demands on it from a navy employee batteries for renewable energy storage\nAnd you mind ... at the white may ... and a white ... is that where you're processing\n... well we yeah we we sit there and we're starting to recover of an ATM uh we'll start in ... in November of this year to start a producing the date him again we we last produce that avium in two thousand Thirteen [noise]\nAh we actually mine the ore are in the surrounding minds of the district and we transfer by truck as I mentioned earlier a but this initial campaign were actually recovering been eighty and that is in solution or ... or ...\nFacilities that are holding ponds so we're very excited about this is the demand for an ATM climbing\nA the demand is climbing a quite substantially probably six seven percent per year\nAnd um the price of an ATM has increased from\nA brown four or five six dollars per pound to three years ago up to north of twenty dollars per pound so um it's ... if you'd hear a lot of talk about the battery elements hum metals you know like lithium graphite cobalt will ...\nIs sort of the next to the cue when it comes from an energy renewable energy storage a type of metal\nUh but still at this they currently the largest consumption is for our voice and and ah there's currently a a news owning a in China this requiring the rebar\nUh to be a certain strength and it's very difficult to achieve that without using but avium so there's a new source of demand which is the rebar and the inflow\nBatteries back to your conversation with the Trump Administration about uranium\nWe need much more uranium than the United states is now producing your the number one producer of uranium and the country so what can be done what is the department of commerce I'm looking into what is the investigation tell us\nWe we we follow the petition and and we are asked for two things we asked for a quota another chair of quota\nThat the United states should produce at least twenty five percent of the requirements from domestic sources to allow enough critical mass so that we actually have a uranium mining industry sustainable in the United states\nWe also asked for by American uranium and and you know the the administration has his you know by American\nOr in the first place so that fits in nicely with with our request so\nUh but it's just it's a quota and it's a by American uranium and the key here is to maintain a healthy a front and the fuel cycle that does not put us dependent on\nA ... for a source of uranium primarily from these uh uh you know countries that are associated with former Soviet Union\nAnd mark or we just we have less than a minute here uh do do are follows China and Russia did they subsidize their uranium industry in order to out compete\n... yes I Do I mean the the Russia and China they have national\nThat support their nuclear fuel cycle and the United states used to but it no longer has that so that's why it's so important\nRight now because if if if we allow the nuclear fuel cycle to completely go way and the United states ah countries like Russia and China are not going to lead there's go way they're going to continue to advance for\nMark ... is the c._e._o. of energy fuels and traded publicly more to the point the Trump Administration has the conversation started about how it is that we're buying uranium from Russia and China\nThis is the John ...\nMy wife and I am thirty Washington ... ...\nAnd I posted this on the Web page the day before with a picture\nUm that they have now named to craters which ... in view during the ... in the earth famous earth rise picture the bill Anders took these two creators are in that image one they named eight homeward\nActually an honorable woman but Borman was involved in those negotiations he didn't want to create a named after him\nBut a whole board that crater was the one he keyed on when he was navigating and firing engines and the other crater they named was Anders earth rise to the bigger crater in the earth rise image and that was to honor the earth rise image itself that he'd talk\nAt a third or create a third feature on the moon was officially named mounted Maryland this is a mountain that the Jim Lovell pick named it after his wife because it's a mountain that is a key landmark for the Apollo eleven landing\nAnd he named it on his own and they have finally officially recognized that this kind of a is a ... a a correct the injustice of decades ago where they didn't name\nThings as he as the astronauts picked the A R U is is a power game and they like to control the names of every Boulder in the universe they don't really have that right and eventually that's going to dissolve away people in space will use the names that these astronaut picked without question\nTexas Vandenberg why Bob what what are they need Vandenberg for\nWhile they need to space let's Vandenberg stating mother went to space sports but they need Vandenberg right now is because you really cannot do solo synchronous all these orbits around the polls from Kennedy because you'd have to fly over\nPopulated territory and the west coast space port has been used by ... literally for half century by the military and private enterprise to get satellites into a polo or that\nAnd so now SpaceX has been flying out of ... for years but this past weekend they had their first successful launch from Vandenberg\nBut where they landed the first stage on land at Vandenberg they built a land landing site literally right next to the launch pad literally within sight within ... like two hundred yards of it and they brought that uh that first stage back it was blocked by first date which is the first\nThat their final iteration their whole this is the gold if they get it to land right next to the launch pad they could turn it around and maybe launch within twenty four hours that's their goal\nAnd so they had that success it's part of the ... and you know the races SpaceX keeps moving forward job it's a it's a sign for the future\nNot a delay F. L. S. why do these things seem familiar\n[laughter] it's an endless story well there's there's the Inside Story that is not confirmed yet that I Want to add to this off the last year Congress gave Nasser extra money to fly extra emissions of an interim upper stage\nFor S. L. S. it would not produce as much a pass powerful rocket\nBut it would allow them to fly a few\nMissions they needed to fly\nA ... before before they have the final integration out the most powerful upper stage well it appears now they're slowing down development on that at upper stage that final upper stage and they're putting more money and the scheduling low launches\nWe the interim upper stage which is powerful and if there is even hands that they are going to discontinue work on that more powerful\nUpper stage this is only after maybe five years of work on that more powerful upper stage spending lots and lots of money and they've just decided that can't afford to build it so they'll go with the ... stage [laughter]\nDuring this process high on the road put this up on behind the black and they quote the vice president and program manager space launch system for Boeing and he makes this statement I'm a there has been a slow down on the exploration upper stage work\nHe also said that uh we under estimated quote the timeframe involved somewhat and I call that possibly the biggest understatement ever in the universe because SOS has been basically under construction since ... for in some iteration or another and it's not going to launch its first manned mission until\nTwenty twenty three and it won't even be the most powerful rocket\nSo we have a commercial crew news as well Bob is is also disappointing\nDisappointing but it's not as a absurd a NASA this week released an updated scheduled to the dragon install lying a test flight so these are the cap privately built capsules to bring people die obsessed and that meant space sex headed the way it's first man\nFirst manned test flight until June ... they didn't\nGet the ... the time between the two missions has the same so it was just because they're scheduled essentially at I assessed they had a delay it and a bowling scheduled pretty much stays the same so there's been a slight delay that won't be any commercial crew launches this year but with that right now it looks very clear that they're going to all be happening next year\nI'm a ... says we're now going to be giving updates on schedule on a much more frequent basis\nBecause we're really firming things up for example the bowling flights they give very rough approximate periods like mid twenties Nineteen\nNow saying clearly the first unmanned in March twenty Nineteen and the first flight manned flight in August twenty Nineteen so they really from the schedules up we should look at space experts on land in January Boeing's first unmanned in March\nA space sex first manned in June and then bowling manned in August every other month dislike the Gemini program back in the Nineteen sixties [laughter] it'll be very exciting\nThis year just finished a constant basis for had corners so we have two different directions Bob what how they're going to settle this is there a tug of war team that's going to show up and\nTurf war within a the bureaucracy um you know Trump is pushing for a new space Boston so the military bureaucracy is putting forth all kinds of falls about what they should do [noise] um\nI'm not sure even plan is a good while on both of the one of them from the agency from the military itself suggests creating an agency that they say a smaller and will be more lean Michael Griffin who is form and that sort of straight who's now been\nPut in a on our secretary of defense for research and engineering Mike\n... yes and he was basically fit into the space area hit the supposed to be there to deal with\nMilitary space he's proposing a different idea which would create a new space agency for the military with the staff of a hundred and twelve people and I have to say when reading just the initial report it seemed like his was more bloated than the other I'm not sure which is right I'm the one thing that Griffin was doing that the military proposed\nAir force secretary Heather Wilson now as well to\nThat she's in charge so Griffin was pushing law the trip to trends transition the military to using private commercial assets rather than building that's all and um [noise]\nBut his apparent love to build his own and buy here might work against that goal I'm not sure which works I I once again my real reservations about the state's forces that I'm worried it's going to just turn into a a big bureaucracy that won't really accomplish very much they just simply need to consolidate the off some\nBob you're not thinking about we need our space uniforms we need patches of merchandise we need all the things you're trying to bypass Bobby Washington they only build empires that's what they do\nI Know this is the tragedy that's why I have reservations about the whole idea I'm not sure they're going to ... the people who work in Washington to my mind the bureaucrats they're all very little interested in the national interest nowadays the only thing they seem to be interested in it appears to me is their own agency interest\nOn the national interest can go to act by Bob\nYeah I I have to get that uniform and the patch and so if they need to build an empire to get to it All right fine we go now to China because there's news on Chang eat for this is the next lunar is this the far side of the moon Landrieu yes\nThis is the land that's going to go on the far side of the moon\nSchedule is now tend to lay a pretty firmly tentatively that that that sounds weird uh sometime in December the key is that they've got three\nLaunches for the same space sport to do other things prior to it and if anything goes wrong on any of those launches that will delayed Chang gave for but right now that set to land on the far side of the mood some\nLaunch sometime in December and that will land some very shortly thereafter there's a lot of other information including details about the landing site which is in a crater called bar of on common\nIt's on the far side of the moon in a can base and\nAnd the pictures of what would what looks like on the surface it's rough on the side of the boat they already have their ... satellite in orbit around the moon ready to

wholesome and in is the super camp under construction\nA that is going to come up in the fall of Seventeen but before that ours yours are moved through a series of camps I've checked off the ones you spend time with Neal\nFarms that seems to be a swamp a ... a crop field is crude a onus broke out ... ... cars crude bad cold burgers crude so these camps for a variety there was not one standard camp they were white rap requisition ing a villages to make camps out of them\nYeah they were ... requisition villages they record wrecked positioning a former barracks um sometimes work camps that\nUh for instance farms that which was in the middle of the swamp\nOr whatever they could get their hands on in order to house these prisoners and some of these places particularly for the enlisted ranks we're roughly cobbled together essentially just some fences and some um rudimentary hearts but for the officers there was this certain requirements that they deserved I'm\nA better housing better conditions and so for the large part you find that uh they were housed in Austin abrupt for instance which was of of a former hotel or clubs style as well\nBe camps that were closest to the ... the Netherlands Puerto Holland\nHolland is the free zone you get to Holland you're out of the war craft field is very close within walking distance I say a couple of nights just sold off as close an awesome broke his clothes and our heroes spend time there and make breaks routinely back breaks\nRoutinely make break David Gray um makes a break from Creigh failed he spoke German fluently he had a some other officers are helped him a disguise himself as a German officer and a German uniform and one\nMorning he just walked through the gates says for how to forge past the good morning to the to the guards and then walk themselves straight out of the of the game\nThe challenge to get to the border means that you're passing through uh the German population and with border guards I think he said the ... the border with Hollande is three hundred and fifty miles it did have guards but not that not guard towers not wires\nI mean the the the border with Hollande was was very was many things sometimes there were fences and guards other times the topography was the defense alone and so you really had to target where you rented\nHad to target where you were going to go to Carl where you were going to cross\nThe a gathering of our heroes is a happenstance\nBecause they're moved around some times\nBecause of inspections now let's go to ... and Holtzman and is constructed\nBecause all of these rascals have not been contained by the various levels of camps Holtzman then is given to wanna twin brothers and we need to introduce the villain here Niemeyer what do we need to know about Niemeyer at ... and his brother Neymar well\nA crony Meyer who was the a combination of Holtzman was an absolute abortion tyrant or the he was called the cat he was called the road by by the British um the number of ... or you could not count he was\nBorn in Germany um suppression officers spent some time about Seventeen years in the United states are doing any number of things are a bill you'd make or a bartender\nA Niemeyer was also an inveterate liar so he was a spy he was brought down um\nYou know served on the front was a hero he was very many things but what he was most of all a was a tyrant a he was a cruel a commandant and when you walked into a whole minute he pointed at your chest and said you will never escape this camp hold\nSpending as what we would translate in the twentieth century as a war criminal and uh his conduct is a brutal butts exceptionally brutal for the first war this was not routine what we've come to accept as German behavior did not exist yet\nCorrect I mean most of these officers or David ... for instance uh when he left gray failed he went all the way to the border he mistook one town for another and was recaptured he was brought back\nHe was sentenced to isolation but but that was some of the punishment and ...
