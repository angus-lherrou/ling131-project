Wisconsin Josh your next step on the mark within show I'm Larry O'Connor\nIowa aerial I'm good I I'm concerned though because if the Democrats do get the majority in the house this is going to be a rough two years\nAnd I have an idea I'm a ... string color and I said that a good idea that they should do is they could show Detroit\nWhen it's ran by businessmen like Donald Trump say in Henry Ford and the strength that Detroit once had and then once Democrat liberals takeover and all it just falls into corruption in squalor and just showed them side by side and then even better for my own state I think they don't tell their mouth\nIf we let politician and take over you get Detroit if you let Republicans take over and have ideas we get Foxconn and he'd do look for jobs that we're getting a little shocked and I yeah I Wish they were told that more and more and more and they don't\n[noise] yeah and you know Josh I'm Glad you brought this up because I I Love Wisconsin and I think that a year Governor Scott Walker has done some great jobs and it is incredible turn around what he's been able to achieve in that state and of course they all said that people would be fired and people would be starving in the streets and no one would get an education and it's been phenomenal\nYeah we saw in the ... the number and Madison there were all yes and that took on our capital and we fought right short and look at what we've been able to accomplish that choice is second half of the tournament Donald Trump is said if we fight the good fight and vote on November ... that'll happen\nThank you Josh thank you for the call appreciate it thanks for coming into the market within show ya I vividly remember those mobs taking over the capital occupying the capital of Madison during the early years of the Scott Walker or the governorship but that was back when I was working with Andrew Breitbart and Andrew Andrew got on a plane\nThe next day he sent us all a text message I'm going to Madison\nIn the winter in Southern California guy who asked her why are you going in Madison\nThe next day he sent us all a text message I'm going to Madison in the winter\nIn Southern California guy who Andrew why are you going to Madison look at what's going on there look at the mobs look at the riots look at the [noise] look at Scott Walker needs us Republicans need us\nConservatives who are trying to bring sane rational governance to the state of Wisconsin need us and he sure did go there by the way right next door to you there are Josh over in Michigan [noise]\nThis is a remarkable thing\nYou know everywhere you go right now on cable news broadcast news all over the Internet who do you hear about running for Senate this young upstart appealing good looking guy who's who's a defy the odds and has a real chance to win all you're hearing about is this guy Beto O'Rourke\n... doesn't have a chance to win in Texas\n[noise] better better work is not going to win the Senate seat\nIn Texas [noise]\nAnd it's all made for TV we've seen this game before every\nTwo years every election they tell us about the new rising star in Texas was finally going to take paint Texas blue you know when Hillary Clinton was a deciding not to do any sort of polling or appearances in Wisconsin Pennsylvania well not Pennsylvania she did appearance ... in Wisconsin or Michigan\nOr that she was actually at that time\nContemplating spending more money in Texas because she was so sure she was going to win Texas\nAnd Georgia and Arizona and she ... she wanted to to this was going to be a transformative election with Hillary Clinton and the remaking of the map\nWe hear this all the time the ... but it's not true\nAnd meanwhile in Michigan there's this guy John James\n[noise] the last poll there showed him in single digits now this guy a running against Debbie Stabenow I mean he is he's a former military [noise] ah ... combat in Iraq\nUh this guy is African American this guy is conservative this guy is right on all the issues here I Want to play a little bit of of him because [noise] because this tells you exactly how the media so corrupt\nBecause all they care about with federal Rourke it has to do with two things it has to do with forcing this fake narrative\nThat the Democrats are really that the Texas is moving blue Texas is going to be a Democrat state Texas is not the same Texas because the Democratic demographic changes because uh because of all of the radical conservative policies that have hurt that state which I haven't I mean\nPeople are flocking to Texas people are flocking to Texas because of the economy there is one of the only state to persevere through the eight ... years of ... because they had Republicans in charge of that state there's no way that people have Texas would reverse that trend\nBut also because they hate Ted Cruz the media hates Ted Cruz because he's so good so smart and so conservative so they're they're they're putting this beta will work guy up and meanwhile listen I got a little bit of a John James this a really impressive guy in Michigan\nReal leadership is what's needed in Washington in order to ensure the

his love for this country full support of the president I mean I come on if he if he were running against Ted Cruz you think we'd hear more about John James\nIf he were a Democrat do you think we'd be hearing a little bit more why why is everyone obsessed with better work when he was basically running\nThe justice far behind Ted Cruz and the latest polls then John James is running behind Debbie Stabenow and you know the answer to that question\nYou know very well the answer the question [noise]\nHow about GM down in uh her non do Florida I'm Larry O'Connor you're listening to the mark within show what is a gym\nI just want to start the Democrat or the Republicans should be talking about yeah\nIs what the Democrats are not talking about [noise] about gun control the economy jobs on I'm going to the table for one case the media is driving the narrative and they're doing that in the pocket of the Democrats\n[noise] yet Jim you're right all the Republicans need to know what they should be talking about in the next to the two and a half weeks you're absolutely right all the thing\nThe Democrats [noise] yet Jim you're right all the Republicans need to know what they should be talking about in the next to the two and a half weeks you're absolutely right all the things that the Democrats are avoiding and that includes the fight over judge Kavanaugh now justice Kevin I notice how no one talks about that anymore it's completely disappeared why do you think that is Jim\nOh geez I Wonder that because the media is driving it there are saying okay well that's not important anymore

us\n[noise] and if you listen to most of our elected officials guess what their rights we can't stop them what are we going to do [noise]\nYou know the Democrats and sadly many Republicans on Capitol

deporting criminals in this country for violating our immigration laws\nIt's a very clear cut policy by the way one that believe it or not used to be embraced by Democrats to\nHand Republicans [noise]\nUntil they figured out that they could get votes and or campaign donations respectively\n[noise] for being an international is for being all about open borders for being compassionate [noise] ah you know what's compassionate compassionate does not enabling people to continue to follow the\nSame broken destructive patterns that they have year after year after decade after decade\nYou know what's compassionate wanting the Honduran people to be empowered to alter and change the Honduran government or the Mexican government you're terrified for your life in Honduras\nI get it gets what we

in Maryland here in the greater Washington area is running for reelection and I asked him that I said you know what what should we do to stop these people from coming into the country last lesson 'cause this is very this is very indicative of of how they think and how they talk what should we do to stop that should we stop that\n[noise] one of the reasons we've had a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America\nOh it's been supportive bipartisan by Democrats or Republicans voted in President Trump's budget we want to improve the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America\nAnd he goes on on this and think about what she's saying here and this is this is considered to be the the the the highest level of statesmanship in Washington DC\nWe've got thousands and thousands of people who make no Bones Are secret about the fact that they are demanding entry into our country because they hate the country they're living in\nAnd the politically correct acceptable ... old man on Capitol Hill response is well how many billions can we get to that government down there to improve\nConditions and by the way we send billions and billions and billions and billions already and somehow it hasn't solved the problem [noise]\nAnd and think about what the basis of this argument is to stop people from invading our borders we must throw billions of dollars to their countries it's extortion\n[noise]\nThey were being them we're bribing the government's down there to get control of their own citizenship and then you get the Mexican government leadership and for that matter hundred that all of these countries in Central America where their citizenship is leaving in droves to go to another country [noise]\nAnd they're angry at us for saying no they can't come in the ... about that for a minute you are an elected official you've been elected by your population in El Salvador in in Guatemala in Mexico you've been elected to represent them\nYou've been elected to run the affairs of the country [noise]\nAnd the people who elected you are fleeing your country\nTo go elsewhere and your responses not gee maybe we're doing something wrong maybe we need to fix our country no your response is how dare you America not allow my citizens to fully my in apt to corrupt government to come into your country\nThese countries spend more time focusing on our policies then fixing their own and then you got a Democrat like Ben Carson who enables at who enables at by throwing more money at it [noise]\nSo I came back we went back and forth on this earlier today when if you want you can get the whole interview over at a my radio station to be a male\nDot com but I I came back around and I said All right listen I Know you want to throw a bunch of money at this government and you want to do all of these things on the ground to keep them from going but that's not going to stop these four thousand okay there on the way\nAnd frankly whatever money you send down there you've already sent plenty and that hasn't fix the problem I don't know how much more money you got to spend [noise]\nBut let's focus on what's happening right now because you have a lot of criticism for President Trump for saying he's going to send the military down there for saying he's going to cut funding if these countries don't stop their own citizens from playing yeah you have all this criticism of him for actually trying to protect our borders so what would you do your senator for crying out loud [noise]\nWhat's the solution how do you stop these people from coming into our country when they reach our border what are we supposed to do\n[laughter] I don't know if I'll agree with you on on that statement I I I've been

rebar steel line in the sand you know follow through on that\nThen you'd be amazed\nYou'd be amazed at how things will go\nA will continue to calls in a moment I Want to circle back to initiate on my friend Dan bungee often sits in this chair as well and I've known down since I first they actually before I even came to Washington and he's been so great on this issue with Spygate and with the FBI and the ... and\nAh all that jazz and I've been doing a quite a bit on that story as well\nUh I recently this week to interview Carter Page and a quarter page is a central figure\nOf the a spy gates scandal right uh and and he hasn't done a whole lot of media but I was able to have a quite an extensive conversation he's in the news this week and I don't know if you saw this but Carter Page has filed a defamation lawsuit\nAgainst the Democratic National Committee and against a ... which is a a high powered D.C law firm that represented the DNC and by extension the Hillary Clinton campaign you know in the presidential campaign when a person gets the nomination for a party they are the de facto head of that party\n... and especially I implore you read Donald Brazil's book it's called hacked\nAnd it's a double entendre it's partly about the Russian thing but it's also about what happens\nHer experience taking over the DNC after Debbie Wasserman Schultz who was a mess was completely mess and she she tells a lot of troops in this book about how awful Debbie Wasserman Schultz was and how terrible the Hillary Clinton campaign was to her personally and to the DNC\nHow the Hillary Clinton campaign absolutely ran roughshod over them a bill to them for whatever money that was coming in\nAnd they were in charge of all of it All right so so when you hear that the DNC hired a farm through a lawyer to create fusion GPS to to create the Russian dot CA\nThat apparently you know sly and Carter Page uh that really means that Hillary Clinton campaign\nBecause they call the shots so not Carter Page this week prior to death filed a defamation lawsuit against them against the DMZ and against a ... now why did he go after those people will be I think it's because they have deep pockets frankly [laughter] that's where the money is\nAnd and and had it not been for those two entities there wouldn't have been a Russian dot CA there wouldn't have been stories saying that Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government there wouldn't have been a a a five to warrant\nA petition for and approved to the FBI petition for by the FBI unapproved through the courts for them to survey on him to look into every little or if is of his electronic\nFootprints via email text messages phone calls and the people who associate with him for over a year they kept getting this are incredibly intrusive\nSpy warrants vet that without a fight the war and it is against the law for a federal agency to spy on an American citizen the only way they can do it it's real fights or worn and they're supposed to be a very high bar to get a ... so Warren\nTend to get this Pfizer weren't they had to use the the Russian dot CA the claims Carter Page was and they in fact if you look at the applications for the warrant for the price of weren't the FBI said we believe Carter Page is an agent of the Russian government it's not right there in black and white\nAnd we believe that he was working on behalf of the Russian government to alter American foreign policy through his meddling in the presidential campaign of twenty six tape on behalf of Donald Trump that's what they said that's what they claim that's what they maintained under oath to the court\n[noise] to Carter Page filed a defamation lawsuit this week [noise]\nSuing the DNC and ... this law firm for defamation\nNow think about this from it [noise] Carter Page\nIs either an agent with the Russian government and basically participated in a ... versus\nHis either an agent with the Russian government and basically participated in a subversive if not outright treasonous acts against our nation [noise]\nDuring the twenty sixteen presidential election\nOr he has an innocent American citizen who has been signed and slandered into famed and used as a tool for political purposes not just by the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign but ultimately by the Justice Department and the Obama administration [noise]\nYou've got to be one of the other\nFreight ... there's no in between here there is no if and or certainly no but I mean if there was a button hero it'd be a car Daschle and proportions [noise]\nCarter Page is either as stool or a a sorry a stewardship of the prudent Kremlin\nFor he is completely innocent\nAnd indeed I don't know if you know a lot about credit pays like I said it hasn't done a lot of the media [noise] he's a Naval Academy graduate he was a navy officer as all Naval Academy graduates are unless they're you know pro athletes [noise] he was in intelligence\nIn the navy and an officer in the intelligence division which you know usually you've got some hurdles that you have to cross to get into\nMilitary intelligence in the United States Navy as an officer [noise]\nUm and after serving his time well beyond his obligated time as an officer after he got his a Naval Academy education he then went into private business and did we went into the energy sector he got his doctorate by the way he is about the ever noticed that\nYou can't say Christine Blasey Ford's name without saying Dr Ford but one of the last time they said Dr Carter Page\nHe's a doctor he got his doctorate [noise]\nAnd he didn't do dealings with energy sectors out of Russia you can argue with that if you want but understand most of his dealings were in the house in days when Hillary Clinton had to reset button when Bill Clinton was pulling down six figures for giving a speech in Moscow\nAnd when a bronco bomber was promising his counterpart there that he'd have more flexibility after he got rid of this ah this Mitt Romney guy in won reelection\nSo it was a different time it was a different era it was okay to do business with Moscow snow he's still thinks it's a good idea to do business with Moscow he actually doesn't think the government is as bad as everyone says that's what that's not a legal\nHe he can do that in fact it's not illegal for a business to do business with Moscow as right now as we speak\nSo sanctions and in a in a huge way against that government their individual sanctions against individuals but uh businesses can still do but we we still do business with Moscow\nYou may disagree but guess what he has the right to do that that doesn't make them a spy it doesn't make him a Russian agent now he could be don't misunderstand my point here [noise] Carter Page could very well be\nAn agent of the Russian government as the FBI maintained based on the Russian dot CA paid for by the DNC and this law firm that Carter Page is now suing but ask yourself something as you evaluate the story as you use your cognitive skills\nYour reasoning the brain that the good lord gave you\nAs you evaluate the story that is presented to you that the FBI and the Obama administration said Carter Page was an agent of the Russian government and has been for years and worked on behalf of the Kremlin and let him are prudent to colluded with Donald Trump to meddle in the twenties sixteen presidential election as they say that\n[noise] understand to facts number one\nTo this day\nHas charged Carter Page with anything\nNot James Comey\nNot Loretta Lynch\nThat Jeff Sessions not Rod Rosenstein\nNo one at the federal level no one of the local level no one at the state level Carter Page has not been charged with a crime of any kind and they have sort of veiled every inch of his whole life\nFor almost two years they've got everything on him\nNo charges number one so so think about that for a minute and then think about this if you're Carter Page\nAnd you are an agent of the Russian government\nAnd you did commit near treasonous acts\nBy colluding with the Trump campaign and a vitamin ... Kremlin to alter our presidential election and twenty sixteen if\nIf that were true\nWhy would you file a lawsuit\nWhy would you file a defamation lawsuit against the DNC because you see the perfect the fact that the DNC\nCan defend themselves and get out of this lawsuit\nWith one very simple strategy\nIt's only defamation if it isn't true\nSo all they got to do is proof that Carter Page\nNation if it isn't true\nSo all they got to do is proof that Carter Page\nIs in fact an agent of the Russian government and if you're Carter Page why would you invite that\nWhy would you open yourself up to discovery why would you open yourself up to a full court well funded and you know there's going to be a lot of money funding their defense all well funded investigation", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The John Batchelor Show", "city": "Washington", "day": "21"}
