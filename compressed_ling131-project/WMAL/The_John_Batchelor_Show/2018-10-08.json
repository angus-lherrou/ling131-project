enjoy the show [noise]\nWe'll filmed the do yourself investors show this is Chris ... enjoying the do's and don'ts of the financial markets sex or sponsor online training academy generous contributions to make the show hospitable online training academy has\nBeen helping individuals like you become do yourself investors since Nineteen Ninety seven\nOnline training academy as two campuses to serve our listening audience one and Tyson's corner and one near BWI Airport\nAnd the past few weeks we've been talking about some of the strategies you can do to emulate what the financial services folks charge you for\nAnd ways to reduce your fees and expenses and basic keep them in your own pocket\nAs opposed to giving them to a stranger so a couple of weeks ago we talked about building your own annuity and Sam side and walk us through how we would use our views are assets protected from market risk make sure there was no downside but then also use that\nUse that the income to buy options on the S. and P. five hundred so we'd have no stock market risk and have stock market upside and be able to do that for the long haul which is basically what\nThe ... the the professional annuity folks are doing and what they're doing for the privilege is that they're charging high fees high expenses and duties are the highest the\nHighest highest commission product available for financial services so there's a time when a new T. makes a lot of sense when you're in the deep humiliation phase and so as you're entering retirement or later on in life and might make sense to have an annuity but it would make more sense\nIf you were able to manage that annuity yourself and keep the fees and expenses in your pocket as opposed to giving them to someone else and also last week we talked about building a diversified portfolio and\nReally simple find that down one of the things that the financial services folks always talk about his importance of a financial plan and you know if you have you know millions of dollars are several hundred thousand dollars no bill ... produce a financial plan for you for a thousand or two thousand\nIf you have you know millions of dollars are several hundred thousand dollars a bill ... produce that financial plan for you for a thousand or two thousand dollars or more than that and then they'll charge you a fee to maintain that plan\nAnd invariably the financial services plans are passive investing plans [laughter] so the idea is you're going to pay us money and you're going to keep paying us money for the privilege of not having to do anything and\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills\nOr even just having the luxury of not working so hard to have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share but there's all kinds of stories here's what one racing graduate had to say\nHi bartender that a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different I needed my time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... happy and career and training something that I had always wanted to death and sell it to die for that had a chemical or start that changed my life\nLearn more visitors on line that free O T a class dot com that's free OT a class dot com\nBack to the do yourself investor show and I really appreciate Jerry's enthusiasm and that the enthusiasm that are instructors bring to our students every day\nOf being part of a global education community\nPlace it's focused on\nWorking together building an education community of like minded people that are focused on doing better for their current income\nDoing better for their future income and preserving what they've got and so today we're walking us through what a success plan looks like Ford do it yourself investors and how online training academy works with their students to help you develop that success plan\nAnd then once we have the overall goals of what you're trying to accomplish in why then we're going to help you identify some preservation strategies\nThat are not these wacky Hi fi high risk strategies at the financial services people have you take\nBut things where we can take you out of the market risk give you the opportunity to generate similar return but do it in a way where you are in control and you're not paying someone for the privilege of them losing your money\nAnd what you're doing is you're able to retain the fees and expenses yourself\nBecause you're not generating high fees you're not generating high expenses you get to keep those in your pocket and that improves your overall peace of mind that improves your ability to sleep at night\nAnd having preservation strategies that are designed to make you money as opposed to someone else and that's the foundation for your overall success plans and at the end of the day you know as one of the things that we know is that people you know you're wealthy if you're listening to show your one of the wealthiest people in the world\nBut you don't feel wealthy because\nYou've been told to be afraid of the future you've been told that bad things are going to happen to you and if you're unprepared if you're on the educated then yeah you're going to be taken advantage of\nAndme all we want you to do is be able to understand how the market really works and we're opportunities are to protect yourself\nAnd that's going to give yourself just a better way to put a good move forward in the world\nAnd so real simple you know in the market you know you've heard you have to buy low and sell high well ask yourself this do you have a system\nFor identifying where is the buy low and do you have a system that will help you identify where is the cell high opportunity because real simple you know businesses make money by buying a wholesale and selling retail whether that's Wal Mart or Costco yeah wherever you go\nEvery business has a strategy to buy low and sell higher\nAnd unfortunately for most people in their financial world they're not doing that and they don't have a system they don't have a way to read today's volatile markets you know things are going up and down every day\nAnd most people look at that and they have no idea what's going on do you think you'd be able to get better returns safer returns if you understood how the market's really work\nAnd that's part of giving getting yourself educated and then learning a system that's designed to make it easier for you to make money\nAnd control your risk while that's happening and so you have to be successful do it yourself investor first you have to protect what you've got\nThen you've got to be able to position where you got them\nWell that's happening and so you know to be successful do it yourself investor first you have to protect what you've got\nThen you've got to be able to position where you've got the third you have to profit from what you've got\nAnd so part of our success plan you know the focus on building the foundation affirmed foundation of preservation that's where you learn how to protect what you've got and in some markets teams up\nYou know you don't want to keep buying as the market goes up you want to be taking some money off the table and positioning yourself to take advantage of other opportunities as they arise and so I was talking to my cousin a few weeks ago\nAnd I understand where he's coming from 'cause I was there with him years ago\nAnd what happens is is this whole idea that you have to be a hundred percent invest at all times well what that means is you're absorbing market risk at all times and if you don't have a clear idea of what your award is you're taking risk with a low opportunity for award\nAnd what we know is that there's always ups and downs in the market and so\nIf you want to absorb all the ups and downs you are going to end up with at best average returns [noise] if you're paying fees and expenses you're going to have at best below average returns and that's what most people are satisfied with in the market\nYourself investors shouldn't be satisfied with below average returns and we want people that say you know what I Know there's a way\nIf I had a systematic way to identify whereas a safe place to buy in a safe place to sell I'd be able to get better returns you know that's what being do yourself investors all about so we need people with some fire in the belly that are motivated to make a change and motivated to find out\nHow to engage the market more successfully\nBecause there's things that people do all the time that get in your way of success and so you know to the two basic mistakes that people make\nIs that you know you've been trained to buy after things charge up you know the news is good price is going to the moon and your condition to buy right there\nAnd then when things are crashing\nAnd news is bad that's when you decide to sell and well one of the things we'll talk about the free half day classes that there's no other part of life where you take those actions in the face of the same information when prices going up you won't buy right because it's too expensive\nWhen prices are crashing when things are on sale if you have a coupon where you can get a discount that's when you buy\nAnd you wait for the sale whether it's Black Friday whether it's just the you know the coupons and the newspaper on the weekend that you're looking for a good opportunity you know Columbus Day is upon us as probably sales where you're going to buy your stuff that you wouldn't have bought two weeks ago\nBecause who on earth would pay full price and in the financial markets you have to ask yourself who on earth would pay full price and what you'll realize is that you are paying full price with your four one K. contributions you're paying full price when you're buying things after there's a big move up\nAnd then you have to shovel why on earth I Am I doing that because I Would never do that and and the other aspect of my life and once you make that realization that you've been trained\nTo act in the financial markets in the way that makes no sense then you're going to start realizing that you can be trained to do things that do make sense and that's part of our core strategy gives you a systematic way to identify where's the safe place to buy and where's the safe place to sell\nAnd part of it is is being patient enough\nFor the opportunity to come to you\nAnd so I Know Sunday's are days people are watching football well on Sunday while you're watching football you can also be identifying safe place to buy and safe places to sell\nFalse on Sunday you can set up what we call the set and forget trades\nAnd see what happens during the week\nAnd we certainly have students that do that on a weekly basis you can do it in the morning before you go to work you do it at night\nBefore you go to sleep and then you know when you come home from work and said did I make money today when you wake up in the morning even say that I make money today than we have some students who put their orders in\nBefore they go to bed into the forest market\nWhen they wake up they find out they made money or not I mean who wouldn't want to make money when they're sleeping and that's part of the power of becoming a do it yourself investor is being able to do things that you didn't realize you could do\nAnd giving yourself the opportunity to be more successful starts with the making a decision to stop doing what everybody else is doing and start doing things that makes sense for you and so stop buying Heinz\nSo the making a decision to stop doing what everybody else is doing and start doing things that makes sense for you and so stop buying high and selling low\nIf you could make that decision\nThen that would have a severe impact positively on your current income it would also have a severe impact positively on your future income if you just understood how to not buy and sell low but to start buying low and selling high\nYou're trying to pay your property taxes without ask grows might be more trouble than it's worth it and I'll be right back with more real estate now and say [noise]\nThere goes your ... [noise]\nHey are\nYou thinking about selling your home and do you want to know how to sell your home fast and for the most money Hi I'm Eric Stewart and I'm the host appointing you home right here on W. M. A. L. and I'd like to invite you to join me for my flagship seminar and how to sell your home for top dollar in Maryland to hand in Virginia in October [noise]\nIt's free foot space is limited and it's filling up fast so called today eight hundred nine hundred and Ninety One oh four that's eight hundred nine hundred and Ninety One oh four four register online at Eric Stewart groups\nReal estate now we can get rid of doors [noise]\nThe temptation to pay our own property taxes without escrow is tempting and the idea being that if you own real estate which I'm assuming that you either do or will at some point or have in the past\nYou may have a property tax bill and we'll just use a number to say how much it costs you live in your home and taxes let's say it's five thousand dollars a year and property tax\nIf you're paying mortgage payment to your lender you can either choose to include one twelve of the cost of your property taxes is a part of your monthly mortgage payment on your mortgage lender will\nAccumulate all of that and pay your property taxes when they become do they put it into an escrow or\nYou could choose to ask grow your own money which is to take that four hundred and fifty dollars whatever two a month and put it in your own savings account and save it for a year until the property taxes are do and then you pay it and the idea is that if you were discipline and did that every month\nThe four fifty would go into an account and let's say the account earns two percent and returned\nAlthough you wouldn't have a full five thousand dollars in that account at the beginning of the year it would grow over time two percent against a a mean of about twenty five hundred dollars halfway between the five thousand in zero that you started with\nTwo percent of twenty five hundred dollars was about fifty dollars in interest but she would make the fifty dollars rather than your bank making that money by sitting in escrow account with them\nThe challenge and I think the real problem is that it just doesn't work that well you can get into a lot of trouble as well by doing this so let me explain where it gets kind of interesting so if you're a lender ignores the payment that you've made which it has the potential is doing and I've heard of this happening [laughter]\nThey may send in a tax payment anyways but they may not and if that happens and they do you have a duplicate payment of the tax bill with the lender saying that they were responsible for the payment when you think that you were so all of a sudden\nThe state has got to large sums of money and then you've got to figure it out and get it worked out now that's not as likely to happen\nBut let's say they ignore you and the lender doesn't pay the tax bill you've paid your tax bill but the amount of your monthly payment\nActually stays the same so all of a sudden your your lender saying we want you to pay the full amount of your mortgage payment\nWhich would include what your mortgage payment would be plus the taxes but you're the one who's paying the taxes now you're actually paying your lender more than you should you're lenders obligated to review your escrow account on an annual basis and determine whether the mound you're escrow account is accurate or not\nI Will get a statement from my lender each year\nUsually I have to increase the amount of my monthly payment buying them out because the taxes and the jurisdiction of gone up a little bit as taxes are known to do or because the insurance on the property which is also being asked grow it has gone up sometimes though I'll pay too much because of an adjustment of some kind and I get some money back\nHappy day be on the lookout by the way for anything that comes through your lender make sure you open every thing you'll understand you sometimes there's a check in there doesn't look like it's a check it looks like it's a bill or solicitation to buy some kind of insurance in case\nYou know your sewer line backs up something completely unnecessary generally so be aware of that it's often times just the hassle of having to then remember to cut the check and then to put the check in the mail and maybe you do make a little bit of money but isn't it easier just to pay one amount every month to know that they'll handle it for you I think so\nThe check and then to put the check in the mail and maybe you do make a little bit of money but isn't it easier just to pay one amount every month to know that they'll handle it for you I think so\n\nNo you know the primary residence each one of us has is a place that we call home primary residence would be the home that you buy live in when you decide you're no longer going to live in your home as your primary residence\nYou're going to live someplace else the day you move out of that property and declare another property as your primary residence that becomes your primary residence let me just explain for those who are not familiar it's a house or apartment that you call home okay it could be a houseboat\nCould be a trailer could be an apartment or house it's also the address that your driver's license has on your automobile registration your voter registration card because your primary residence affects how much you have to pay a tax time it's very important\nThat you identify this primary residence carefully it's not just the IRS\nThat looks at the interest that you're paying the taxes that your pain but also the county oftentimes for instance where I live there's a tax on my property called the property tax guess what there is a discount if the property I'm living in in my county is my primary residence\nI don't get that this kind of it's not my primary residence and I have to apply for that discount\nSenior citizens in my county can apply to receive a discount additionally if they live in their home for a certain length of time and are of a certain age so there are options\nFor reducing your tax burden in your primary residence\nRemember too that the primary residence when it comes to capital gains works this way if you purchased a home and you move into the property let's say the property's worth two hundred thousand dollars you move into this is your principal residents and after Twenty years that home is now selling for seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars\nAnd after you pay the commissions and the transfer tax you've got a net capital gains of five hundred thousand between you and your wife selling that property and you've lived in the property to the last five years as your principal residents and you've never depreciated the property by moving out of it and appreciate it on your taxes\nBy the way I'm not an account and let me clarify make sure you're clear on that but as a real estate agent with thirty one years experience I'm speaking having seen a lot\nTo take it for what it's worth which with a a nickel buy you a cup of coffee but you know I probably blew that did not cast isn't it with\nA with a nickel I couldn't even\nBuy a cup of coffee I think a dime a dime now okay thanks his own me a dime thank you ... I feel better now having known that I was under bidding that you can reference me anytime you know I'm always for your ... can is the engineer for\nReal estate now we're glad he's on board can is a great engineer being with us Twenty years twenty five years Thirty years forty or fifty years almost sixty years now\n[laughter] I don't mind but it seems like [laughter]\nAnyway so you can write off each person in a like if you buy a house or your cell by yourself you write off up to two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and capital gains if their properties you're selling as your primary residence and you've lived in at two out of five years I guess what\nYou could buy a home fix it up resell it take to gain after two years and go do that again and again and again every two years\nIt requires moving but it's a way for you to make tax free money\nWhat homebuyers need to know when mortgage rates are rising\nIs that a little bit of an increase in the raid\nActually appreciate\nThe ability of a homebuyer to purchase real estate let me explain\nYour monthly mortgage payment will go up by two hundred and forty four dollars a month on a five hundred thousand dollar loan them out according to a deputy chief economist at Freddie Mac I actually did the math\nI came up with two hundred Ninety dollars calculating what the factor is for every thousand dollars a Jew borrowing a thirty year cycle what is the factor at three and five eight sources foreign five eighths which is a difference between last year and this year\nThat difference means that you could afford to buy sixty three thousand dollars worth of house if you were on the cusp of affordability able to buy but just barely a houses six hundred putting a hundred thousand dollars down\nYou now could afford to buy a five hundred and thirty seven thousand dollar house because you're affordability has dropped by sixty three thousand dollars a big difference when rates rise it can definitely affect your ability to buy the home you really want\nWell this is relocation nations sponsored show real estate now relocation nationwide be find the best agents anywhere in the world to go to relocation nation

stiff and or had body aches a high fever I went to lie down in this little bed my grandmother had in the kitchen\nAnd ah that's where she took naps I guess when she was cooking but anyway I I I was lying down in the the relatives started coming over and saying things like oh this is what happened to your cousin when he got polio and this is what happened to your older brother when he got sick and died the next day so they were just scaring the heck out of me\nAnd uh my grandmother my mother were very upset and I kind of drifted off into asleep and then I woke up\nA few hours later and ah I saw this really bright light up in the ceiling between the beams and this old farmhouse\nAnd the ceiling and it was very warm and it was very bright who is in the ... what I Would call in and jelly shape and it kind of a humanoid shape\nAnd uh I the best thing about it was that I felt like everything would be okay I didn't have any more worries I I I I felt fine I went back to sleep and when I woke up in the morning I was completely well I didn't have any any health issues at all and my mother and my grandmother said it was a a\nA miracle and that was my guardian angel and I I think that's\nWhat opened the floodgates or for the rest of my life I started having these paranormal experiences are quite\nOften and uh uh uh you know kind of randomly but but very often frequently\nShare

had\nYes a loved about Eighteen years old a specially way especially if you're driving an Eighteen wheeler through the Pennsylvania wilds or on route eighty or an eye twenty through Dallas those those are the ones we want to hear please share with us a demonic experience doctor\nOkay sure so uh I was Eighteen years old living in my brother's garage I was at a very low point in my life\nAnd a sleeping on the mattress on the on the garage a floor and ah all of a sudden a this call them a fire appeared ah from the foot of the mattress or my feet were and and went in an arc over my head\nAnd so probably you know I don't know when six feet up in the air and in art and it was it was moving like a like a river of fire\nAnd there was this low guttural voice that was speaking in some kind of language I didn't understand and uh I I pinch myself I slap myself just to make sure I was awake and I was awake and this probably went on for about five minutes although it seems longer than that\nAnd it was it was terrifying and and I uh\nI got up and I I called my girlfriend and I told her what had happened and then she\nTold me to come over and she was quite worried about me she said come over in the morning and uh I did and then when I was there she told me well you should be we should call a psychiatrist and I said well just forget about it you know don't worry about it maybe it was just a dream but if it wasn't it was\nReal higher and I think you\nKnow I've yeah it was called them ... you know all of the fire and Gulf you while you were sleeping while you were in bed well\nIt was like a river of fire a column that went over my head in an arc shape it wasn't a engulfing he was over me\nYou know this is talk of Bruce all of so high now the reason I Want to Dr Bruce

there was a river of fire by your bed question about the river fire by your bed right before you saw that what were you doing or thinking did you do something to invoke the devil\nInside I don't believe so but I Do have a a theory about it because the day before actually the night before a I was a cutting through a yards like I usually do since I was a kid even when I was Eighteen years old they still did it jumped over fences and country are just as in Seattle\nSuburbs in Seattle and uh or north of Seattle and I cut through the yard of this a lady that the everybody all the kids cold or a witch\nAnd uh she had like blackberry Bush's they went all the way to the top of her roof and it was horrifying to you know the parents because it brought property values down but to us we just thought she was a witch\nAnd a ... I was cutting through a yard and it was night and I looked at her window and as I was cutting through yard and she was there with a candle\nThe witch and uh so I just I just cutting through a yard and it was night and I looked at her window and as I was cutting through yard and she was there with the candle and she had this she was very scary like and she had white hair that shot up in all directions she had a a candle she had this ulcer is cancerous thing on her nose and\nAnd uh she was just I felt like I was like a deer in headlights and I was I was just kind of frozen there for a moment until I could break free and I think I uh I I I think it has something to do with her\nBecause it happened the very next I think it was the very next night this thing happened so whatever I did\nI I must have really made her angry [noise]\nHave you had a paranormal story yourselves\nEight eight eight six eight eight W A L T we have Dr Bruce all of Seoul hot\nWho's Norwegian and would you agree Dr so high\nThe Norwegian men do not deserve Norwegian women [noise]\nAny time I've seen it or well Jim ... woman they're they're studying and gorgeous every time I see a Norwegian guys like a skinny wimp\nCouldn't see the person couldn't see their face but I could see a silhouette of a of a human figure bathed in light and they were holding my hands and they were holding the hands of hundreds of other people\nWhich in turn that off hundreds of other people\nAnd I realized I was an infinite circle\nI was holding hands with people bathed in white light and an infinite circle and I I didn't think things were going to be better but I knew everything was going to be different sterling on Sunday night\nOne of five point nine FM and am six thirty Washington Mall W.
