I was very into sexual is so\nThe reason I Do this is because the left is expert at using language there expert at using language to make ordinary things seem evil right so they will say something like racial profiling\nAnd single racial ask that racial profiling is bad you know unless they shut racial profiling police are doing it and they're you know there's all this trouble with the police\nTrouble with the police but think about this for many put a cop out on the street or even more you put a TSA agent\nAnd on a line changed got Fifteen to thirty seconds to judge whether you are

are Islamic [noise]\nHe's not being bigoted him not being bigoted the problem is that the nascent innocent Islamic guys being tarred by the bad guy\nBut the bad guy but that tennis age it has to make\nHis decision in a moment so racial profiling is a term they used to make that sound like it's evil when it isn't\nSo I'm putting out the left these dictionary to translate these terms in to ordinary English things that sound like they make sense from a laugh but maybe don't quite make so much that's what we're hoping we're going to try and put this together as a book in time for

for intersection analogy in ...\nI I as per intersection analogy\nIntersection now to use the theory that people can be understood intersecting social identity such as race gender class and sexual orientation it's only when the effect of all these interwoven identities is fully understood that a person knows how much he's allowed to blame is crappy light one right now\nBlaming runs crappy like one white men is called being oppressed dino crushed gives you the right to shop stupid stuff while wearing the pain pack it makes you look like a complete idiot [noise]\nThis is a good thing because it keeps you from having to take responsibility for yourself which can use up a lot of your social media site\nIf you don't have enough intersecting social identities and your designated as just some ... or a white man as a white man everything's your fall and you now have to work for a living to pay taxes to support intersection both they have more free time in which to blame for the crappy lives\nNow you may say well wait in America people aren't really oppressed very much and they can improve their lives by rising above the dysfunction in their communities in order to live productively\nUser called under the rules have been just sexuality people using facts are fascist and can be shouted down [noise] [noise]\nYou may say what if you shop people down and hit them with sticks and your the fashions that is called logic under the rules intersection out of the people using logical fascist it can be shouted down and hit with six [noise]\nSome people object to the underlying ideas of intersection Allen these people say that intersection alley is just a way of organizing Americans into random interest groups in order to turn them against one another so that left this to seize power\nBy pretending they're alleviating various forms of repression that don't actually exist\nThese people go on to say that each person's identity is unique God given\nThat wouldn't

unfairly\nStarted when I Won I said the good thing is now the press finally get now they'll finally treat me fairly they got worse and worse now than ever below do but that's okay I put up with it go ahead I use that word because of the fact that we made a deal with Mexico\n[laughter] I Love it there are other brothers logo I can say that because we made the deal was not long ago [laughter] we're gonna make [laughter] he's just thousands on the streets of all they want they don't want to talk about trade and the funny thing is Trump is all about trade this is one of his big big promises that he was going to rework\nThis stuff but they don't want to talk about trade all Kevin all the time just listen to how cool years talking about this they ask him about the FBI investigations to cut a strict\nThink the FBI should do what they have to do to get to the answer at the same time [noise]\nSame time [noise] just so we all understand\nThis is our seventh\nOf a man\nWho has really you know you look at his life until this happened what a what a change she's gone through what his family's gone through the trauma for a man\nThat never had any accusation any he's in a statement about him he's led I mean I think he was number one and the plastic yeah he was number one in this law school at Yale and then\nWhat he's gone through over the last three weeks his incredible so I Want the FBI

you know she's not always like this we have to admit this about I mean can get hot headed ... especially when he was attacked but he has just been\nHe just looks like she has got this in his pocket and he just says you know yeah the FBI let them do what they want and ... and so they try to shift in addition to the other thing they tried to shifted to drinking and that was absolutely hilarious and he then goes off on the people\nWho are asking for these investigations us ... number seven\nNow they talk about alcohol they talk about all of the things that you hear and frankly you take a look at that bringing a subject we wouldn't know about this over the last Twenty years Thirty years of his career you know what happened to go back to high school\nAnd they're saying she drank a lot of one evening and we you know I I happen to know some of the United states senators\nWho is on the other side who's pretty aggressive\nI've seen that person in very bad situations okay I've seen that person in very very bad situation somewhat compromising and you know\nUh I think it's very unfair to to bring up things like this however whatever the senators want is okay with me\nAll right we'll get right

I'm Sorry but people don't notice this because a lot of people don't like Trump and they don't notice the way he changes and when he adapts have always said he's a very adaptable guy he's a guy who learns on the job he said he would learn on the job and he has but that but that is incredibly this is like the new precedent absolute hysteria mowed the left\nAbsolutes hysteria mode Jeff Flake gets yelled out in an elevator he collapses\nTrump is like a ... I mean I I'm I'm Serious this is not\nNormal Trump I mean Trump is always a fighter he's always in their fighting I'm not saying that but he's not always just as confident\nAnd cool about the whole thing he does not seem like he has anything at risk and when they ask him for more time you know they're trying to delay this thing all they want the FBI thing is nonsense that whole reason when Trump was right when he said it's a blessing in disguise because it's called them out that's why they have to change their tune but when they ask for more time he has this great response was ... [noise]\nTell me about time Dianne Feinstein knew about this two months earlier if she wanted a really thorough investigation and all the time in the world she didn't have to wait until after the hearing was close essentially she should've said listen\nI have a problem\nThis reporter I'd like the FBI to look at it while we're doing the hearings we had two months no she didn't do that she waited 'til we were closed and then she probably leaked it but you know who am I to say but she probably did based on a very bad body language other day but\nMore importantly under sense for her to have waited that period of time and now for you Democrats and I guess I'm mentally new to the media right I consider you a part of the Democratic party but for you for the Democrats\nTo be talking about we want more time to the FBI if you wanted more time for the FBI why didn't Dianne Feinstein brings us up\nThat that is amazing just amazing stuff because you could see the reporters asking the question I didn't know who was was a way to a reporter asking the question when he said I just include you with the Democrats she looked like she kind of when it's going to ripple like aids struck are almost\nThe guy is in complete control in this press conference partly I'm sure it's because of the victory NAFTA which really does ... diem a lot of what a lot of the attacks are really ask there's a lot of the attacks on him but partly it has got to be because he feels he has got this thing ... and I just this is part of why I think\nThis Kavanaugh thing is collapsing they are not going to sell even the people on the left\nOr who are undecided they're not going to sell you that yeah we said the the rape somebody is not re when he was drinking I mean this is what they were there some yeah but he didn't stand near the punch bowl he was that you know he was standing with and he didn't get in a ski through some ice of the guy in college\nThey have conflated mixed up confused a philosophy with a gender with a group of people\nNobody is attacking women when you attack feminism would on attacking is the philosophy of feminism the philosophy that divides us into grievance organized mobs and that's what we're seeing we're seeing the degradation of the left by that organization that's exactly it\nThat's it for me if you'd like to hear more from me\nCan listen to the Andrew claiming show daily wire dot com sport on ice sheet I Hope you will drop by and we'll be back tomorrow on this is an says waivers killing their sense if you if\nYou were rich W.

Fifteen dead in Syria Steven the initial reaction in the Kremlin was\nExtremely belligerent and there were moments that there were it was looking as if the de confliction between Israel and Russia had failed there was eventually a phone call between the president of the prime minister however\nMy concern here is how the war party deals with this memory of the death of their comrades\n[noise] so let's get the context I have argued and I don't take you disagreed that for several years the new Cold War has developed\nAt least three bronze where Cold War could become hot war one is obviously you're in Ukraine everybody understands that there's a proxy work on the other is in the Baltic reaching\nA on be\nRussia's neighboring border with neighboring small Baltic states slapped the of the coin yeah stoning to a certain extent Poland when NATO is undergoing a very large\nAnd growing and permanent military buildup on Russia's borders and third day in Syria\nWhich I think we all understood but the lack of clarity of the danger there because you have\nSo many powers fighting in Syria but in particular with Russia and the United States Russia legally is in Syria the United states ... illegally but with Iran and Israel\nAnd turkey involve\nMe the global opportunities for something to go wrong and things have gone wrong before so they set up as you said the United states and Russia did this so called ...\nWhich means something like jeez let's try to avoid an accident and not treat each other down\nAn urban close calls but this the ... election mechanism\nAs war but I've always said to you you know today it works tomorrow it doesn't work\nIn Warsaw so remind uh our our folks lifting what happened on September seven teams [noise] Israel attack Iranian forces it's sad\nEnded up with the Syrians shooting down a Russian reconnaissance plane it was in a combat flag new connoisseurs play off Fifteen Russians to board the plane died [noise] um\nThe charge was and Israel really didn't deny this they maneuvered\nIn a way to put the Syrian planes chasing the rushing out the the Israeli planes behind this Russian plane they use the\nRussian plane as cover\nAnd it ... the Syrian shut down the Russian blind so as you say and this is where people who study Russia's reactions do more than just read the New York times you go to the source you look at what the Russians pay per se\nOr television or radio at what happened here is very interesting and it confirms the racist that I've stated on your broadcast for years but people have criticized that in the context of the Russian policy elite who only as a moderate\nKey moderate\nAnd the people more dovish to cope with ... took\nThe first reaction\nI guess was fascinating job was for ... to say it had been a terrible accident\nIn the fog of war\nSo kings on her way to disrupt\nThe reaction coots old ministry of defense was very angry\nThey rejected publicly some of its votes spokesman on radio or TV or the newspapers this explanation and they said Israel did it intentionally right\nThey said the Israeli shot the aircraft down that was not a fact but that was that I meant the angry statements in the first hours yes\nThey they just kept saying Israel I yes Israel is responsible and back who didn't want to do that why not first of all a if he had developed very very good relations with Israel\nRussia and cook with Yahoo and so what happened is that is neat and wants to apply to Moscow\nAnd basically even explained to putting her bag is look at this and ... says no you can't come\nJust a moment ... will continue I'm speaking with professor Stephen F Cohen we're reviewing the new Cold War and the alarming incidence of these last weeks I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nWashington comes to talk [noise]\n\nSummer's over but what I'm autumn made money for you when you were share won a thousand dollars four times each week this\nWell let's look at\nFirst of all this look at the political applications\nIt means now officially that Russia's will come to protect direct\nOf Syria correct\nCompletely correct politically it was a protectorate\nThat is to say ... representing Assad the president of Syria in world affairs now\nAssuming this has got to be a no fly zone you'll need Russia's permission to fly operation\nWhat must not happen is an American or Israeli airstrike killed a Russian that must not happen\nBut that's why I say we now moved to a new level\nAnd the dangers of the new Cold War while we're sorting out the ... that we've been distracted but this is really something new and important [noise] the second thing it tells you now is that if you weigh the geo political things in terms of victory and loss is\nI don't like to do it but there's no question that when ... entered Syria three just about exactly three years ago September two thousand this thing and everybody in the west side it would be a disaster and the Russians couldn't do anything\nWith from that moment\nBecause it was Russia that destroyed the Islamic state knock the United states in Syria\nNow becoming and remember Mrs Clinton had argued during the two thousand six team presidential election that she was president\nShe would declare a no fly zone over Syria so Russians couldn't fly there you can see how far potent and Russia have come on the world stage by this this act I mean I don't want to say it in a primitive way because of world politics is not a game but Russia's back in the biggest imaginable why\nIt's a very great world power no matter its problems at home and to the extent\nThat the United states now acknowledges that it will have to acknowledge that it needs Russia's permission to operate in Syria and sodas Israel that has a lot of political implications are kept me with an American president who can't have a phone call or two and\nWithout being called a traitor in this country so we got that's why the Russia gate complicates everything\nLet me just say one other thing and I'll get off of this\nI Want to move to Ukraine to stave go ahead I\nI've been amazed no I have not been amazed because demographically with all the Russians there I saw it decades ago coming but how warm and close Israeli in Russian relations have become over the years not just on the strategic level not just between ... yeah [laughter] but Israel\nThe minister of defense Lieberman is a Russian speaker a large parts of the electorate in Israel are ... not all of them are Jews they're Russians\nSome of them went to school together yeah\nOfficials in the Israeli government and Russian emigrated they went to school together they were in the young communist sleep together this is a bond that doesn't exist in the United states [noise]\nOh I think that what we're seeing here is in Israel slowly becoming as close to Russia as it's been to the United states over the years but in more human almost biological historical family ways and therefore the the close relationship between ...\nThe Yahoo over the last two three years reflective this now it's been disrupted maybe\nNow we've got you know Fifteen dead Russian airman and their families in\nPublic mourning in Russia so we will see what happens to the political relationship but this is a this is I wouldn't say it's a turning point but it's certainly a new situation and um\nIt would be great more than great his truck which like I I Would cooperate I Would like to point ... is a peace process underway that the United states where it seems just enjoy the best thing Trump do right now he joined the peace process process in Syria\nStay more than a year ago two years ago when Russia got involved in theory you said this would happen\nYou you can't you can't see the future haven't got a crystal ball but you said when you put militaries up against each other in a small space there will be accidents this is an accident\nAnd in the first twenty four hours it was a dangerous accident it might be defining now but there's no guarantee that it's not going to happen again so I mentioned that professor that when we talk about the escalation cycle it's inevitable we're not making it up it's happened before yes\nPost script or that or or teasing would agree with you what you just said is there are people there are people in all countries\nIn this case to who say it wasn't an accident\nBecause it was such profound accept that is Fifteen Russians died that people seem malice not acts and they say and the other country there are people plan this even if it isn't truth shot\nIt becomes bully and this as a new warfare dimension and that's just one of the three Cold War France\nAll right we're going to go to another one next we're going to ... a professor

very good evening to you on face value this looks like charitable conduct by Jeff Bezos\nHe at Christmas Time is seeking to raise minimum wage far beyond the seven and a quarter of seven and a half

before we get into the uh the the anecdotes about Amazon but evening to Michael\nLeaving John yes so economists call this raising rivals costs and the fact that Amazon is increasing it starting wage\nIs great for a workers and it's great for all low wage workers because it will put pressure on a target and Walmart and other big box retailers to continue raising their wages which they've been doing for the last few years as well but the fact that Amazon is going to lobby for a federal minimum wage increase\nIs the problem and that is what we're\nCalling us call it raising levels cost because\nRaising rivals cost because Amazon is more likely to be able to accommodate higher labor costs into its production strategy especially because of a rising automation and its ability to build more automation into its warehouses\nVan targets or Walmart code Walmart currently has over four times the number of employees a than Amazon and furthermore raising wage costs are going to hit mom and pop brick and mortar stores even harder than Wal Mart or target\nSo we shouldn't we could interpret this than as Amazon being aggressive in competition the way it's been aggressive in pricing the way

G. wells the world set free what does that\nThat is a novel that he\nWrote published in Nineteen fourteen\nAnd he describes the atomic bomb and he describes in very much like plutonium instead of naming it after Roman a God of the underworld or death he named it after one of his uh girlfriend's\nAh Carolinian but basically it describes plutonium he calls it the atomic bomb and it's a war that are ... to nuclear war\nThe reason the word atomic bomb the term atomic bomb enters into the end of the vocabulary is because two very famous physicist who been transported to America Leo ... and a Enrico found me one of them is read the novel which one\nUh that was so large he read it and then while crossing the street one day he was looking at a stop light and then thinking about the novel and that started and they mail a G going which are then he got in contact with time Stein and they wrote that famous letter to FDR\nA law and also knew that the Germans were or are starting to work on how to build a nuclear reactor and uh basically\n... novel the world set free is what started this whole ball rolling\nAnd so the term atomic bomb is from H.

Bob I remember you reported that some years ago I or maybe a year ago that they were starting space program and they're looking to encourage investors to come to ... exactly what we're witnessing now and I mentioned that this can be done in any country\nYou don't need a rocket to be part of the commercial space we go to U. A. E. which has another approach to draft an astronaut corps how they're doing by the\nWay she does it's an interesting way to compare the two last summer when he doesn't have a space program they just simply are trying to encourage investment dollars and let companies come and compete with everybody and invent new things in space\nWell what you a ... the United Arab Emirates is doing is they're copying the Soviet Union and the United states with space program and so they're trying to think they're trying to diversify the vice\nDiversify their ... their economy and bring in space\nThe development but rather than doing it the ... greatest space program that that they're going to try to fly a government\nBuilt a probe to Mars and they announced that they're going to fly a citizen to space and they made a deal with the Russians the Russians are going to fly amount of soy use craft\nAnd that astronaut is now going they've now set a tentative schedule is going to fly April fifth of next year and come back eleven days later to go to ...\nA fly on a so I use um\nUh they have not announced they have to find a list right now about who are that they've picked out of the applications that came from the citizenship they've announced who is going to have not said who is going to do it either way this is their by copying the space program Soviet style system that pretty much every country in the world has been\nFollowing for years and the U.S has finally transitioning away from a and Luxembourg and never wants\nSo we'll see how this works for them it is a sad thing from my mind I went to Russia or John\nTo fly this guy had the NASA and the bureaucrats in the United states slowed not slowed\nBasics down they could have possibly offered this flight to them in to them instead and important money to the U.S\nRussia and China the once upon a time wannabes dominating big space have not signed an agreement Bob this was part of the conversation we've had these last years Ross

of those ... and in doing something bold or making moves that given an opportunity to be fresh do you believe that this combination Russia and China will be successful\n[laughter] well I I I'll let me put it in another way or the reason that Russia and China this week signed an agreement to establish some greater cooperation that space projects and specifically has to do with the manufacturers space vehicles and rocket engines and I'm quoting exploring the moon and teach space\nIs one of the main things is focused at well gosh China is building its own space station\nWants to stay in space somehow and the choice it had up to now is to to team up with masses boondoggle gateway Luna a lunar space station\nAnd they've been complaints by regardless and the guy in charge of Ross cause mostly doesn't want to really deal with America's way these being dealt with as a as a as a as like a junior partner and so they're going to he's going to be meeting with a NASA Administrator Jim Britain and sign on October tenth\nAnd I think these negotiations are part of the Russians very skillful negotiation tactics\nThey're telling the United states and Nassar essentially that if they don't get a good deal and working with gateway they'll switch to the Chinese and the truth of the matter\nIs he's probably looking at gateway from a technical perspective and thinking you know she really isn't going to serve us very well while the Chinese are building a space station maybe we can team up with them and put new modules on their station\nIt'd be easier and less of a costly and\nPossibly more practical so this is a perfect example of that what I Will tell you here is that um the NASA has trouble building anything they can do that costs to just takes too much money and time and so they get far income countries to come in here and build parts for them\nI'm much of the fence was built by Russia and Europe and Japan or when it comes to get with the same kind of thing or Ryan they couldn't build a service module for that capsule Orion the advocate Europe to do it\nAnd so that desperate to get partners in the gateway Luna orbiting station\nAnd the Russians couldn't a threatened to pull out I expect massive ... management to actually back stab the U.S in any negotiations with Russia they'd rather than defend us interest I expect them to be focusing on trying to guarantee Russia participation even if the deal might\nCripple American burgeoning American burgeoning private American space industry and I really touching that happened in the past that happened with diet thefts and I really expect to see it again here Russia is playing a good heart ball game that's where I Would tell you\nI Would warn the Russians that the Chinese will steal everything including your play do so do not leave anything on attended a Bob the rush of the Chinese just deal that's like you know\nThey do with the kind of remember that the space station and their cats so\nEvery man's carry my man freight is it's all based on Russian designs that are\nBased on staff and if they get into Ross cause most they'll reproduce it now the Chinese are doing small ... is that a positive\nUh well it's always about it from a from a space exploration prevent a point of view down the road and they're having more innovation and more ideas but another one of their claim to be private companies called X space\nLaunched last week a small sect into orbit using a solid fuel rocket I'm\nThis is the third of these companies launching small ... ex faces this one one faces another and I space is the third and they're all using solid rockets to put up law small small ... and they're all very closely doing work for the Chinese\n... solid rock hard Chinese military I don't think so they're all military everywhere I think\nAbsolutely right that the the the military here though is using um Chinese New way of allowing\nPrivate investment fought in its so called independently run companies to build these for them but there's no doubt they are wholly owned and controlled by the military of the Chinese government there's no doubt in my mind about that I Would like to pack up the one thing you said about the Russian stealing from the Chinese or the Chinese\nTo Russia to rush the Chinese\nAre not going to steal much from the Russians anymore because they've done it all the Chinese have far better

Roman Catholics right\nCivil rights away if you're from unorthodox point of view than uh the the uh the third heretic the yeah the Catholic or a a a deadly western enemy and when I came across a picture of the person who are trying to not know what he was he just seemed to be a picture of a ... with multiple heads\nWhen you read ... if you look at it you see that it's um amongst it with something that's in the way they've created Germany and Austria\nIs um they've taken the individual men mistake like cooking the very the kings fax me and made each your head\nI'm the one to get to the magic number seven I mean there are the reason for that it's very simple because they've read that book of revelation they know that one of the signs of the apocalypse one of the signs all the end times\nWill be the eyes of this great setting headed cracking on the Russians are saying well here it is it's in the central part was it in Germany and Austria\nAnd no matter what of vitamins we have to do to geography we're going to turn Germany Austria it to a certain headed a beef stew civilian urges all the ah ah the devil the beast or a pervasive through the wall\nAnd there's a conflict that is a is every chapter of Phillips' book which is that if this is the fight between Christian nations yes the caliphate is at the edge but it's chiefly\nProtestant versus Catholic versus Catholic versus orthodox and they struggle sell up what I learned from you everyone was confused by how it is they can define the other guy as the anti Christ right\n[noise] right so the only way Christians contract Christians in that way\nIs if they can present the enemy as being less than a Christian or anti Christian so one country have to look at another one I think well they may appear to be Christian but in fact they are so evil they're so bad\nThat got proved how hypocritical they are on the ... that even contributes to ah make them even more\nA more diabetic so if you consider another Christian denomination that's good if you can say that they're doing some very bad by a lung with known Christians and that's ... that's very powerful but the ... school is the enemy may seem to be Christian but in fact that not just anti Christian with us well they they are anti\nCrime let their in large a turn to how they proved the Germans were wrong right away from Catholic France's point of view the grades and holy war Philip Jenkins is the author I'm John bachelor [noise]\nWant to like one on one\n[noise] this is what's going on I don't want to come online\nWell no I think the attorney general could prosecute them but I think what becomes clear when you when you read about that allegation is the same\nOld tired old problem with trying to police this this drug trafficking which is that they make a lot of money in this business and what do they use that money for they buy weapons they recruit soldiers\nAnd they corrupt and bribe a law enforcement and institutions inside the country Colombia's courts are very much corrupted by drug money\nAnd this is just an example I mean the the special piece court was supposed to be you know the one where would interview them and find out what their crimes were and write them all down and this was going to be a way to sort of have a cleansing a spiritual cleansing of the country because everything\nCountry because everything would be out in the open and the criminals would have confessed\nBut it turns out that there's already corruption inside the Peace Corps they're officials inside the peace court that have been cooking up a false ... Martinez described it and and fraudulent testimony in order to help\nFor you know the FARC members basically escape and and and go off and do whatever they want to do so the court is corrupted\nAnd you know he says that he is going to prosecute this particular um series of people that he caught if the court can be corrupted like that it will be corrupted again and again and again it will be very hard to keep up with it\nAnd you know one of my big problems with this court in general is that why should you have a parallel court system why shouldn't you say to somebody if you kill somebody over there you have to go to jail for Fifteen Years\nBut if you're a card carrying member of the FARC and you killed somebody or you killed five people all you have to do is come and tell us and you get to go free creating a parallel and justice system is fraught with problems\nAnd on now you have another layer of problems on top of that which is the parent corruption of the court\nThe report you have from the southern district of New York seems important here Mary because we care about the US's participation over the years in solving Colombia's prices you\nReport that two members of the FARC who were due to take seats in Congress are no part of an accusation by in New York in the southern district of New York\nFor conspiring to import tons and tons of cocaine do some Greek\nAnd Marlin marine

know I laugh when you say that because there were so many red flags before this thing was signed but the Obama administration John Kerry Bernie ... ... and we're all you know just bent on\nBernie errands and was the representative is that who doesn't\nWho doesn't speak Spanish I mean who knows what he was doing sit around Nevada I don't know [laughter] but um you know that this was all very apparent but they were bent on having this because they thought that it would be a legacy item just like opening\nTons of cocaine as a legacy item I well\nNow you're touching on what the ... you said you know our our is the U.S now aware of this what the us away is aware of is that the area of of ah Columbia that is used for cocoa crawling and the increase in a cocaine production has shot up\nAnd you know now or as I said in my column I mean in many ways we're starting over again a president ...\nHad basically pacify many of the rural regions of the country because he he returned the presence of the state to those areas\nPresident Santos pulled back from that he he basically gave an olive branch to you know all these different criminal groups while he was having this negotiation and have at it and he basically told them you know what we're not going to hold anybody accountable so what do you think the consequences of that are going to be people are going to say well crime pace\nAnd why why should I be sitting here earning minimum wage when I can be good could be in this business and the other thing is that you know if you get these old guys who were the um you know you you mentioned the two that are we were looking\nFor recon marine but the nephew of market right exactly and\nHe's disappeared these older guys you know they have all the money they want that's backed away and you know offshore bank accounts and so forth so they're all said\nAnd what they want to do is come in from the cold and be able to put their feet up and act like politicians with this money\nBut you can bet that there are a whole bunch of you know sort of mid level managers and this business who are going to say hey wait a minute I could be the next couple\nAnd that's why so many of these guys are returning because the money is in the cocaine\nAnd in the little businesses and to think that you're going to sit down in Nevada also those did really\nWas carve out an amnesty for these old guys who have enough money and are kind of tired of the foot rod and the jungle and want to come in and he didn't do anything about it actually changing the dynamics of what makes the FARC of violent\nOr you know a drug trafficking organization\nKerry a President Santos Bernard errands Brock Obama have any of them commented on this district ...\nThe southern district of New York issue or the fact that the violence is increasing in Colombia or the fact is that the Havana negotiation in twenty sixteen is now demonstrated to be in tatters have they commented marry\nWell not to my knowledge I mean I Know that those said publicly that if these guys had violated that they um their pledge not to being cocaine trafficking\nAfter November two thousand six pain that yes they should be um arrested and I think he was even in favor of the extradition\nUm but other than that basically apologist for the FARC agreement are saying well the problem is the government because the
