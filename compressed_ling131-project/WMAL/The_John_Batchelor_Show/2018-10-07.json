senior fellow on a at a consumer policy expert\nAnd I'd love to hear from you on this mission because I keep hearing that there's science that shows that even the smallest amount of secondhand smoke even in our well ventilated places hazardous to someone tell\nThat doesn't seem logical to me in the show\nI mean technically that's true a small amount of a lot of things to have a ... law harm to you I mean even water dangerous if you drink enough of it in in toxicology we like to say that does make a poison just saying that someone to risk it increased by something that didn't really say much unless you know how much the risk goes up and when it comes to second hand smoke\nScientists actually you know in the last Thirty years just that would become pretty clear that the scared about second hand smoke was way overblown\nAnd yet and I've been looking at those studies I got a whole list of them a year that I've been looking at in the journal of National Cancer Institute of all places hardly a a pro smoking journal\nBut none of these laws that have been banning our behavior with regard to tobacco but none of them have been rolled back if anything they're doubling down\nBecause it

I was a big ah contracted by constituents who thought that it should be and the rest of the county and we now have will have a history of what has happened in those two municipalities\nOkay but well hold on you just said that this is a public health issue um so I think I Would think that some scientific studies suggesting that\nThat the second hand smoke and outdoor settings as hazardous to your health would be relevant here and I'm looking at the journal of National Cancer Institute twenty Thirteen says there's no clear link between passive smoking and lung cancer I'm looking at the journal community health twenty twelve said that a heart attacks and\nA state wide smoking bans are not linked at all I'm looking at the medical care research in review actually one of the authors Claudia Steiner is from Rockville that's one of your constituents she set a nationwide assessment of the association of smoking bans in cigarette taxes they connected to hospitalization says that there's no connection to the science actually goes against the idea that you're\nHelping I disagree with you OK hum I can tell you that when we went through this for inside the restaurants\nThere were plenty of people from my memory I don't have their names in front of me I didn't know that you wanted to go to have this type of ... the discussion for this and on this topic but there were plenty of people who were scientists to disagree with those studies\nWell no I I recognize that in fact that's why I raised all of the studies that I just raised because the summer from twenty twelve what no I understand that because a lot of studies since then have now debunked a whole lot of this study is that we're used to justify bans on a public smoking in fact not only\nThat but if it's not it's not against public you believe it's it's fine to have second hand smoke\nUh well actually I Believe what scientists some studies telling me Arthur Kaplan who is a professor at the NYU school of medicine just wrote in time magazine a couple of years ago that anti smoking advocates are misusing science and especially and so\nCan you have you looked for anybody that is that is is that it said we're the opposite stand that this is your viewpoint but if you look for others that have said the opposite\nOh sure of course there are studies out there that they just do not want this to me to please well actually what I'm doing is trying to challenge your position because you are the one who was trying to pass a law and actually received very close race very clear\nThis was going to public hearing and anyone that has information from either side on this issue can certainly bring it\nForward it by would think though that you would have the science to back up your ban on ... where you actually present the law I mean you're the one who authored that you present\nIt I did and I and the author what we did today to be very clear is introduced this to go to public hearing we introduced to both from the legislative side and from the board of health side\nSo I guess just logically speaking I mean I understand if you're on an airplane and somebody's smoking that air gets recycled that you know I I get it that that smoke that smoking should be banned but in an outdoor setting it doesn't it just logically go to reason\nThat we said you wanted to talk about the science and and\nThere I I already started wanting to talk about the science but you're the one who didn't because you don't have it in an hour ... willing to talk about it all oh All right so what scientific study do you have that that that will be part of the public hearing but okay so let's talk now then let's talk this logic beginning though\nEvery time I tried to bring it up you say will have it at the public hearing so I'm Jane we well and I hope you would appreciate them back and listen I'm One of your constituents I live right over by playing rose I'm looking to looking forward to seeing it\nBut just logically speaking if you're out of doors and somebody lights up next to you I mean what kind of toxic effect is that going to have on your life I mean realistically speaking\nWell there again a furious from an individual standpoint in my opinion\nIf if I'm sitting at an outdoor restaurant in the outdoor restaurant area I mean if someone is walking pace and smoking this does not affect that this would have this would have an effect on the people sitting in an outdoor restaurant in many cases it's on the sidewalk or an outdoor area\nThat that um that smoke when the when either changes or blows in your in your in your face or a or in your area\nDoes have an effect on I can I can certainly tell that the smoke is there\nFor yeah although I mean I can tell when somebody next to me where it's too much cologne that doesn't mean it's a ... [laughter] oh I can oh my gosh maybe we might not go to the fact is I guess they're wearing that about ... let me as if we're if somebody has a smoker and uh where where is the appropriate place for them to smoke\nWell there again they can certainly smoke is they're walking not in this\nAnd he was a smoker and ... where where is the appropriate place for them to smoke\nWell there again they can certainly smoke as they're walking not in not in a seat at area which is disturbing area of of all of a restaurant they can't do it inside a restaurant now\n... and ... suggesting that that it go to consideration that they should not do it outside the restaurant but someone that's walking down the street it's it's certainly legal to do that and I'm not suggesting otherwise\nYou're listening to them that although leery O'Connor's show [noise]\nOn fire during this having\nOn news cycle Michel Martin the host Michel Martin investigators on the TV Michele Bachmann in your career one of the things that you have focused on quite a bit is of innocent people being wrongly accused of crime\nSpecifically ah well not just specifically but you often end up focusing on people who are accused of crimes related to sex so my God when you see what has transpired over the last week I'd love for your reflections on this\nWhile it's really a a manifestation of the radical feminist needs to bandwagon and a lot of being believe all women propaganda that really metastasize\nAnd in the college campus setting and unfortunately or has seeped into law schools and I'm certainly newsrooms as well and so the entire trajectory of this have an author ... completely predictable\nI'm also appalled at um what I have seen as being on preparedness of the Senate Republicans to deal with the social justice mob so we'll we'll see what it's going to happen tomorrow Larry's out I'm holding my breath\nYou know when we last spoke we both agreed on a pretty basic send them as this isn't about women being believe or men being believe it's about evidence being bullied so now that we've gotten the evidence in the form of testimony and then other reports that we've seen that have come in that sort of called some of the testimony and the question\nIs is there even a ... uh well I don't see shuttle of doubt but it's not even a close call at this point when I look at this\nUh Michelle ... is there any doubt that senators are seeing the same evidence and coming to a different conclusion unless it's for political purposes [noise]\nWell I mean here we just have had um Chuck Grassley and Christine for a lawyer the Democrat operatives feminist Deborah cat\nUm engage in in this cat and mouse game where a Denver cats is refusing to hand over actual evidence which would be the the therapist notes and I'm more information about the polygraph\nAnd that the the cats\nUm lawyer is refusing to to give it to anyone except for the FBI and we already know that that is a whole kabuki charade um because whatever the FBI gonna come out with nobody is going to believe [noise]\nUm so I I I I don't know what's going to happen the chicken only with Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski and I'm senator Collins I mean that's what I I I've always been nervous\nAbout uh that\nConstellation and the Senate Republican universe and I'm more nervous about them than I ever happen\nWhat what do you think of how the White House has been handling this and certainly over the last uh two twenty four hours a President Trump got quite aggressive last night in in calling out\nUh what he's the what we all saw as the inconsistencies and Dr forwards testimony and then there are going to be Sanders absolutely back to the president today was an incredible performance in the press room are they on the offensive and should they be on the offensive [noise]\nWell I'm Glad to see it and I understand that there are a lot of hand ringers on in the beltway on to talk of the core appalled to see\nA President Trump as aggressive as he was but he didn't say anything that I agreed with last night\nAnd I certainly you can call as the never Trump um orbit always well about the tone and the timing of but I but\nI think it's about them time that we talked about exactly these kinds of things because I didn't want him to a veteran or expert ah actual expert within the criminal justice system that you have to ask these questions you have to highlight each inconsistencies\nAnd memory gaffe an into ticket like that in a a video for your keys either way\nI looked at the absolute dissonance between Christine Blasey Ford behavior during the hearings Merced it her actual record as an academic with a a very I'm ... now\nSpecial tea and statistics that data and I'm not sure I'm In the piece that I'm married to a health

are obsessed\nWith the tail so the idea that you couldn't even remember ... therapists now to the Washington Post you throw strains credulity\nYeah you're so right Michel ... but you know you so often write and speak eloquently about what\nHappens outside of Washington DC and and as our late dear friend Andrew Breitbart used to say you know politics is of course downstream of those other institutions the media entertainment pop culture and academia on this topic with regard to how the entertainment world is going to cover it and and\nHave it be ingrained in their storylines for years to come and and what's going to happen on college campuses with the abusive title nine has this ship already sailed now sadly it are they going to take this Kevin thing and sort of up and the way our our country is setting aside the Supreme Court\nWell have perfected that witch hunt process where ... title nine Shan hearings and we have that you give us your partner factory actually ... terrain that in in terms of the culture you're absolutely right\nWary and of course and you but partly also right about that which is something that has been nurtured and TV movie storylines for years and decades now\nAnd the idea in in rhetoric pop culture political culture that you should never question and a curator at something that is now in that it and and that's why there's such a violent reaction I think\nOur primary towns Connor yesterday but if we could she asked the kinds of accusations too you know a credible search for truth why do we even have a criminal justice system\nYeah

[noise] I don't\nThe first person to say I want to hear from Dr for [noise] I thought she was handled respect\nThough Kavanaugh was treated like\nThe first person to say I want to hear from Dr for [noise] I thought she was handled respects [noise]\n... [noise]\nYeah homo yourself\n[laughter] oh\nI was thinking of the folks who uh stepped up in a surprise visit wake Lindsey Graham at the Atlantic given in D.C on Wednesday we'll blow yourself after he is funny because here you had Cory Booker ... and and he told us he was having his Spartacus moment\nAnd then Lindsey Graham like actually wants to give up the hearing and he's continued it's kinda like Lindsey Graham's like the Grinch and a difference and you know the Grinch is hard grew three ... three times a day at let's say that a Lindsey Graham's intestinal fortitude grew three times\nOver the past three months I Believe and so he's become a new hero in this entire process rock solid Lindsey Graham something else that I don't think many of us necessarily thought would be the case\n... I Am very much based on information on the arguments the information I provide new my opinions all based on information and one of the things I've been tracking from the word go the day after Brett Kavanaugh was nominated to the United States Supreme court\nGallup has always tracked on Supreme Court nominees and you you may be a bit whatever about Gallup but regardless of what you think of their polling it's instructive because if they do it every single day ongoing you can use a baseline to get a temperature ... temperature jak of public opinion on any given issue in this case\nOur views of Brett Kavanaugh\nWhat was interesting and the very first polling done\nOn Brett Kavanaugh after his nomination by President Trump we had four percent more Americans say that he should be confirmed and not okay so that's the baseline that's where we started now after we had the first hearing\nAnd we had twenty senators on the Senate Judiciary committee and Spartacus\nDo what they did coming out of that\nFour percent more Americans thought that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed and not in other words despite the fact that a couple of months went by despite the fact that they uh you know ... is on them\nIt didn't change public opinion at all not at all now is interesting because\nAs consistent as that was we did see with Christine forwards allegations a bit of a shift\nAs a Thursday morning not yesterday but a week ago the morning of the hearing we did see public sentiment according to Gallup shift into negative territory I'm Brett Kavanaugh\nWe saw public sentiment shift to three percent more people believing that he should not be confirmed then should be getting prior to the testimony alright that's after everything that the media and the politicians did the Brett Kavanaugh\nWhere are we today I've kind of interesting by a forty six forty five margin\nAmericans believe that Brett Kavanaugh should be confirmed now they're too soon to be learned in this entire process on this information to first is public opinion despite all the emotions all the emotions the all the nonsense for sport it gets to Christine for two gang raping\nWhatever public opinion only shifted by seven percent seven percent top to bottom that's it in terms of the opinion about that\nNow what's instructive inside of that seven percent we bounce back to pretty much where this country is one of the things I find fascinating is when we actually do have representatives in this country that represent us and in this particular case the United States Senate\nIs doing pretty much what the American people want to have happen here\nBy a slim margin Brett Kavanaugh\nEnded up receiving the necessary votes to advance the final vote tomorrow and we'll end up becoming the next Supreme Court justice on a narrow vote just as the American people wanted it so that part I think is so I could graphically interesting\nThe next facet of this conversation is where to focus your energy\nBecause how many people are really persuadable politically one of the most common questions I ever receive has to do with persuading people politically how do you do it\nWell the easiest way to tell you how not to do it who is it that you are most likely to engage politically\nProbably the loudest people in your life that oppose you right how's that work out for you\nTo gauge politically probably do al as people in your life that oppose you right\nHow's that work out for you and let me ask you for the angry leftist but you argue politics with you ever get anywhere you get angry [noise] do you think there want to be\nFolks just poured that seven percent that was ever persuadable and the first place [noise]\nI Know we wish that we could change their minds especially if they're in our lives and our universe\nPeople have to be open minded first\nComing up next to talk about that and how to be persuasive and who can be persuaded and how not to bend your head against the wall and become really unhappy I Am Brian mug\nA lot of folks have given up on the millennial generation which by the way the youngest millennials are I'd closing in on being a legal to drink the youngest one's ...\nOne's like thirty five thirty six now and I have not blame them ride along because when was it that they came of age they came of age and the great recession right so here they went through the education establishment they were fed a bill of whatever the education establishment feeds them\nAnd then they come out and the economy's terrible\nAnd they weren't able to get opportunity and so it made sense to them yeah you know what capitalism this economy doesn't work we need change you know Obama probably made sense because hey that was what our teachers told us in here we are and things are working\nThey had never seen a good economy never seen a good economy we finally have it right now is one of the most important window of time\nWe have two really good opportunities to reach people\nEspecially younger adults that now do have opportunities three point seven percent unemployment are you kidding me Frank Barry getting the wage growth the bonuses it's all happening and it's important to tell them how we got here\nAnd then it's also important in this ... situation to articulate what's on the line here hey if somebody that you didn't even know came out and accused you of the sexual assault may not be awful right\nYeah it'd be pretty bad right I mean that's what happened here and and go through information only rather than just the emotions of yeah you know Kevin all anyway just a little food for thought let's go to Archie in Ventura, California Archie go\nRight and it's it's good to hear about your ah your history and and your experience are totally why mark what attracts you to do is show\nThe three of you and I wanted to say that ah I live in a very carefully to the suit was a a a a colon senator Collins is a [noise] a death or taken about what happened and even though I'm a Democrat and I'm In California I was a quite impressed by it\nShe laid it out very precisely [laughter] he was a very methodical started out a little weak but it went on from there and be able to\nSee what would you do or do I get all the time [laughter] than getting a\nLink to her a conclusion with all the interviews he did and all the meetings he went to Israel I found it very edit flying and informative and uh her stock went up ... percent with me [noise]\nI couldn't agree more I was frankly shocked at just how detailed top to bottom on every single consideration that's part of this process\nI mean she was on ... ... and point\nBy point by point from the nomination process pointing out how many organizations were going to oppose\nRegardless of who the nominee was that one of the organizations hadn't even filled in the name and they put out that they were opposing the nominee mentioned or that even senators got out ahead one of them even got out ahead of the name being announced when they were saying that they were opposed\nAll the way through point by point by point\nWind Christine Ford was not credible in terms of her allegations even though she did mention that she believed that ultimately she was likely a sexual assault victims no evidence whatsoever that it was Brett Kavanaugh and her eyes she could have been\nThe top attorney in the country the way that she laid out the details as she found them\nIt was about Fifteen minutes fifty fifty five minutes her speech and I would say that it is a must view if you missed it uh it is definitely worth catching the entire thing it was captivating and again I have never heard\nA senator deliver better speech not ever I didn't agree with absolutely everything she said but it was principles it was details it was well thought out and almost everything there is inarguable I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins\nWouldn't go Saddam I go to Jim\nArguable I just absolutely remarkable Susan Collins and goes a dynamite go to Jim Jim in Charlotte welcome to the show\nEverybody thanks so it's harder to pretty much echo what the last caller showed up about a murder suspect there at ... percent of the callers I mean it's increased by ... fold afterwards gr ogre for about ... minutes after that I knew her vote was going to be a sticker driving down the road that\nYou know the only other thing bigger than what Susan calls and food are today was when the twenty of Maine Josh what Chamberlain protected the flank of the army Gettysburg little round top costs preserving the junior so I really admire her and I'm Glad she did what you did\nWell that's a pretty big moment in history and I I agree that this is one for the history books as well by the way a how are the folks in North Carolina do and you guys are making the back\n[noise] oh yeah yeah the skaters are kind of a ramp butter and big but a a sort of cold weather gets in on her a picture I think they should be like diminishing a little bit\nOut of the folks over in Wilmington Robert\nCharlotte but uh I was in the marine Corp Grover that they're even know ever read was pretty good they're recovering pretty good but Jacksonville or your real areas there all the water retreated and the cover of area so I talked to a friend over there everything's everything's back hope for slowly but surely Becker normal\nAnd appreciate your service thank you for listening to and sharing your thoughts as well and may God Bless you know the folks there I Lived in Wilmington for a very short time and when I saw what was going on and heard that it was an island a pretty unimaginable I was so glad that a folk starting to get back together\nAfter the hurricane in North Carolina All right let's go to Jake Jake than California Welcome to the show\nA a a yeah I was a I Would agree with your point about work it up to the board and as far as er allegations that concern but I had a little different take on a not so much to go after her but to ah go after anybody in the future\nThat might think that they could set people up to put a a false allegations and not have to pay a price\nCorrect I think that's the single most important thing and the reason why I'm not willing to just give a past even though Kavanaugh is going to clear this thing\nBecause he's always going to have this thing that he's going to have to deal with there's a certain percentage of the population that is not insignificant but it's going to believe the allegation regardless and it's not okay to perjure yourself these are principles and again you know if we're going to deal with the rule of law for going to deal with the premise\nThat should be addressed and we know because of politics we're not going to see the Senate Judiciary committee pursue her for perjury and conduct investigation that would be necessary to travel down that path\nBut it doesn't mean that it should go unchecked what she did was absolutely wrong because again when you say you I'm One hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted me and you have none of your uh none of your witness a\nWere none of the witnesses period that cooperate any of that information I mean that's a problem that's not acceptable in this country appreciate you are you listening in and check and then coming up we'll continue the conversation and also share some of\nMy final thoughts on bread cabin on the situation as we get ready for the vote are now under a day away will be approximately five o'clock\nEastern time tomorrow because once again

L\nWashington coming to talk\n\nI mean who doesn't want to be a part of that movement is all I'm saying and gone\nAnd those are the the kind of people that you want to be spending some quality time with a man what your doubts having a life today that was going on the uh paid protesters there a\nHeckling and harassing Joe Manchin who is that yes Joe Manchin the Republican and waiting wonder if

and waiting wonder if that is going to happen to have no idea but Joe Manchin of course has been the most moderate Democrat in the Senate mentioned after the twenty sixteen election but he wouldn't consider consider the party but\nThe governor the Democratic governor of West Virginia ... to the question is is mansion next maybe he wins reelection here and and he goes ahead and and does the ... thing but uh so I was mentioning in the previous segment\nThat there's the potential that we could be an inflection point in American history one in which the norms don't apply Donald Trump being president of the United states not your typical president and the movement that he learned twenty six same not your typical movement which has happened with Brett Kavanaugh\nThat could certainly aid the argument that we're in this inflection point that things are different business not your typical midterm election cycle to provide a a little more\nFuel for that fire if you want to embrace it\nSomeday and I've never seen and again I'm a student of history and I'm a student of information and to the point age began in the Nineteen thirties so we have information about what we've been interested in what we've been into the midterm elections since the late Nineteen thirties right\nNever once not ever has the most important issue to the average voter ... in the United States Supreme court it's come up with really high and presidential elections it was the number three issue on election day there were three issue and election day twenty six thing\nBut it's number one number one right now\nAccording to the Pew Research center Seventy six percent of Americans say that the Supreme Court will be on their mind when they go to vote\nHowever their impassioned to vote\nNow we are still just over a month away from election day\nPeople are fickle things can change cabinet gets confirmed tomorrow maybe the level of priority comes down because it's been taken off the table I guess we can say or maybe if people are still ... motivated by because hey we could have others Supreme Court justices that come up your over the next couple of years right\nThat remains to be saying\nBut we are seeing right now and some of the internal data that's available\nWhat's driving us that's different than ever before you have the Supreme Court and management and then it goes to health care OK so after that a which by the way does that change the dynamic at all\nSo we're in this window of time that is different and anytime that politics that people are different the outcomes absolutely have the potential to be too so as we are now just over a month away from election day\nYou take a look at how many elections are out there\nThat could have the outcomes changed by seven percent seven percent\nAnd that is the potential for what could happen if there were a red wave that came out of this\nRight now\nIf you had seven percent that moved because of President Trump because of the economy because of the progress for me because they are tired of what's going on in this country because of backlash about Brett Kavanaugh eagle wind seven percent\nIn the first hour I mentioned that in this entire cabinet process entire process from the day after he was nominated until today\nSeven percent movement top to bottom in terms of public opinion on whether or not we should confirm Brett Kavanaugh bet that is really what we're looking at here those are the people that are persuadable but seven percent\nEncompasses a bunch of elections across this country usually voter enthusiasm is exaggerated because only sixty four percent of eligible adults or even registered to vote in the first place and what you take a mid term elections well I mean typically have around forty percent they actually show up to vote\nSo we do tend to often bake a bit too much into voter enthusiasm this and that\nBut it absolutely has the potential in this type of environment to make the difference which is why it's absolutely critical you want to make a difference you get your butt out there and vote like you find those seven percent\nYou use this potential inflection point in American history and you get out there and you're trying to make a difference because we do have a different landscape it's not all they are and the point in the top level numbers that are discussed yet\nBut it has the potential to be and we're a little more than a month away so that\nIs what you were in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined\nPotential debate and we're a little more than a month away so that is what you're in store for you get out there make a difference if you're inclined unlike those\nAngry people that were a paid and and shouting that Joe Manchin it's going to win the hearts and minds at least I don't think it's going to winning hearts and minds there is this window of opportunity a moment in time potential inflection point issues that matter more that never met her before in mid term election cycles so what are you going to do with it\nAnd uh by the way I Want to give you a heads up on something that uh you definitely definitely should go ahead and ...

conversation get some of your thoughts as well as as an inflection point by mud and for the great one Marshall that\nBut then she walked back those comments later in the afternoon after she started getting some of the response in so\nUh she'll be an interesting one to watch tomorrow although we should the likely be a formality which gives recovered by the way because you can go ahead and you're Lisa Murkowski in and vote in the affirmative because it's like an ultra the outcome almost certainly tomorrow All right let's go to Dan Dan is in Clearwater, Florida Dan welcome to the show\nHey thank you sir [noise] hey I'm I was watching and listening to a center calling speech today and at first I was I was stunned I was amazed I was impressed and ... her speech I started going\nThis is damage control and I started going wow I mean the American public and importantly to the Democrats the independents are getting angry\nAnd they need to lessen the damage and they were in damage control things less than the damage to that that's what I saw I think it actually hurts her speech was scripted she did not speak like the protests was written\nSo I don't think that that was genuine I I think that they were really running damage control and trying to you know take the anger directed that they write truthfully have towards them and less of that [noise]\n... where I Can't necessarily get along with that ... the level of detail starting from the very moment\nOr that she depicted what happened at the time of the nomination\n... detailed and chronicled at every everything that she thought way in a foul and I don't know that she would have\nHad that level of detail if she were just trying to rally here in the eleventh hour to try to save face for the moderates in the Senate\nI got this and so what took place today was truly principal and and really was something that she was that series about every step of the way in and throughout the process including as you pointed out with all her other previous votes so\nI I hear what you're saying but I'm just not in on the conspiracy thought process that Susan Collins it was not on the up and up I I really got the sense that uh she was in the air and genuine throughout her speech\nLet's go to Raj Raj is in Virginia Welcome to the show\nA little tank to so much I Do appreciate your very strong emphasis on fixing points I Believe the on that point but not just in the political lady now given an accident you know even the heck is he now\nThat they came to the culture is increasing and those are all the trends and I'm looking at a strong red rain [noise]\nOr the other point two men can vote on doing more to put up political system it has to do with what's happening locally in D.C to people to know that ... to ... seats\nTo behave by two opposing party to both have to be the public and [noise] and that's why that's not seats in the DC conflicts of sway important so thank you very much for that too [laughter] and I had to leave it to you\nI'm guessing the year as big of a dark as I Am are you an analyst\n[laughter] prior hurt been an engineer or my like\nOkay I had a feeling that it was somebody who was a ... a similar type of thought process anyway I Am not an engineer though not that long shot I came and changes dire effect the boy just asked my dad about a [laughter]\nThat was one of the moments where I ... my background is in financial analysis and business outside of radio I've been doing this Twenty one years love when I Do uh but uh but the yeah you gotta work spiritual paths that way and what I end up ended up doing is taking Financial Analytics in various different algorithms and in formulas\nAnd figuring out that hey we have history we have an information we can do a lot of different things in in life\nPolitical and berries different algorithms and in formulas and figuring out that hey we have history we have the information we can do a lot of different things in in life with them a beyond just the financial markets for example so anyway ah good stuff pretty she had Raj let's go to Phil Phil is in Vegas welcome to the show\n[noise] good afternoon you have the two things that that I took away from that when I was watching everything this whole whole process with my wife the first thing when we saw the doctor giving her testimony we felt sorry for we really felt that she was emotionally disturbed\nAnd there we thought that was probably a whole plethora of reasons for that you know obviously saw sexual molestation by that one\nBut we felt pity we didn't feel angry I have no animals towards the woman but I think the biggest takeaway on this was the debauchery\nThat to the Democrats ex expose themselves to the process that they would go to to\nPrevent something that was normal within you know the process of the government and there should be some re ... parents from these attorneys who were directed to her by Dianne Feinstein who had animals towards President Trump\nAnd hid things from her like her being able to be interviewed in California or wherever she wanted\nThis is the thing that needs to change within the Judiciary Committee procedures and the penalties\nNot necessarily innocent victims like Dr Ford who I really think she is but the people who are behind that and directing it and in corrupting our government and I'm angry because I don't see anything on any news show talking about how the wrong people have got to be punished\nI'm going to agree with all agree it was Seventy five percent of your point you're I I Do want to ask you specifically you say that you're not angry at at Christine forward here\nDo you feel that ah you see anything wrong by going under oath and and involving herself in this process saying that she was one hundred percent certain that Brett Kavanaugh sexually assaulted her\nWell here's what we don't know we don't know what was said and her um sessions her therapy sessions I don't know that some therapist or some lawyer may have talk her into it you know when when you're that exposed and you're that vulnerable\nMemories can be created all over the place I've been reading all kinds of articles about that so I I don't know enough about the woman to be angry what I Know enough is that I can see that she was used by people who didn't know enough I mean if if that was really that big of a problem Dianne Feinstein whether bonded out day one\nShe knew that that wasn't provable in court and she knew that the longer she waited the bigger political bang she was going to get out of it and putting the attorneys who hated track to begin with and in charge of it\nShe knew that was another lose situation\n... ... the border she calculate wrong\nIt's interesting now you bring up a lot of compelling an interesting point I still can't get there in in terms of having necessarily been\nCoerced into this mindset remember she's a professional in the field\nI I mean after all I mean as part of her credibility she was telling us about how uh you know emotions are are stored in and memories are stored in the hit the campus was that they only won by the way when she pulled out there went seriously this is how you're attempting to establish your credibility as a witness it was one of those moments where it's like okay\nWhat are the tactic is there a but but anyway on you know I I still feel she's kind of like you go under oath\nYou're you're involved in this process you say you're one hundred percent certain you provide all these witnesses and the thing that's odd to if she was going to end up being co worst by you know some a psychologist that these are the memories that you really had\nWhere was she of received all those names that she provided as the witnesses I mean that's difficult for somebody who was a third party that wouldn't have been involved in that process to to instill in her a I just\nCan't quite get there but otherwise very compelling and ah

and that's what I've been talking about right along in fact when I was last with you we can go to say that was the entire premise of what I was sharing during the course of the show\nThis entire cabinet thing was not about the Supreme Court he was not about Brett Kavanaugh it was about all of us because if they could take down Brett Kavanaugh was that accusation or accusations without any evidence without any evidence and we just presume if we don't like you you're guilty or all screwed group\nI mean that is the end of the story and so the single most important thing that has happened here is not that Brett Kavanaugh is about to be approved for the Supreme Court the United states the single most important thing is that the presumption of guilt wasn't accepted here\nThat was far more important then again it's a razor thin margin were riding on right now we're that\nClose that close to vote today to the presumption of guilt being the new way that we do things here in this country\nAnd could you imagine could you imagine how involved and people would be not just towards politicians but again if somebody got sideways with your work somebody got sideways with your kids to

anything\n[laughter]\n[laughter]\nOh yeah [noise]\nBy the way that's just some of what police have to be with\nUs talking about the importance of supporting our bullies because of what goes on out there that's gotten a crab they're dealing with today in the capital as you have the the protesters and again from a political movement standpoint who doesn't want to be part of that\nLeave ideology and by the wayside for a moment one of the things I've never been able to get my brain around\nHow especially young people go yeah those people make a lot of sense you know what I should be due I should be\nNo I should be do I should be part of that now\nLet's be real for a mom and a lot of the those folks in D.C are pros they're paid these are folks who don't have lives the rest of us we got to work we have lives\nAnd we uh you know go about our business letter of the day and go oh okay that's what the losers were up to today yes those are the losers were up to today the losers that go out there and they get paid and in many cases they end up getting paid more if they're willing to get arrested so yes they did they are those people but nevertheless\nJust in terms of winning hearts and minds it's fascinating now\nUs uh segments talking about police talking about law enforcement and we've had obviously this immigration debate that's going on for ever and a seemingly no resolution inside but the other um aspect of\nThat conversation that often as ... ... refugees and I have long had my focus on refugees\nFor a couple of reasons one is principal and the other the implications of refugees\nNow a lot of was made though it wasn't big in the news cycle because obviously we know what the news cycle has been\nBut a lot was made that we ended up having the fewest refugees in decades at least since Nineteen Seventy five according to the state department oh my gosh we're not importing you know even more people are into the United states in paying for all that to happen\nOr ... according to PBS at the end of August only Nineteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety nine refugees had been brought in the prior eleven months compared to forty five thousand that weren't dissipated oh my gosh and that was a bad thing right\nAnd then they went on to talk about how we're only anticipating three thousand being brought in next year oh my gosh that's just terrible now here's one is often not discussed the implications\nThe implications when are we going to be compassionate to Americans before we tried to be compassionate to the rest of the world\nHere's the way this works what you're not told\nWe as taxpayers pay you to bring the refugees into the United states average costs tend to be around fourteen thousand dollars per refugee and according to the center for Immigration Studies a typical immigrant guess what happens when they get here well they have on government assistance for a minimum of five years\nAnd the average five year cost per refugee sixty four thousand three hundred and Seventy bucks that you're ready\nTo hear how much it costs to relocate a refugee into a safe so if we get involved\nA thousand fifty seven bucks so we can actually relocate Bronx only sixty four refugees into safe zones without importing them into the United states\nAnd by the way Ninety One percent of refugees we bring into the United states end up on food stamps and sixty eight percent also ended up receiving ongoing welfare other programs made available now how compassionate is that\nToday we found out that we have the lowest unemployment rate in many decades three point seven percent\nHow is it that we made progress with those that have been a long term unemployed those that had the toughest time those that were not as educated that orange skilled how have we made improvement in young unemployment anybody ever think that maybe cracking down on illegal immigration\nAnd not bringing in refugees to compete for entry level work might make a difference\n[noise] something that's never discussed back on June seventh of last year I actually made the case for how it could happen\nAnd we have seen over the past year plus exactly that is it anywhere near the entire we said no but it absolutely is part of the reason people automatically suggest that we have a responsibility and that kind of cost\nTo import people in the competed against the most vulnerable in our society\nHere really cared about the most vulnerable in society you hit mentally opportunity than for Donald Trump has been doing his policy once again\nOmission is the most pervasive form of bias in the media\nTwo sides to stories one side of the fact I'm Brian I'm On the great one Margo\n... FM\nI enjoy helping my listeners like Nathaniel who owe the IRS tens of thousands in back taxes he told the Irish they didn't have the money to pay but it didn't matter they put a lean on his home anyway it's an annual heard how much I respect optimal tax relief\nWhat you don't hear the for cops that have been killed in the line of duty over the past week and their families the widows kids without fathers that's what's real\nAnd if not for us in then who's going to be so again every cop is a good one but a hundreds of thousands almost all of them are and God Bless them because if not for them where are any of us are any of us\nUh let's see I I Believe we're actually getting in right now on the line that the police officer I'll go ahead and go right to you you get to the front of the line because you're another the police officer\nIt's also want to hear from you in go\nAnd see how are you tonight\nHey doing well fantastic\nI just wanted to comment that I have to agree with all your saying I've been in law enforcement now for six years and\nIt's especially with coming from my department you you just see a face to face 'cause we are in a college town itself so\nI'm everything that the media puts out toward this you're definitely feeling it especially from the younger generation who only been taught that way and it's like one interaction after another where you're trying to change that\nGod Bless you man and are the folks who served with you um you know there is one thing I'll tell you in a again I Do the series down here in South Florida every week I Will tell you that there is a lot of support\nKind of like the silent majority that came out and made Donald Trump president elected more Republicans top to bottom of the United states of America and twenty sixteen than any other point since Nineteen twenty eight\nOf us out there are a lot of good folks that better really do get a in that do support yeah I Know just Albany is depicted in the media and certainly with many politicians but but there's a strong and and thank you guys were all you do a certainly is appreciated\nBy will switch gears go back to senator Collins in her big day Joe in Gainesville, Florida Joe do [noise]\n[noise] Hey Joe [noise] do Europe [noise] alright\nJoe you're you're you're up let's go to Glen in Springfield, Illinois Glenn go\nTo Brian uh can you hear me good yeah we got you\nOkay hey thanks for taking my call and thank you for all that you know\nI'm On call and uh some central Illinois I'm I'm proud to say that Springfield is my home town that's where I'm calling from but I'm I'm afraid to say I'm not proud that big turban was from my home town [noise]\nAnd uh I heard some of the comments that he made the other day a face to face to Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd I was appalled\nAh that's there's no uh respect there no oh I Know a professional demeanor now\nI think that Dick Durbin and and and I'm saying it I'm One of his constituents Springfield, Illinois take care of an old saying that apology\nNo doubt and I I I credit senator college it's refreshing that she took the time to sit down with this man and get a one on one card I caught a conversation\nWith him I give her credit for that no doubt gosh you\nFind this moment and uh you're absolutely right about urban and all the others I mean to me how many politicians are we we started with Chuck Schumer today and be Chuck Schumer sexual assault allegation a blind\nEye he before we heard or anything from from Christine Ford before we had any facts present it said that he believes her in what happened in this country in part\nBecause of people like Dick Durbin because of people like Chuck Schumer who said that they believed her\nThat's all part of the damage that was done in this country to go to Anthony in New York Anthony go\nHey how are you all good very much for your for your great show [noise] uh I just wanted to say I'm finally proud of the Republicans I'm an independent but\nI'm really family proud of the Republicans they started fighting back\nUh it looks like a karate kid number three hundred and sixty or where are you know Mr me I eat trout goes out and that is a ... or ... how to fight back against that early age\nAnd the Democratic definitely didn't expect this so they they they got there they got it handed to them so I moved out of them\nYou got an interesting take here this is not something that's been advanced it at least in my presence before um interest if you get your day you were saying that potentially Donald Trump being Donald Trump may be provided the\nNecessary Jews for Chuck Grassley to figure out that he's now washed job for Susan Collins ago holy cow I Do have the backbone for Lindsey Graham too I don't know it actually attempt to be Spartacus is that kind of what you're you're talking about here\n... really because I mean if you remember when Trump Card every time every time they were clearly something everybody everybody would go hide under rocks\nAnd now they're all coming there are fighting back and they're standing up and I mean clearly I mean that gets recon Murkowski or it could be ... and then turn around and when I stepped in it\nBut uh it's okay she actually she knows how to say welcome to Walmart once it gets worse it gets thrown out of a not elected again so we'll see how that goes as far as the rest of them go finally crowded I'm standing up and do it\nI don't I'm standing up and doing the right thing arguably Walmart deserves better but I appreciate that that's a really really compelling thought um get good call Anthony in New York there but stay in New York for a moment and let's go to Frank Frank spin extremely patient a Frank go\nYes ah Ryan but I just want to say I support the confirmation of a justice Brett Kavanaugh but I just want to find out I I've been thinking about this the whole entire week what's wrong with these Democratic senators how can they keep believing the stories from the\nFrom the lady uh but actually they actually don't know what the procedural issues are in the Senate they don't understand what they're talking about when they're accusing Brett Kavanaugh of things they have the actual physical evidence in regards to miss the capital had showed every bit of evidence he's proven where the timeframe where he's been\nAnd what he has done throughout his life and they continually for some reason\nTo believe that what they hear from this woman is actually true I'm not saying whether it is or is it\nBut I Believe I'm Sorry a a missed them but I have five bar a democratic where we're from the city of New York I have a different understanding of different things but I I feel very sad that the Democratic centers in Congress are confused\nIn regards to what they're thinking feel about Brett Kavanaugh as a whole I think they should give this guy won the last chance and then we will see if they were right and if they ... they should actually think about resigning [noise]\nInteresting a very interesting call their oil and I understand given your political disposition to why you were inclined to travel down to bad they're given them one more chance\nMy my daughter will ultimately is a ... a bit more of maybe set a goal which is you know the it's the by any means necessary and you know politics Trump's all pun intended\nBut uh it ... the special coming from a Democrat to hear that on principle you think there comes a point or close to it to where these people should resign All right so I Am by mud in for the great one month\nOne of my point nine ... am six thirty Washington Mall W and a half years\nDid you know the teams are willing to share a happier less stress and more connected to others according to the opponent just by the spirit
