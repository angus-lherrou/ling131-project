down you can put back up again but\nThat but if you think that a thoughtful play by play and political and now says you're not because that was in his fault on our White House\nWe're not we're not a ... you began to analyze some of that stuff that was said I'm as we warned you talk a little bit of profanity week there was actually more than you heard we we were able to bleach some of it out [laughter] ah but there was a public did make it in there\nOkay mom or you know one of\nThe school of arming there I'll get this is just so terrible is just so awful I mean I Can't believe anything like that has ever happened at the White House flash back just a few years Snoop Dogg went to the White House you know the great intellectual Snoop Dogg\nHe was the or snoop lion or whatever he calls himself these days whatever variety of animal from the animal kingdom he calls himself to follow snoop\nOkay to snoop dog was at the White House and you know and he got at the White House here Snoop Dogg talking about how he choked at the White House and everyone in the media thought this was hilarious\nAnd feed you and when you got a high before the White House did you also then smoke it up a

is an office where only great things have happened this office no great presidents had he was about FDR they sat in his office Monica Lewinsky note in his office I keep coming back to that because again if you're talking about the filing\nThe oval office there is a level beyond having Kanye West there and so the media again ignoring the fact the bronco bomb was ever present I loved it that oh my God how could hobnobbing with celebrities\nOut of the kid rock to the White House here is a picture of Jay Z and Beyonce in the situation room\nMonkeys can't see the photo at the picture of Jay Z

it was vomit and it was that it was telling you ain't going to the White House and it was just terrible and then you remember that remember common going to go ahead you remember common is a rapper\nWho has in the past ... song ... an actual terrorist an actual terrorists are there he was in the White House but don't worry it's it it it did file the White House in any way to have\nThese

you know comedy rap about supporting terrorism in the White House ... was there in ... said nice things in or a magazine out what was what was really bad here as common during the Obama administration\nIt's an honor to be here in the White House library the tiny Desk Concert series has tried to give voice to people who have something to say in a culture we move our culture forward and do amazing stuff in the spirit NPR Music presents comments or if you look\nThen April Ryan shows up to April Ryan is supposedly a reporter she's actually mostly an accident and she was on CNN and she brought up a guy named ray Jay now for those who you are not culturally fluid\nRe Jay ... is most famous for having done a sex tape of ... who's currently Kanye West wife so Congress has married him kind of action came crashing rose to prominence off the on the back no pun intended\nOf the rage a sex tape April Ryan went for comment on the ... visit to the White House and the guy who ... wife on tape before she knew cognac\nAll ... members in the media just all class here is April mind doing that retain\nA text messaging with rage ... yeah you know who wage aids he's\nHe was once close with Kim car Daschle and he said I think that is great a great opportunity for young black entrepreneurs an artist to talk one on one with the president's the United states of America and he goes on to say that but in watching this hang from CNN he did say he's a little concerned [laughter] um the areas of concern right now\nOkay reaching out to the ex lover of a guy's wife for comment\nIs just I mean is it that is not even beyond the bounds of journalistic ethics has to be on the bounds of ethics period is beyond ethics and it's crazy stuff that's crazy why in the world would you think that range age has anything unique to offer to the situation except the one slept with chemical dashing on tape that\nHow is that even on CNN CNN called news network and do that sort of thing that's just and garbage it's just garbage I think it's even worse than that so Don Lemon who is\nA disgrace to the name of objective journalism it's amazing like there are people who I think tried to be objective on CNN I said before I think Jake Tapper very often tries to be objective and tries to actually do his job done one that has has forsaken all relationship with\nObjectivity but still somehow calls himself an objective news reporter not in opinion journalists serious John Lennon\nIn invoking Kanye West's dead mother to attack him his bed and mother to attack him door this is just journalism guy so much and journalism in so much reporting happening right here\nThis was an embarrassment on your mother is rolling over in her grave I spoke to one of her friends to their touched it with one of her friends today from Chicago joined us from are you still live there I Know she's gone to would be what would be embarrassed by this\nThat an okay thing is that something that we're doing now are a lot of technical dead relatives is their dead relatives to attack them not their dead relatives in the sense that like their dead relatives did something wrong but in the sense that ain't dead relatives who you didn't know and know nothing about and add a relationship with this man that she would be ashamed of him\nThat should be ashamed of Kanye West like\nThat that this was sick I'm Sorry this is just sick and the media is overall reaction to the ... what shows up in the White House is indicative of a couple of different things one is indicative of the fact that when a black person says they like President Trump ... the media have no one like a black person who said they like President Trump no one\nBecause they have violated the attendance an intersection out which suggest that we all think like our group we all think like our ethnic group so if you break away from that ethnic group or you break away from that sexual grew right you're a gay person who likes from or you're a woman who likes from any of those things in your at trader\nOr we saw this with all the women who supported Brett Kavanaugh they were there were sex traders they've just given into the patriarchy they internalize The Handmaid's tale and now we see this was calling us he's a black guy who's really white on the inside he's an Oreo right on these black on the outside the white on the inside he's he's in the sunken place\nAs people are now saying rented it and that sort of stuff\nIs deeply race but that's why the left is is so upset with Tanya is because he breaks two of their rules one he's a black men's sports from not allowed\nTo use the celebrities reports from also not all out for people to understand how much from his hate in Hollywood you have to understand that in Hollywood if you even express it remotely right wing opinion you will never work again\nNever work again I I said before I have to ... listen to show their major eight ... I'm not talking a celebrity and talking a plot celebrities who listen to the show and I visited with some of them I've had lunch or breakfast people come into this office were quite famous and\nAlways tell them do not mentioned that you have been here if you wish to work in this town because of biased in Hollywood is so extreme than it doesn't matter you're sizes\nI always tell them do not mentioned that you have been here if you wish to work in this town\nBecause of biased in Hollywood is so extreme than it doesn't matter you're sizes celebrity if you said even associated with me and I didn't vote for Trump and twenty six day and if you say that you associated with me just a mainstream conservative was pretty reasonable\nAnd that is enough to lose your job by that actually happened out here with mark and plus you just got destroy red markets lost the guy who directed wild wild country on Netflix and he's done a bunch of other is on the ... the Mindy project he's in a bunch of other stuff he came in here because you wanted to get a pro gun opinion from somebody\nFor his new movie and they came in and I gave him like an an hour and a half and I said don't tell anyone you've been here because if you do it will blow back on you and then he foolishly went on Twitter and said I was a nice guy and it ended his world\nWas attacked so harshly on Twitter he deleted this week and then put up with we apologize for ever having pointed that I was a nice guy\nApologizing for that that's how it works in Hollywood county has broken two rows a black man and he's extraordinary famous and if you're a black extraordinarily famous person you are not allowed to be pro Trump and you're not allowed to be concerned with it anyway you have to total liberal line\nAnd you wonder why did you say is great shock and dismay Taylor Swift came out and embrace the Democratic party because if you do not embrace the Democratic party and you are a celebrity they will tear you down\nAnd we're on

I'm speaking to the captain Peter love of the United States Navy retired who was an incident that night where you are thinking that you were about to make a headline in ... we\nWe were well aware that had the ammunition exploded on the the uh ... explosives that were on the tactic that we would have demolished not only our ship but the whole a pass for a one Seventeen which consisted of\nA two other allies tease the ass scare and and ... and the two um\nShips that are a ... ... people station to board them\nRight or you do have rescue crews and going inside the ship and they worked in conditions that down dramatically awful and they were pulling people out all the time you eventually lost it it was the final count Peter because people die from their bones is uh twenty three twenty four twenty five\nFinal count was uh twenty three that perished or from the uh the mining and under another twenty seven that uh were injured but with a crew of only a hundred and thirty two you're talking about a third of the crew\nBeing either killed or injured\nNow the part I like is that the navy doesn't quit okay fine there you've got your your your ship was blown up by a mind you've got to put it together again so you beach the craft and then build damn around it settled a carpet\nDown basically a gun some I'm Still I'm I'm\n... lives in subsequent days says you're working on your show yes uh but you've got a ruptured steal All right you you have to you have to rebuild the whole yourself where are you going to get to steal\nWell fortunately we were able to calm Shaw which is a military expression for finding things where they are are\nYou stole it [laughter]\nI Know when you say that All right you borrowed it from the United States Army I said yes yes five you borrowed it from the United States Army don't they miss steel beams [laughter] apparently they didn't I understand okay you borrow\nYour steel beams and other ... from the United States Army and you repair the ship yourself I guess that's what you know you do it yourself you know\nThey were actually there are a number of the bee had also assisted in the um welding and repair the ship\nAll right so you flow to ship off and you're now going to go to the yards in Japan is that where you're heading\nWe're headed for your ... Japan which was a home court of the ship\nYou've lost a lot of people the the ship is the ships morality shaken by your going to sail back to your home port and your sailing across the sea of Japan and here comes the typhoon\nCorrect yeah uh in the middle of the sea of Japan you're going to be hit with a typhoon in your ship is not entirely sea worthy corral\nWere not entirely see where they and there was some thought that actually the um\nThe keel might have had been cracked which we couldn't tell the kill gets cracked a crack opens on the ship breaks into two parts\nAnd here comes the types of do you remember the typhoon Peter I do\nRemember and the hard part of the Las T is a very flat bottom there's no no point in the um the part that goes into the water so when you head into heavy seas they ship goes up and then comes down and pounds into the ocean\nAnd it's a this is great fear that the founding of that going to shake the I'm I'm a ... of the hall but kill but also the ah repairs stop start popping off the side of the ship\nOr sell those aren't beams that you buy in from the U.S army or a little shaky at this moment there and very shaky\nAnd after a while they we have open water to the ocean to actually flowing into and flowing out of the compartments fortunately because of the water tightened integrity of the ship had\nWere able to uh you know make it back to your school without\nUh any further problems\nSo sure you're just going to nonchalant of types of an okay you get to ... and they're going to repair the ship and you're going to go back into combat aren't here but they're not going to\nThey're not polluted in a three months later we were back in Vietnam\nAnd your job was to return to a supplying this enormously dangerous equipment\nThe U.S army in the U.S Marine Corps the air force the navy and serve out your tour\nOr mislead dangerous equipment to the U.S army the U.S Marine Corps the air force navy and serve out your tour that's correct and it's now fifty years your shipmates the ones who were last there on the wall in Washington is that correct they are on the wall in Washington\nAnd what do you remember about captain Brandon about chief Sullivan about the men who acted that night or to save the ship what is your memory\nMy memory is that they were courageous they told her they knew what had to be done to say the ship and save the ... and they went ahead and did it\nKept in captain Peter love the United States Navy retired remembering when he was an incident on the USS Westchester County November first Nineteen sixty eight fifty years gone I'm John bachelor this just the John bachelor show\nMy point nine\nI don't begrudge him\nAnd the need to occasionally thrilled bone to Washington to say oh I'm for a Fifteen dollar minimum wage he's not foolish he knows that this can be a barrier to employment for some people\nBut he has to police masters who don't care that he's a great businessmen and precisely because he is a great businessmen wants to cut 'em down to size so he must needlessly\nAnd and unfortunately play the Washington game on occasion\nI Know John in parentheses in your column you mentioned that if Bezos was interested in cutting down the number of workers he must pay he wouldn't have bought whole foods that you eat to stay that labor intensive is an understatement good heavens [noise]\nWhy isn't that true he's doing this as he's starting to add a brick and mortar stores in the form of bookstores and he's doing it as he buys whole foods\nUm he ... the best way to reach customers is to have\nOn the ground stores and so this is not about taking out as competitors again no one wants low wage workers think about any business you weren't you want to get the most talented workers who logically costs more that's the path to grow businesses don't become\nReally unsuccessful by exploiting their workers Amazon's not going to be the first\nWe go from one self made man Jeff Bezos and the future is bright for Amazon that is a solar system brand for heaven's sakes do another self made man or is he he is now the president of the United states Donald J Trump the New York times has reported\nThat they can document and I don't doubt them than Mr Trump inherited more than four hundred million dollars from his father who was a very successful real estate developer in New York and in the boroughs [noise]\nA job in the puzzle here is does receiving four hundred million dollars from your father make you a self made man when you're worth billions [noise] uh yes\nIt most certainly does make you a self made man let's look at the four four hundred there airs in it and there are self made man it it's very rare that there's both in it and Trump's case\nNo one's going tonight it surprised exactly no one that he inherited more than the one million he claimed what his father was a very successful outer borough real estate developer obviously a brilliant guy there's no question about that but Donald Trump has his name on buildings and Manhattan\nThe most difficult and competitive real estate market in the world he has his name on buildings around the world by the New York times\nVery own reasoning he is one of the great marketers of all time or will lent list marketer relentless dealmaker if that's not self made what he did turning what his father gave him into a global brand I don't know what is\nBecause Mr Trump is often in the news and because we're watching him as a president quite apart from as a businessman\nWhat I read in the New York times is that Fred Trump and then the family took advantage of the uh the IRS seeing in in the and\nThe rules that the IRS keeps changing over these last decades about inherited wealth I didn't see any law breaking John So I'm quite puzzled there's resentment for people who have inherited money or the resentment for people who are self made\nThere's this suspicion is that they're doing something sinister\nJohn they're creating jobs it's it's entirely lost apparently the New York times that that money that Donald Trump translated into his branding as worldwide branding has been responsible for generating lots of livelihoods around the world you would say at all the time John So I Want you to\nHelp the audience understand why it is that rich people are the job creators\n... let's say I want to stress ... your your point to New York times acknowledge that everything Fred Trump did to avoid taxes was over\nBut first I Want to stress ... your your point to New York times acknowledge that everything Fred Trump did to avoid taxes was okayed by the Internal Revenue service there was nothing illegal here and thank goodness\nFred Trump did and the Trump family did what Bill gates family does what Mark Zuckerberg's what any rich person does is try to minimize their tax Bill Bissett gets to your question the rich create all the opportunity precisely because they have unspent wealth\nInvestment is what drives

failures as any successful businessmen as head but he turned ... was given into into something much greater into a global brand he created this is not a political statement you know I'm very critical of Trump a lot but\nWhat he did as a businessman is self made how many heirs can we point to you or in New York it's littered with airs how many did what Trump did\nTaking what the what was handed

does not mean someone isn't out the at you and it could be very well the case here that there is\nThey could be great dissatisfaction within the engineering crews that build these things because they don't get paid much effect it paid a pittance compared to engineers the rest of the world and the management is not great\nAnd detectives generally been poor and so Russia's around the country right

investigation and report is going to satisfy the doubt that are now cemented about rock cosmos is quality control and their ability to be successful\nI think that's what I'll give it a slightly different perspective John which is that like NASA I actually trust that they will investigate this early pin down what the problem was and fix and make sure that problem doesn't exist on late at missions\nLike NASA with less program which has had numerous show Ga oh an inspector general reports over the last eight years telling us how badly it's managed I Would expect them to fix\nThe more systemic underlying\nProblems that are causing this that the problems just like in ... is not really fixing its management problems they fix each individual person specific thing and don't fix the overall issue and you can't do it when you've got a government run system you don't have competition to force you to fix the problems and so\nI think all that means is I think they will get this particular problem fixed it they will be able to launch again soon but I think it just it's just more ammunition we've got to stop depending on them because they do not have a a good system\nAnd and what we're switching to is private enterprise and competition increases the chance we won't have similar problems on our upper commercial launches\nBob detail here not that has not fail with protons

didn't have the authority to make those authorizations and they went ahead and did it anyway that's downright criminal actually I have to tell you\nNow grown into a mob was adolescents not criminal lessons brought before the bar of justice I cannot accept a trusting Ross cosmos\nThat there there's no transparency about there's no reason to go back to them for anything else unless you're looking for more trouble because there's no expectation that they can they can solve what has been creating these failures\nIn that context John we are in a hundred percent agreement\nThis is why I think we should be accelerating our own man programs as fast as possible we should\nWe should really try to get out from her line them in total agreement us I pointed out they might fix this particular problem but as you just said they're not going to be fixing the underlying problem just isn't that that doesn't fix the underlying problems that have felt less government agencies don't do that\nI sat on manned possibly not the worst thing so let's go to that so I'm looking for a success here Bob rocket place is a good one a rocket what is it\nRocket lab is that the American slash New Zealand company they launch a New Zealand that built an electron rocket it's a small rocket designed to small or large small sets\nAnd they did was successful launch back in January they were going to do another another operational on that first operation wash in June and had to cancel it because of a problem with a motor control they say\nAnd the delay kicked in extended until finally about a month and a half called they announced that going to do a uh\nFollow up with a launch in December um\nToday they and now they unveiled I'm a vet new rocket production facility in New Zealand and what's really interesting about this facility is it's designed to mass produce the rockets they want to be able to turn out a rocket electron rocket once a week at this facility\nThat's a significant thing because that's a complete change in how rockets built I mean it's basic has tried to make it this way but nobody has ever built rockets with that I my idea in mind mass producing them and getting done to them to do with this implies is that um they've\nAnnounced this ... this factory because I think what they're thinking they incorporated into corrections that they had to do to the motor controller and they purposely delayed for the launches bill they got that exactly right\nSo they could also put it into the facility that's going to do these rockets and so when they get these next two launches off in November and December this tells the I think what that means is that going to hit the ground running in twenty Nineteen and we'll be aiming for fall frequent more frequent launches maybe as many as one a wink for weeks\nThe entire year it'll be just a matter of how many customers they got they have contracted by the way they can just keep putting them on the planet I'm going to be quite exciting on\nThem and it keeps the website beyond the black when we come back\nWe'll go we'll go exploring with his base engineering I'm Jon Benet\nJon ... is\nBalance of nature's fruits and veggies in a
