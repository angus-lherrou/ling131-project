fact Democrats openly stating that my politics are okay and the media suggesting that Democrats have said no such thing and there's no such thing as the Democratic not take for example dominance of Don Lemon last night\nHe had um a GOP commentator and Alice Stewart and she was talking about President Trump who's ripping on the Democrats as an angry left him up\nAnd here is how it went down to London said so so Alice Stewart said that calling these folks a mob was actually accurate pointing to people who are banging on the doors to the Supreme Court and people who've rats Senator Cruz and Heidi cruise\nAs well as yelling and Jeff Flake confusing pounds in elevators and lemon said but that doesn't mean people don't get to object that's you're right it's Americans object discovered in the first amendment is like the first one\nAnd then Lewis again chimed in and argue that anti cabinet protesters in ... which they get they went into the actual Kavanaugh Senate hearing room and they screened until they were removed\nThey shouted until they were ... that's called my behavior okay some lemon says no that's not my behavior it's people who are upset and they're angry with the way the country is going\nThose two things are not mutually exclusive mobs typically are angry and upset with the way country is doing\nThe reason the media are trying to cover for all this is because the media are beginning to realize that shouting at Republicans is not actually the best strategy for winning and so they're simply going to try to convince you that the person who is shouting in your ear is not real like Harvey the bunny\nBunny just imaginary exist only on your imagination\nIt's not a real thing so media doing their best to try and tamped down the perception of the public that Trump is actually correct about all this and the Republicans are right when they said Mitch McConnell of course is pushing this for Mitch McConnell says listen this behavior and is that Hillary Clinton comments about civility being out of balance is unhinged stuff from the Democrats and then of course it's correct\nThey'll face until I get there was more of those on hedge tactics apparently this is the love rallying cry\nBut fortunately the American people know that the fact free politics of fear\nAnd intimidation\nOr not how we actually govern at our democratic Republican\nWell this is right I mean the Democrats acting like ... children is not going to help them and that's why the media trying to convince you that's not actually what's going on Rand Paul got himself\nIn a little bit of Twitter hot water yesterday or comments that he made a that are exactly correct she said that political assassinations could rise in the United states somebody could be killed\nThanks to all of this violent rhetoric on the part of folks like Hillary Clinton Alison\nI'm somebody go back and listen who contend this sort of aggressive rhetoric from President Trump than twenty sixteen and twice you seen the presidents of the United states when he was just a candidate when he was going to rallies and saying something like punch somebody an all payer legal bills when he was doing that sort of stuff I said that's bad that's ugly he shouldn't be doing it\nWell Democrats are the ones doing it today\nAnd it's just as bad\nIt's just as bad and there'd be more explicit about it too I mean when Hillary Clinton says civility is not required with anybody on the other side of the aisle is pretty damn explicit\nRand Paul says this sort of stuff is going to get somebody killed the mean that Hillary Clinton is going to get somebody killed but the rise in temperature is likely to reach a boiling point at some point here Rand says if he gets all sort of flat all sorts of flak for it\nFeel that there's going to be an assassination I really\nWell in point at some point here ran says that he gets all sort of ... all sorts of flak for it\nI feel that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that someone is going to be killed [noise] and uh that those who are ratcheting up the the the conversation those were actually getting their face with a ... a bear some responsibility if there's over extra\nRoom now people are saying well what about Trump what about okay let's talk about ran for a second it's random one is making a comment Rand Paul has six of his ribs broken by\nToo well hourly wage benefits may have stagnated them well hourly wages stagnated benefits certainly have not\nThe lion's share of non wage benefits as ... Peter Van ... eleven is consumed by the dramatic increase in health insurance costs he says the fixed costs of health insurance are much larger percentage of the total confrontation of lower earnings workers meaning that you did get a raise just came out in your health insurance\nAlso many perhaps most big ticket items used by a typical American family on a daily basis have decreased in price\nSo they they looked at the ... a human progress they look at the prices of common household items advertising the Nineteen Seventy nine Sears catalog and prices of those common household items sold by Wal Mart and twenty Fifteen\nAnd remember those products and twenty fifth you know a hell of a lot better than the products in Nineteen Seventy nine\nA washing machine made and twenty fifth you need a better quality washing machine and a washing machine made in Nineteen Seventy nine a car made today is a better car than a car made in Nineteen Seventy nine\nAll the products are getting are better and you're getting them for cheaper\nHere's what they did they divided in Nineteen Seventy nine nominal prices by Nineteen Seventy nine average nominal hourly wages and two thousand Fifteen nominal prices by two thousand Fifteen average nominal hourly wages and they calculated the time cost of household items in each year that's the number of hours it would take to buy a washing machine for example so for example\nThat time cost me Thirteen cubic foot refrigerator tell by fifty two percent in terms of the hours of work required at the average hourly nominate a wage so if you could buy two refrigerators and the price of one and that makes you Richard regardless of what your top line income is\nNeedless to say the above price productions greatly underestimate the totality of wealth or again by the average American ignoring qualitative aesthetic and environmental improvements on commonly used items again those products are better today than they were yesterday\nSo it's pretty clear it is pretty clear that when it comes to products that we can buy we are much better off than they were in the Nineteen seventies so where are we short or short in education health care and housing because the cost of those things has risen at a faster pace than total compensation\nHowever it is true that today's houses are larger and healthcare is better and education is more high tech\nIs also true that the reason that house that houses have risen in prices because of tremendous regulation on the part of democratic administrations for the most part in major cities the reasoning is the housing shortages in Los Angeles which is the most sprawling said you know in in the country and it's where I live is because of heavy regulation and zoning\nSo what is the standard of living well it's certainly ... it certainly better than it was Nineteen Seventy nine for the vast majority of people in the American public the average apartment is bigger the average stuff you have in your apartment is bigger the average house is better the average stuff that you have in that house is better\nAll of that should suggest that maybe we should be kind of grateful for the country in which we live and stop trying to tear it down and stop trying to tear each other apart in the name of some utopian vision Democrats might be wise to start there especially because the more and rage Democrats ... Republicans lag behind 'cause we we are not fond of the rage but\nIf you in rage us\nWhen you awake that sleeping giant it's not good for you elect poorly is not good for you\nOkay well in just a second I Want to talk about the Democrats' failure to recognize that basic truth in what they're saying now about justice Kavanaugh\nBut first let's talk about your sleep quality I don't think that while on the road you know why because I don't have my sleep mattress with me there was nobody on the planet like you said why would you buy a generic mattress built for somebody else he would sleep they'll to sleep when they take two minutes to complete\nThey use the answers Metra body type and sleep preferences and the perfect mattress\nWhether you're aside sleeper or a hot sleeper whether you like a pleasure from bed with the ... there is no more guessing and no more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes sleep quiz and it will match you to a mattress that will give you the best leap of your life\nFor ... he looks can even split the mattress down the middle providing individual support needs and your preferences for each side and a ten year warranty and get to try it out for a hundred nights risk free right now he lives is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders\nTo a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he looked sleep dot com slash Shapiro the ceiling sleep dot com slash Shapiro for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress order again he would sleep dot com slash Shapiro my wife and I have a Hewlett sleep mattress we took that sleep quiz we ordered the mattress that came in the mail it's just fantastic so good\nWe got one for my sister for a wedding go check it out right now he likes sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nOkay so let's talk about the fact that the west doesn't seem to realize they live in a a great country and that they believe that we all ought to be living in fear every single day now fear mongering is never a wonderful thing if you're going to get exercised about problems in your life you probably should be exercised about problems that are truly prevalent now things that are actually a threat to you and suggesting\nAnd you get exercised about problems in your life you probably should be exercised about problems that\nAre truly prevalent now things that are actually a threat to you and suggesting that every woman in the country is at risk of rape every second of every day is probably not a good way to bring people together it's also not a good way to view your neighbors because the truth is that\nWomen are not at risk of sexual assault every day in the United states of America pretty safe country for women in fact it's the free as safe as perfect for women in the history of mankind so there's that but\nThere's a song it's now become very popular on Twitter and Facebook I I'm not sure what and get her name is Mercedes wins I guess a and she just put up the song and folks on the left are just ecstatic about this on because it suggests that men should not be concerned about false allegations of sexual assault\nWe should not be concerned about it anymore so young\nMen who are worried that in the aftermath of the Brett Kavanaugh nonsense that anybody can be accused at any time without any corroborating evidence they should sit down and shop because women have a tough now there's a logical flaw at the root of that which is two things can be for once\nWomen can be afraid of bad men and men can be afraid of bad wondering why did you see things are supposedly mutually exclusive is beyond me I Do not understand why\nSaying that women have a right to be afraid\nWhen a man of cost them and treat them terribly why is that mutually exclusive with a man has the right to be afraid that a woman will make a false allegation against him I'm not saying that the fears ought to be equivalent in nature I'm not saying that the level of of fear should be equivalent or that the level of prevalence of these events is equivalent\nBut to say that I shouldn't be afraid something bad happening to me because something bad could happen to you makes no sense at all just on a logical level\nAnd the reason I say this is because there are cases many cases across the United states particularly on campus right now where\nMen are being accused of things that they did not do and it's costing them time money and credibility\nSo here's the story of ... I'm Sorry James then when you get into this lady song\nSo James was a freshman at the University of California Davis this is according to reason magazine\nWho's on his way to math class when he received an email that we drill his life for the next few months universities title nine office which handles sexual misconduct disputes between students was investigating a complaint against him this was in February twenty Eighteen right after Harvey Weinstein and Al Franken and all the rest\nJames that this was not a good time to get accused of something like this email from the title nine compliance officer when into great detail about the seriousness of James situation it would be investigated in accordance with university sexual assault and sexual violence policies as well as the student code which covers physical assault presser violence and conduct at Britain's health and safety\nThe finding of responsibility could result in suspension or even expulsion your email was short on details of the alleged conduct according to the title nine off as a female student in Becky and complains that James touched her on the bread and butter over and under her clothing without her consent\nJames who Becky classmates and drama and briefly friends on the even about Tobar twenty two thousand Seventeen they'd met up with some other friends to play music eventually finding themselves alone and Becky storm they kiss for a few minutes and engaged in some light sexual touching before other students interrupted them\nIn James's view encounter had not only been fully consensual it was also mutual but people are just as much responsibility for initiating it as James\nAs Becky would later made clear to the investigator should also touched him sexually she wasn't really describes her own actions are official statements\nJames attorney wrote about the incident and uh and here's what they wrote that these accounts of the incident as set forth in the summary of her investigative interviews does not on his face allege any active prohibited conduct\nOf matter investigation continued until may first at which time the officers student and judiciary affairs finally concluded that James was innocent even so back it was a afforded the opportunity to appeal the decision consistent with university policy is dictated by the Obama administration's education department\nAt cost James twelve thousand dollars in legal fees to defend himself against an allegation in which the girl admitted admitted that she was mutually involved in the sexual conduct\nI mean it's pretty astonishing according to back east complaint\nThe kissing followed a night of mutual flirting and started out romantic eventually she either ask him to close it close to herself they continued kissing and also touching as they grind it against each other\nAnd he said he says my hand started making my way of her back slowly respectfully testing the waters gym's open his eyes make sure that he was enjoying what was happening she seemed into it and so he touched her over her clothes pins removed his shirt and she told him to drop it on the floor so in other words she was involved in every step of all of this\nRight at one point James became too forceful he was running against her she was pressed against the closet door and Becky asked him to be more gentle he agreed and toned down the grinding Becky admits that she kissed James's neck but didn't think she gave me ... she did however asking whether he was into certain types of sexual activity\nAnd she says that she was aroused by all of that so she says all of this to the title nine court costs and twelve thousand dollars anyway so should Mindy worried about the sort of thing\nWhy not why wouldn't they wouldn't you'll be worried about the sort of stuff but according to feminist because women have a completely separate\nSet of here's some of which are justified and some of which are overstated men should not be worried about anything\nThere's women have a completely separate set of here's some of which are justified in some of which are overstated\nMen should not be worried about anything right cabinet guilty because bad things happen to women is basically the logic blessed and then they wonder why folks on the center and on the right or not interested in this particular point of view well here is that this song from Mercedes lens expressing that's bizarre point of view that bad that women are threatened bad things happen to them therefore men should shut up\nHere she is thinking about having five million use on Twitter it's gone viral of course\nThe conflation of I'm Upset about justice cabinet with America is just an ugly unjust against women\nIs just it's it's absurd and its ally and I'm speaking as a guy with my own daughter with three older sisters it's\nIt it's still in us but again the motivating factor for a lot of left right now is rage and they don't understand that

Modi these very powerful and assertive prime minister of India\nThere's also a mentioned in a paragraph this is the NBC riding of S. four hundred last time I checked that's a very powerful weapon Cleo India\nRussia together again not since the Soviet days do you understand how this goes what is the what is the intention of Mr Modi showing friendliness towards the aggressor in in Ukraine and Syria good evening to\nGood evening Hi where are the question is who can be used against and really there's only one country that is likely to be the game tonight to China\nWhich is why I think it's perhaps not as concerning for Washington and black mind um the sector gate ... pale and had Secretary Mattis we're in Delhi signing a much more important agreement\nWhich is a contact that which is that communication agreement with Delhi which will dramatically increased and proper ability between me and ... and the American\nAnd I'm sure that the sale with Scott ... meaning and if he had had very serious concern they would have been addressed at that time so there there's the Little Rock believe for sanctions but given the politics I I Would hope that there wouldn't be any\nYou to put a little context and is the United states sanction China for by the same as four hundred a anti aircraft system from the I'm from the Russians and and clearly I don't I Can't see the U.S sanctioning India and that must be as you point out\nSystem from the um some of the Russians and and clearly I don't I Can't see the U.S should in India and that must be as you point out a sign of enduring partnership between deli in Washington\nSo these two countries started to work much more closely um but you know Modi seems to be playing a very interesting game of outreach not only to boot and not only to the United states but also to China what's going on there Cleo\nSays the the China focus is always or are we not been overtly economic you know an Indian needs investments um it was hoping to get quite a bit of an investment from Japan it and it's gotten some investment from Japan\nBut Modi in order to be reelected and you know there are elections coming up in the spring of twenty Nineteen really needs to deliver on things like jobs if that sounds familiar I'm so he needs investment and\nThe goal with the Chinese engagement was to try to get the financial engagement with the political or security compromise that sometimes goes with dealing with China\nAnd clearly has ... and the investment he's expected from the United states\n[noise] it has been as a as easy as it could have been um but I think there have been um problems on both sides\nThere are a lot of um vested interest in Delhi or that had been slowing things down as well um a lot of people made a lot of money from a lot of different sorts of relationships so\nI'm ... and sales are involved um you're looking at relationships that may be going back decades including back to the Cold War times and\nUm people in systems who um have vested interest in other alliances or other purchases\nSo clearing away all of that brush in order to get things that are good for the strategic core of a nation can sometimes take a bit more time than expected\nSo puzzle about blood and reporting does he have a neutral image in Delhi is he regarded as somebody we can work with is there a general opinion\nThere's been a very long during they kind of so called non aligned period India's not on period um they did get a lot of weaponry from the Soviet Union and then from the Russians at a time when the U.S really wouldn't touch India at all so um there is you know it it it's not considered a problem and\nUm I think there was during during the time when um the west was backing some pretty nasty elements in Afghanistan um the Indian knew that this ... problem would flow back to India\nAnd were I'm not averse to working with the Soviets during that time either to try to contain it so a lot of their relationship with Russia is very much a reflection of their immediate border you know the problems with our hottest on one side and the problem with China on the other and\nThat's the lens through which they view their relationship with Moscow\nAnd clear what is the state of flu between Islam about um do you today\nOh it's terrible uh and in fact what China did I'm immediately after ah India bought the ... the a missile defense system was it announced it was going to sell some very high tech drones to Pakistan so essentially opening up a second front for that missile system to try to defend from\nThe puzzle also about India playing the Russian card if that's what their play this can be a dangerous game the Russians are not easy to work with you that forgotten the Soviet days does that regarded as that was all that was then there's just now is that the fresh thinking\nNot really because they're because if you look at the age of the people in both administrations they there are people who would have been engaging with each other perhaps his juniors\nOr during the Soviet period so they know each other um you know there there was there was all sorts of stories about Soviet infiltration into the Indian system during the during that period as well\nA lot of compromise material all that sort of stuff\nThat's the way of putting it yes [laughter]\nSo um you know I think it takes a long time to to to read\nThat up but also you know they ... the Soviets were there for India at a time when sometimes others weren't but there is that the more serious problem is that a lot of the stuff that Russia sold to India has not been great\nThe quality has been particularly good and the price plans to keep going up and up and up with a very slow delivery\nSo the actual quality of what's been sold in the past has been a real problem\nYes I Wonder if they're going to send all those old broken so ... and ... back to Moscow their money back I'm not sure they'd make the flight ...\nBy the garden of the ... and it becomes much more um [noise] the great game here with Russia entering into us\nYou know whoever wins India as a partner is certainly got the leverage because India is enormous within about four years

seven scientific instruments we're going to map the surface of ultimate to determine what its geology is all about and how was formed\nWe're going to map it in stereo so that we can determine that the ...\nWe're going to map it in color so that we can see if there are variations across the surface that indicate past activity\nCurrent activity or even a that it was made of several different things that came together we're going to map its surface composition with our composition spectrometers we're going to search for satellites we're going to search for rings we're going to search for weather has an atmosphere\nAnd if it has satellites or rings or an atmosphere we're going to determine their composition we hope and learn about their geology we hope so this is a wide ranging investigation this bringing it may easing scientific firepower to bear\nAnd it sounds like science fiction you know where we have a robot four billion miles away\nI'm doing a thirty two thousand miles per hour flyby of four billion year old relic of planetary formation\nBut that's what NASA can do and that's what New Horizons is about\nDavid or are you expecting a rocky surface or do you do you have any expectations are it's just a blank slate waiting to see what you find\nWell it's a little bit of both David um we've never been to anything like this we've never been to anything so far away we never been to anything did so well preserved we know very little about it\nYou know with Pluto we knew a fair amount going and we knew there had an atmosphere we knew its basic surfaced opposition we knew spirit had five satellites that we knew what their orbits were for example well with ultimate about all we know is something about the size and shape and the space telescope measured it's color and tells us that it's reddish\nAnd that's about it so we're going in with eyes wide open we'll see now you know the answer your question a little more specifically when we don't expect to find liquid on the surface for example yes we expect to find a solid surface but we don't know what kind of land forms will be there we don't know what kind of details\nOn the surface will present it's for example crevices or false or craters on the surface it'll provide windows into the interior did it ever had activity did it ever develop its own geology or is it simply a relative of a ancient planetary formation did it ever have an atmosphere\nHow many minutes as it currently have it might be ... than it might be a whole swore\nA so this is pure exploration and as I said no one's been anything like this\nWe won't know much about it until we get to New Year's eve but starting New Year's eve and then for weeks and in fact for months as we download the data will be learning more and more about ultima and this whole new class of objects out in the corporate belt\nOr for the first time and over a period of many months\nAllen I Can't help myself I have to ask about Pluto because there's so much no unknown about ultimate tool like\nThere was the suggestion that Pluto has underground ocean systems two years old now and they're an update you can give us a have you got certainty or uncertainty about the possibility of conditions that would be conducive to life as we know on Pluto\nThat's holding up it turns out that while the most exciting discoveries that I'm\nA that the New Horizons a data can bear on ah the possibility that Pluto has a deep underground liquid water ocean\n[noise] ah we have circumstantial evidence for it in that case is not only held up its strengths and all over time and a Mendez or scientific team now has more results\nThat I uh I Can't divulge because they haven't been accepted for publication that really strengthen this story an ad details to what the opposition to that ocean maybe so uh\nWe'll see what opposition to that ocean maybe [noise] so uh I think we're going to need it orbiter around Pluto in the twenties thirties for example to go back and really ... that ocean and the fascinating geology of Pluto it used to make more progress but new arises really wet are apathetic\nSums up to orbit or thumbs up to land or Dr Alan Stern

it increases predictability a supply and ed it provides additional opportunities for for a wider I'm ... to benefit from this resources\nAnd Bulgaria needs energy to grow all countries need energy to grow and it's not obvious where they're going to gain that except from well there are competitors ... there's Russian gas and there's a competency gas and it's good to have multiple choice so\nThis relationship the strategic relationship between Bulgaria\nAnd as far as young makes sense for energy what about the military cooperation how does that work out of about ...\n[noise] well as far as the military partnership is concerned about ... an important NATO member and does it by John is a a one of the key partners and our geography for NATO's partnership for peace program\nThat's why we are I'm very much closely cooperating will Bulgaria within NATO bilateral and of course within NATO given different training smothering\nUm corporation and recently we hosted a huge exhibition in Azerbaijan that some of the trip fair the biggest in the region\nAnd it drew two hundred and twenty four companies from twenty nine countries\nUh it's called eight it's odd X. two thousand Eighteen in Bulgaria and I'm a minister of defense was also there with the big teams so we're looking at different opportunities and possibilities to work in the field because we as a country we are very much proud to be able to uh be the most reliable\nAnd secure a neighbor or a predictable neighbor or not only for our immediate neighbors but also when they talk about why did like the region in fact it doesn't go down to the budget to such\nAnd the Bulgaria is very much interested in Azerbaijan capabilities and of course is already tried its own\nRight because ... Georgia and the ... job and that is the black sea bass and final detail here we have about a minute ...

basically then do the European Union and that's why I'm there is a common for security policy and that is important also vulgarity and the European Union has any clue 'cause they supported ... out

unfortunate\nAnd it would bring prosperity to the people who Armenia who at this point are not participating in the bounty of the energy pipelines so we've been talking about\nAbsolutely a look we are

I'm ... I'm really impressed by the security that there was not a leak\nWell David Grey who was considered the father of the tunnel really made it a his job to keep the the intelligence on on the tunnel very limited\nIn the meantime they're preparing for their escape which is going to be when the rye field returns because they need that cover what else do they need to prepare\nWell here's the thing I mean all of them had been out before all had been recaptured they realize now it holds men in that I wasn't enough to get beyond the well you had to get to the home run you needed to get all the way\nAbout a hundred and fifty mile hundred and fifty miles which is no easy they're ... they're much farther from\nThe ... they need for rivers um they need food they need compasses they need maps are in many cases they need a ruse ah to get past village\nOr they asked somebody that's going to take them about Fifteen days if they're lucky Fifteen\nDays yeah on on without food right yes very hard marching and there will undoubtedly be a man on for them\nSo we're preparing uniforms I think a raft point at one point where it's two sets of clothes because he's got to strip out the outer set and then be a civilian\nCorrect rap weren't probably had the most efficient at the ... his plan was to take a train all the way to Holland\nYes rap or near a genius I liked your straightforward and uh you don't you don't read for the hall and bore you take the train the long way around where the Germans don't look there are incidents that we need to mention here in June or men by the name but ... who's my nominee for Steve McQueen\nAnd his bunk made Walter make an escape not from Holtzman didn't budge from another camp back called dark I Believe correct what happens\nWhile the skates holds men then transferred out tobacco birthdays skated again uh ... what's been called the the Houdini escape artist and he was just constantly getting out\nAnd the Germans were fed up with him and so they um medical costs you hear all the men the cops an absolute hero and he he and Walter or or um basically just shot in the in the woods in stat multiple times ordered by the\n... borders by to comment on any any trial after where no trial and we don't know who the guards were shot someone ban that\nWe do not ah their bodies were eventually recovered but I'm not as about all we\nKnow wholesome into new this happens they all the camps knew they knew\nIt happened and in fact they also knew and other camps that they had been at a one time or a tunnel esque escape or two officers came out of the tunnel they were shot when emerging from the tunnel so they knew this was very risky business\nAnd that Niemeyer could shoot them just as well and they kept digging July twenty first um is the day that they reached the rye field they there's a shortfall they keep getting fat they reached the rye field on July twenty first and they want to go out immediately so when we come back\nThe tunneled into the
