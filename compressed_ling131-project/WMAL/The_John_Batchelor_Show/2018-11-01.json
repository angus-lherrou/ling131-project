Trump and he was wearing America had new saying that he was thinking freely all of which is totally fine but as I tweeted as soon as he started doing this\nLive by the ... die by the cognac Kanye West is not a stable figure is not somebody who decided to become a an ideological conservative after reading that combined works well enough Buckley in Russell Kirk\nKanye West is a guy who sort of says whatever is on his mind that day well that resulted in a reverse on Twitter yesterday he is not rejected President Trump or written to President Trump\nBut he started tweeting out about sort of his political leanings now is that I support creating jobs and opportunities for people who need them the most I support prison reform I support commonsense gun laws that will make our roads safer and then he continued he said\nI support those who risk their lives to serve and protect us and I support holding people who used their power accountable I Believe in love and compassion for people seeking asylum and parents are fighting to protect their children from violence and war Elvis sounds like a stump speech and then he gets to the point\nHe finally he finally to eat out I introduce Kansas oh and the ... the the black\nConservative who was associated with with ... moved to the right\nI introduce candidate for the person who made the logo and they didn't want their name on it so she use mine I never wanted any association with blessed that I have nothing to do with it some blacks it is a movement that ... that can this has been pushing and Charlie Kirk has been pushing to get black folks to leave the Democratic party\nAnd in announcing blacks that Candace suggested that the logo for blacks it was designed by Kanye West he obviously does not feel that way and he's upset about it and he pointed out my eyes are now wide open and now realize had been used to spread messages I don't believe in ...\nAnd distancing myself from politics and completely focusing on being creative\nSo ouch and also ouch\nSo that's not good but when you bet on people who are not the most stable people in the world and you pretend that they are deeply stable\nThis is a not unpredictable consequences I think it's fair to say that is not the least predictable consequence that has ever happened in human history fortunately that was not the the ... story of the day the dumbest story of the day came courtesy of a guy named Jacob war I mean explain the story to you in just a second because it is too wild and ridiculous\nFor me to forego ... of all days we'll just go in just a second

story about folks who are trying to think Robert Mueller they're very upset with Robert Mueller and they believe that Robert Mueller is somehow\nIt deeply compromise how's he can't run as well he's compromise because it investigating Trump and therefore there was a scheme to find women and pay them to lie about being sexually assaulted by Robert Mueller\nI could you not according to the Daily Beast scheme became public on Tuesday when Robert Mueller staff only ask the FBI launched an investigation into the matter\nFor weeks it's been simmering below the surface with numerous reporters haven't been tipped off by a woman who claims you even approach with promises of cash at the center of this game is publicity hungry Republican lobbyist Jack Bergman who's repeatedly dabbled in Internet conspiracy theories in the past\nIncluding promoting the idea that murder DNC staffer south rich was killed by deep state government operatives Berkman denied involvement in any attempt to pay people to frame or its use Muller but he also claimed witness as we are going to expose the special counsel as a sexual harasser you scheduled day Thursday press conference a Holiday Inn\nIn northern Virginia to introduce his first accuser\nNumber one if you ever are are attempting to\nLaunch incredible fashion some sort of accusation you should upgrade from the holiday and just a recommendation there we are in the parking lot of motel six\nBoys always left on for you and good luck with that that's not the part that is a Berkman says we're going to prove that Robert Mueller as he drunk and a sexual abuse or\nYeah sure you are but that's not the part that's best the best part is that Berkman apparently hired I I he hired a in intel agency in intel agency that was that was supposed to investigate\nRobert Mueller and his effort to dig up dirt on the other Berkman appears to enlisted outside help Jacob wall is that right wing put her personality who is treated inane things for years about mad mad that President Trump\nHe's a self described ... when he said Berkman had told him he'd hired Matthew Cohen who claims to be a managing partner at the private investigation company surefire intelligence to assist with the investigation\nOnly one problem who is Matthew calling who is Matthew and\nMatthew calling as it turns out is Jacob all\nOkay and Jacob well apparently set up a bunch of fake linked in account for people who work for surefire intelligence by grabbing all these just random pictures from the Internet and using them as employee pictures for his take business\nSo for example he ... he said that the investigator was named Donald tree horn again as a stock photograph of an actor and he just use that and then when I was in the ... and then the television station chief he called the ... have\nOnly one problem that's a picture of ... the ... the Israeli supermodel\nSo he he he went through all this trouble I feel bad for him all that he went through all this trouble to create a big business to hide what he was doing from the government and then he went\nAnd got pictures of actors and use them\nAs his fake employees a financial investigator surefire intelligence is supposedly a guy named Simon ... who is Simon ... a picture of Christoph Waltz surprise salad higher there [laughter]\nI got the guy from Inglourious Basterds to be the financial investigator ensure fire intelligence pretty and I mean Chris Walton in Inglourious Basterds does have a good record and tracking people down but I mean my goodness\nApparently the deputy director of operations for sure fire intelligence is Dr Mike hardening of the first Baptist church of Troy, Michigan so well done this is the best part of it is at wool was asked about all this and he denied all of that and then it turns out that he registered the website\nUnder the name under the phone number of his mother\nThis is what the Daily Beast and saying so if I should say our politics is too crazy people have been driven out of their minds short fires website domain data listen email address during wolves name and then of a legally suspect financial firm he held next management surefire as website also contains images uploaded to the same Google Cloud account\nWall who ended at the Miller investigations on Monday Night night any involvement\nIn or knowledge of surefire he said he works for an influence marketing company in LA\nYeah turns out that I'm not so much so\nYes things are crazy out there and everybody needs to calm down now that did not end the crazy yesterday there was a lot of crazy yesterday my favorite bit of crazy actually was that even that it came courtesy of Joe ... and this was late breaking crazy last night Joe Donnelly is he Democratic Senate candidate in Indiana is the current senator in Indiana and\nHe was in a debate when he started trying to describe this\nOnly if he Democratic Senate candidate in Indiana is the

N. A. L. Washington comes to Don\nDon with Gordon Chang were very pleased to welcome Scott Harold full political scientist deputy director at the center for Asia Pacific policy at the RAND Corporation\nScott it's a pleasure to speak to you and Gordon guides me immediately we are eager for your thoughts about the meeting between the prime minister of Japan all day\nAnd the prime minister of India ... Modi\nThey are two parts of what is called the Indo Pacific Claude India\nJapan Australia and the United states all day and and Modi both share democracies are they both have aggressive modern warships what are they what are they what are they looking to do with each other and how does how do they regard China collectively good evening to\nGood evening John and Gordon and to your listeners around the world John I'm very happy Halloween to all of you um you know it's a good point John the or the Japanese and the Indians share both are common values\nAnd also a common threat perception there is a view that is very widely held in both Tokyo and in India\nAh that China's aggressive build up its military capabilities and its use of both military\nAnd economic tools as well as its diplomacy are coming at these countries expense including the region in a bit of a danger where uh it's possible Beijing may use coercion and ... on toward influence to try to put these countries\nNational security at risk so you saw the prime minister of Japan visit Beijing where he ... late last week\nThe very next day he was back in Tokyo and met with prime minister Modi at the foot of mount Fuji where he invited him to his private residence and signed a host of deals on announced a number of other initiatives all designed to signal a very strong bilateral relationship between Tokyo in New Delhi\nGordon Scott you mentioned that a prime minister of Abyei hosted the Indian prime minister at his private home and\nAt the base of mount Fuji um what struck me about all this is that uh when I went to Beijing did it just seemed a little bit stiff of the meeting city had in the Chinese capital\nBut to his relations with Modi were very warm and and this strikes me is is not just the personal relationship but as you point out\nI'm In Japan and India seeing a common interest um if you could talk a little bit about the the warmth of the relationships that has had with Modi and the significance of going forward for\nSure yeah I think there is no doubt you know the\nThe Japanese generally and the prime minister in particular\nDo feel a a a very strong sense of shared identity as a democratic country and Asian democracy that has legitimately embraced and built its own version of democracy and and that shows through and the personal relations between\nThe prime minister and his Indian counterpart but also between other Japanese officials and their Indian counterparts what's that oversell this working with India is still recognized in Japan to work in progress very promising but it has been very promising for a long time so it is\nWith India is still recognized in Japan to eat a work in progress very promising but it has been very promising for a long time so it is not always easy and as you've seen they have been negotiating arms sales and other types of defense cooperation\nFrom quite a number of years it's not necessarily the case that this confluence of interest in threat perceptions immediate you lead us to resolve that one might hope\nBut there is a great sense of optimism that at least the direction is the right one and that they can build a closer relationship by contrast the Japanese recognize that China's in a very difficult place right now I Believe your previous guest just outlined some of the economic difficulties China's facing they're also of course facing a difficult relationship with\nThe American administration and the recent election in Brazil is likely to put even further pressure on Beijing such Japan recognize that China's outreach now is almost entirely tactical it's an attempt to alleviate pressure on Beijing\nNot genuinely motivated by any change in thinking of by Beijing about the grand strategic relationship it wants to have with Japan\nAnd similarly the Japanese recognize that and say okay we'd be happy to work more closely with you on terms that we can accept but we're not going to wreck we're not going to believe that this represents any kind of a sea change or a permanent solution to the problems that led us to the difficult place where they were in the two sides were in over the last several years\nScott were told there is a ... a Indo Pacific region Claude India Australia Japan and the United states is that aspirational or is that actual\nI think it's a great question John you know I I Do think that this was an aspirational about a dozen years ago at that time a there is the four side there was not entirely\nA confluence of a belief that China posed a challenge or a threat today I think that is much more strongly recognized and held as of view and all four capitals I Will say though that uh there continues to be\nA need to build a practical meat around the bones of the quandary lateral dialogue and grouping\nOf course do do some military exchanges of exercises and in fact the recent visit by the Indian prime minister to to pan has led to an upgrading in India Japan defense ties with\nMore regular eyes high level contacts including a two plus two dialogue but formally been announced where the Japanese and Indian foreign and defense ministers will meet\nAnd the two sides will work more closely to invest in\nCapabilities that are dual use including a code developing a artificial intelligence and robotics and working more closely or in male male exchanges but to be sure there is much much work left to do and it would be premature to say that the quad has reached its full potential\nGordon Scott you know I listen to you describe the relationship between Japan and India one could say many of the same things between India and the United states it's a great relationship but it's got a long long way to go I mean do you see any parallels they're all absolutely\nI mean I think that the reality with India is it is a country with enormous potential\nUh and unfortunately also enormous obstacles to realizing the full measure of that potential\nUh India continues to have a large amount of\nAttachment to its previous or and continues to have a non aligned policy or a policy that cherishes autonomy and devoid of any kind of a formal alliance relationship with any other country that is in some ways quite limiting of course India also has a large number of captured or vested interests in its\nDefense industrial base as well as the broader economy that kind of complicate\nBlock or at least make difficult any sort of the deepening of a really meaningful deepening of economic ties including defense industrial ties so\nI Do think there are a lot of parallels I think that the good thing here is that the U.S and Japan is very close allies are working very closely to try to encourage the Indians to find ways to uh work within their system to try to put pressure\nOr from the outside a welcome pressure pressure that new tally can used to say look we want to do this with the Americans and the Japanese and in order to cooperate more deeply we need to make some changes domestically\nIn the Japanese context as you know Gordon this used to be referred to end is still referred to as guy out two or useful foreign pressure that kind of pressure can help India to\nMake forward progress on kind of breaking up some of the cartel like structures and its domestic economy and opening up so they can capture some of the real dynamism that exist in India is highly educated extremely skilled workforce that is unfortunately still in some cases are trapped in the ... industry structure that persist amount of common in some places\nGot

[noise]\n\nIn that same island pulled the Peace Corps out within the last couple of years now the Peace Corps been I'm In my car in Asia since almost the beginning of the Peace Corps so um I think the question that we were we were saying or is it a\n... most of these nations want us there um there are accepting of uh the Chinese investment and may investments in there and for infrastructure but I think their preference would be to have the United states there a with a little bit more of a presence there and I don't think we need to\nMeet them on that scale I think there are ways that we can be helpful to them in terms of technology and other\nA smaller initiatives that to give them a sort of force multiplier is and I'll give you an example in Fiji [noise] um the Australian government help define day fusion center there for the ... navy where they're able to see and have a sort of real time understanding of the ships that are coming in and out of their\nTheir fishery zones and they're able to understand which which of those ships are actually registered and legal to fish there and which ones are clearly not and which ones are questionable and that allows them to\nUse the whatever forces they have in terms of patrol boats to go to the places where there might be trouble and that's a that's a modest investment that goes a long way in terms of building goodwill\nBetween Australia and history and government which are who are friends there and I really also very present it in the region and uh with some of the island nations that don't have that kind of resources to [noise] to invest in that type of capability\nThe ... speaks to the Indo Pacific region no longer just the Pacific and it also speaks of the quad\nUm organized India Japan Australia and the United states and India Japan Australia and the United states did you see ... did you see the the the places we visited\nLooking to hear from Japan and India and Australia how can they joined in this partnership to provide security and freedom\n[noise] um well I Would say that uh and and my visits and almost every place I went I did meet someone from Australia uh either\nFrom Australia navy or certainly in government consulates a Japanese as well so there there is a presence there for certain um\nI don't think the Indians have arrived as much on the scene yet but not not to say that they're not just an I encounter\nThem when I was there and his dad something the U.S navy a can work with in other words we've been\nWe've been uh the Decatur incident in the south China Sea or the two warships to the Taiwan Strait and the Chinese challenging it directly I understand the British warship apt to the Pacific the Australians have warships there\nCan those warships or at least the personnel from those warships reassure Oceana that they're not to be left alone\n[noise] oh I think I think we definitely can I mean that is one thing that came up everywhere we went was they would like to have more ship is it's I'm\nNot just for the sense of security but also just to demonstrate our our ah our interest and those nations the the cultural exchange that happens when our sailors come ashore [noise] uh the opportunity to get to know is better to sort of have either I interaction with the people I think is something that they really really value and\nFrankly we've we've not done as much of that because for a variety of variety of reasons we have high end warships that have high end missions and operational requirements for those missions has not subsided so we have to think about different ways that they are where we can establish that presidents were\nLooking at ways that we can possibly get our\nHospital ships out there again a to do more frequent visits that's another thing that they really really appreciate and helps build a lot of good will so I think we have to\nWe can't really I don't think we can really play a whack a mole strategy here I think we have to become use our creativity and become a little more asymmetric and and uh advance our interests there using some of the values that we share with a lot of these nations\nI'm speaking with the under secretary of the

Center for politics and it says has created\nIs it you can see an snapshot fashion how he is being dragged down by other factors kind of within his party\nI'm the first one being that we in his suburban um district that Trump approval rating is twenty nine percent I'm so that is a good\nYou know sort of twelve to Thirteen percent below the national average for President Trump and there's no

he been has very little to do other than to emphasize the trumps in every headline is that the campaign Lara\nWell I think so certainly I Would imagine that he is trying to create distance from Brian

sort of one of the members of Congress who's engage in um essentially what's called the problem solvers caucus so\nHe is somebody who is kind of modeled this notion of we should be civil work across

suburban districts in the country will go and so this is certainly one to watch and it's one\nIn the east you know a poll closing time in Pennsylvania I Believe is eight o'clock\nI'm Virginia will close at seven um but we will have a sense of really where this is going when we look at a seat like this on election night and we look at a seat like I'm Barbara Comstock in Virginia\nThis has Pennsylvania where the Supreme Court re district between the last election in this election uh this district ... in a slightly different configuration was plus nine four Brock Obama an older age plus two for bronco bombing twelve and plus two for Hillary Clinton\nIn sixteen so would with a Republican as representative so it's a perfect target for the Democrats if they're to move the needle back to their side of the majority are let's go to the larger map\nThe conventional wisdom last week when we talk was that the\nDemocrats take the house somewhere between twenty three I'm forty feet a pickup which would give them majority and the Republicans hold the Senate possibly up to pick up has anything moved in the last week\nUm I don't think so I mean there is this question about whether or not\nThe Texas race between Beto O'Rourke and an incumbent Senator Ted Cruz is essentially narrowing and becoming more competitive there was a poll out today that suggested that the distance between them was more\nLike three percentage points and\nNot a six percentage points I think that's going to be um very much a function of turnout and then there's also this question of how much immigration versus health care\nReally plays in sort of the important states states like North Dakota where\nThe incumbent Democrat Heidi Heitkamp is trying to um secure reelection where Joe mansion in West Virginia is trying to secure his reelection um those are the states where really this question of\nWill the presidents um desire to focus on the caravan and illegal immigration\nAnd asylum seekers or will um the Democrats desire to focus on the need to protect pre existing conditions and support the um Affordable Care act that's what will matter\nLara Brown is a political scientist she's also professor George, Washington university and we're looking at a website political hyphen atlas dot com with a great deal of detail I mean it's just granular to the nth degree so if you're a geek like me you can stare at this on a lecture night\nThe district we been talking about his first Pennsylvania Scott Wallace who was raised and norm is amount of money compared to his\nHe's raised Thirteen million dollars he has two million on hand as opposed to Brian Fitzpatrick who's raised only three million dollars in comparison to that used to be a lot of money in the first district and he only as less than half a million dollars on the hand in hand so that this is an example of how the Democrats have overwhelmed the Republican\nDistrict and he only as less than half a million dollars on the hand in hand so that this is an example of how the Democrats have overwhelmed the Republican with fund raising in this cycle I'm John ... this is the John ...

[noise]\n[noise]\nIsn't time rather miraculously competent to run a system that he doesn't understand and the great insight from the ... tradition\nIs that prices get information about good worth without having to do detailed inquiries as to whether the people think do or want it makes it an exchange system rather than an administrative system it's more ... it's more responsive and in the end it works better for everybody the\nPresident's council of economic advisors Richard has that linked to the report has issued the opportunity costs of socialism Richard is giving the overview very quickly we're going to plunge into this\nBecause democratic socialism does not make common sense period\nHowever it's important to pull it apart on the basis of what it believes the historical precedent that would be the nineteenth century\nAnd the language of Carl Marx as inherited by the man who you know we call Lenin or the definitions Richard applies in his defining ideas beside never looked at them as closely as I did and Richard definition because they don't make any sense on the one hand we have\nA definition of socialism that includes these words regulated by the committee as a whole what the heck is that I asked myself the other definition we have is collective ownership of the means of production what the heck is that I asked myself\nAnd then the updated version this is for the twenty first century by those who call themselves democratic socialism Megan Megan day is richer citation pooling societies resources to make people's basic needs what the heck does that mean\nI think Richard the language here is so inexact\nIt's dumb founding because it doesn't have history and when we offer examples you just did with Venezuela we can talk about you but we can certainly talk about what happened to Russia\nWhen we offer historical examples in which they shuffle aside and say now now that was failure we're going to do it right Richard I do not believe that we can do we can debate with people who don't do history\nI certainly won't be able to do it right but let's just go back to the analytics of the points I any serious activity requires joint cooperation either through exchange or to corporate businesses are corporations but when you start talking about a collective ownership of a from\nThese are so but then the five people who pick their friends put together and then when they do is they put together goods to sell to the world or shares that they could sell the other people and everybody knows the business that they're buying from or the business that they're buying into so the collective ownership is a way of combining labor and improving productivity\nWhen you say the collective means of production are owned by the government that when it when and sorting process no longer takes quite so which of the three hundred and twenty five million people in the United states are going to be at the\nHelm of which fences and why is going to be determined solely by a political process all political processes of these terms turn out to be completely unstable because what happens if somebody gets in gets elected and\nAppointed friends in cronies to take these jobs over there is nobody who can discipline them I say I'm not going to invest in your particular business\nBecause I don't have a decent business plan so they do is a big tax money\nAnd then they put it to ventures and they have no idea what to make her how to make it or why to make it so the system essentially um this fused responsibility\nLeads to nobody controlling anything which is not going to last very long or to these arbitrary groups coming in and taking over segments of the economy without the consent of the people who invest and so if you ask a simple question can this collective pulled asset\nPlan and work with government control the answer is no now the government have a role in regulating the economy as one of the things that you never hear talked about among socialist is how is that regulation actually does make sense\n[laughter] and I'm thinking here of common carrier regulation like public utilities and railroads way you do know what you're trying to do\nOh is that regulation actually does make sense [laughter]\nAnd I'm thinking here of common carrier regulation like ... and railroads way you do know what you're trying to do which is to control the use of monopoly power\nAs it would otherwise they exist by putting in a set of rates that leave enough money to the firms so it doesn't go broke but prevents those excesses this is a very hard road to follow but at least you know what the message is well they're\nTalking about government regulation they're not trying to talk about reaching some kind of competitive ideal they have no respect for Marcus no us back for competition no respect for the fundamentals theory of economics which is that competitive solutions cannot be\nTopped by any arbitrary solutions you put into place so the only question is when you can't have competitive market say good capitalist is willing to think about limited regulations to create it but when you can have competitive markets the last thing you want to do is to have the socialist come along\nAnd rectum by taking over all the means of production\nI'm speaking with Richard abstain at the Hoover Institution and he's a senior fellow he also teaches law at NYU and the University of Chicago we're dealing with the Democratic socialism idea of the campaign trail turning Eighteen\nTheir people to put a plug into this when we come back we're going to speak to Elizabeth Warren and her concept of collective ownership of a corporation and how that works with the older concept of central planning I'm John bachelor this is the John
