nationalism are no exception Mazie Hirono center from Hawaii when President Trump says that he's a national she says maybe it's because he's a white supremacist or an anti Semite\nWe should stop giving him the benefit of the doubt that he doesn't understand what he means when he refers to nationalist or\nAny of these other terms that these are not just dog whistles that it's so hard it's racism is basically for many people and it's a um anti semantic as white supremacy he knows very well what he's talking about even if he professes otherwise\nOkay amazing my antenna is pretty high up there for for anti Semitism when the president says nationalism\nI'm not hearing Nazi thing that he prioritize the United states is border security over the human rights of people trying to make their way across the board you may disagree with that and there is no way that that has anything to do with racism or anti Semitism but this became the actual talking point across luck yesterday\nJim Acosta CNN and waiting to find you somebody who loves you like him a cost of loved him some Costa there is going to cost us saying well maybe when President Trump says national it's he means white nationalist\nOr maybe when Jemma costs us that stuff I just think that he's an idiot Hiroshima Costa\nWhen you're demonizing middle Easterners they're making the suggestion that they're they're terrorists and so on Medicare run without offering any proof and then call yourself a nationalist in front of thousands and thousands of people I don't think it's a stretch for a lot of Americans out there to wonder whether or not the president is secretly considering himself a white nationalist\nSo much journal is making so much objective journalism in there from Jim Acosta only if anyone or that people ask whether the president has announced he when he when he says things like we should protect our borders and nationalism I mean flashback to block Obama two thousand five thing exactly the same thing the ...\nActually had this right here is Obama circuit two thousand five when he was just a senator barely a glimpse in the nation's I there he was saying exactly the same thing Donald Trump\nVery generous and welcoming people here in the United states but those who federally legally and those who are for them just respect the rule of law\nAnd they are showing disregard for those who were born\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented bunk shirt circumventing the line if you were waiting patiently diligently unlawfully does become immigrants in this country\nOkay so uh you know again that I get that rock Obama way back when was that sort of white nationalist also you know being half white I get the he was white nationalist as well it wasn't just down the cost I who at this point basically everything that he says to me preface with gear diary\nBecause he does all the quiet stuff out loud it was also anything you can get around that are more objective journalism being from the mainstream media on the issue of nationalism\nYeah it definitely does mean undertones or not just racial ... says something to the presence and sort of shied away from it in the past obviously nationalism was the phrase the ban in a fog assumed brace over the course of the campaign and a lot of the president's opponents tried to pin this idea on him\nNow with it I'm somebody who is that that I prefer patriotism to nationalism I don't think the national isn't alone is enough I think there are ties that bind us it has a history and culture but what actually make the United states the United states\nBut he has said that I prefer patriotism to nationalism I don't think the national isn't alone is enough I think there are tied the mind that it has a history of culture but\nWhat actually make the United states the United states is the root idea embedded in the declaration of independence and the constitution back by two thousand years of Judeo Christian History or rather three thousand years in jail Christian History and that's what makes the United states the United states is the idea of classical liberalism combined with cultural conservatism and that's what makes the United states you need\nAt ... doing ... putting making their faces black and giving themselves big lip in really really racist fashion and then singing Miami songs in order to mock laptops\nAnd it's very much the same thing as an anti Semitic cultures for centuries where people would put on a hook knows a and they and they put on a big belly and currently sidewalks and then they would suggest that they were Jewish right I mean it it's the same sort of thing like dressing up their culture to mock that culture is discussing unacceptable actually racer\nNow is that will make until it was interesting this is what we're getting to the issue\nAssuming people's motives here's my opinion on people darkening their face for costumes like that\nAgree that it's inappropriate specifically because of the past and I think that it is fair for people to look at this sort of thing and be sensitive about it but I think it would also be worthwhile to recognize there is a difference between being ignorant slash racially insensitive and being racist\nNowhere was making Kelly suggesting\nThat black people should be mocked no or was making Kelly suggesting that black people are inferior in any way in fact are making Kelly was interesting is that maybe white people want to dress up as some famous black people because they admire those famous black people that is not the same thing as people dressing up in blackface now again that doesn't mean that it's okay to go to a frat party dressed as a black person with black makeup on\nMy that's insensitive and you should take into account black people's feelings about historic use of this sort of costuming for mockery\nBut I also think there's a difference between even a frat boy going to a party and a little girl who decided that she wants to dress up as Michelle Obama and so she puts on dark make up\nBecause I think that you can pretty easily tell the difference in noted the attempt to miss it from the motives in our society is really gross Megan Kelly is not a racist and making it was not attempting to be racist by that statement at best and worst worst Megan Kelly was being ignorant of the history of blackface and the impact that still has on black folks in the United states\nThat's the worst habit there is no way to Megan Kelly was actually suggesting it's okay to mock black people\nThat is not what was happening here and yet here is CNN's Don Lemon suggesting that Megan Kelly actually is a racist because there's never been a time when black face was acceptable first of all he doesn't know where she was he doesn't know what kind of party she went to like download it doesn't do that\nSo it isn't just an isn't making Kelly was racist when she was seven years old because you dress up is Diana Ross and black interface for it\nI Would suggest the gum and doesn't really know what he's talking about you may know what he's talking about historically with regard to black face but again there's a difference between darkening your face for a costume to praise and African American person and darkening your face you mock African American people\nAnd I said several times in the segment I still don't think they should do it to praise African American people specifically because there are too many black folks are going to look at that and say well maybe your mocking you maybe the real reason you're doing that is because you're mocking these out of sensitivity you shouldn't do that but\nThe attempt to immediately attribute the worst of scalable motive to Megan Kelly is really telling and it says something about the nastiness of our politics right now\n... million to forty seven years old she's already it's fair has never been a time\nTo mess with her forty seven years that blackface has been acceptable [noise] um they're all white people on that panel\nThere were no African Americans do people of color there to say hey Megan\nCool okay so this is this is really really absurd you know again\nIt is and then taking blackface seriously is fine but misinterpreting motive is not I'll give you an example you want to you know you wonder how we should deal with these issues really how was your dad will do the same way the Jamie Fox deals with these issues that gave me ...\nWas it you know it is obviously an incredibly prominent black man in the United states made lots of money as a musician as an actor very talented guy he is very close friends with Robert Downey junior a few years ago he did a pod casting Joe Rogan and in the middle of his podcast the question of Robert Downey junior actually putting on black face for the movie Tropic Thunder came up\nRobert Downey junior was nominated for best supporting actor Oscar there is no way by the way that even\nThe I think what most Tropic Thunder made maybe ten years ago eight years ago maybe eight years ago in any case there is no way that movie gets made even today because of the great sensitivity around identity politics but here is Jamie Fox is perfectly decent\nExplanation of Robert Downey junior and how he feels about all those\nPeople have to understand where it comes from there are real people that did a really mean you have\nLike outside of us I mean there's some groupie really doing much whatever you are whether you're black you why you're viewed history you're gay or whatever it is there's some people who really doing\nWe're in agreement and it's easy were easy targets\nSo when when Jamie Fox\nAnd people were really doing we're in agreement and it's easy were easy targets\nOkay so when when Jamie Fox suggest you have to know where it's coming from there are some people who are bad out there who don't like it or Robert Downey junior is not one of those people why don't we start thinking of each other as people who probably couldn't be friends if we would stop treating each other like garbage\nAnd Maine Kelly is not going to a party dressed in blackface my black people and it's kind of amazing how certain people get away with this sort of stuff because everybody assumes the best motives on their part so for example\nTom Hanks in two thousand four was at a fundraiser and that that fundraiser there was a comedian who died I was there was one fray and he was actually making jokes well we're in blackface when he was actually dark in this day and he was wearing a freight wig and Tom Hanks was cool with that\nAnd the controversy laughing about five minutes because Tom Hanks said listen that never should have happened it was inappropriate I don't know what was going on there I understand people were offended everybody said right Tom Hanks dozens of race as we know he didn't mean to mop black people we know that he's not interested in taking it in in somehow hurting black people and everybody got on with their lives\nBut because we are interested in right now in what can we can people to the wall over that makes for the worst available country the worst version of ourselves and that has to stop whether we are talking about making Kelly or whether we're talking about President Trump or whether we are talking about the the attempt to nail people on the other side of the aisle and in ...\nOkay I'm going to talk a little bit more about this for someone to talk about the latest on the care of an issue in just a second and plus there's some breaking news on the return address of the suspicious packages\nBut first let's talk about the fact that you are going to die I Know\nDark thoughts are thoughts today but the fact is that if you haven't thought about that you probably also haven't thought about getting life insurance and you ought to have life insurance just as they responsible human being\nNow maybe you thought about life insurance but it's kinda hard to buy because you have to work out what you need to do the research to find the best quote\nHope we don't get swindled well that's why you need policy genius policy genius compares quotes from the top lights insurance companies\nAnd they find the best policy for you it takes for two minutes to get a quote if you don't know anything about

in fact over four million people have used policy genius to shop for insurance\nPolicy genius doesn't just do life insurance either they also do disability insurance home insurance auto insurance\nIf

to make an informed decision for you and your loved one policy genius is indeed the easy way to compare and by life insurance policy genius dot com go check it out right now let them know that you\nOkay so the the update with regard to these bonds that there was a return address that was put on the labels Debbie Wasserman Schultz has off at that doesn't mean that Debbie Wasserman Schultz is actually sending these bombs and means that somebody is probably trolling by doing exactly that okay so I Want to talk a little bit\nAbout a little bit more about you know where we are at the society and how we how we care all of this again we need to start with the premise that the people that we are talking about generally do not have harm in mind that their goal is not to destroy us in any way if we figure that then we can have normal elections yes fraught heated elections but\nWe're not going to be trying to kill each other because\nWe can assume that most people in the United states grew up in the same dealt with the same guy says when we did\nAnd they did I mean the reality is we all grew up in the same value our values are not all that different even though as right wing members of the United states and most left the members of the United states theoretically agree on certain basic values like freedom of speech and hurting each other compassionate land decently\nAnd why because we all grew up in the same society when you're up in the same society you share a certain level of baseline bellies now I think that splitting I think that's one of the problem the country but one of the ways that split is exacerbated by simply assuming the political disagreement reflects underlying character differences now speaking of political disagreement\nAnd you know the polarization of our politics\nThat social fabric those common values I say are being split and you're seeing it in in some of these democratic campaign one of those campaigns from Stacey Adams use the Georgia gubernatorial candidate for the Democrats and she was caught on tape talking about free market here's what she had to say\n[laughter]\n\n\n\nHave arms if you can't hear you saying the free market has never solves any problems in the medical field which is obviously on through your baseline root issues in American politics I think Stacey Abrams is therefore lacking character no I don't think she just wrong I think she's wrong and she doesn't know enough about economics and she's misinterpreting the economics that she does know\nWhat she had bad person I don't know Stacey Abrams probably not even though they you know there's tape of her day I Believe now burning a flag back in college so I guess we've now ripping directly from script written by Aaron Sorkin like we're actually just going to do the American president all over again with Stacey Abrams\nNoticed this weird trend in the news the last couple of days like there was that there is a moved to Boston plane\nAnd like we're actually just going to do the American president all over again with Stacey Abrams I I've noticed this weird trend in the news the last couple of days like there was there they moved to Boston plane that landed on the one oh one north I got like not that far from where we filmed that\nAnd all I can say thank God for the ... because the royal Airforce really took care of business making sure the ... and so the man in a high capital is coming true bath exciting\nAnd apparently said the Abrams is directly from the American president and then there was a story that I saw today that it I could look exactly like David trimmer\nOkay well they are given that profit thing goes with any ... pointed they wish to go to and they can apply for asylum in the United states again the implication by Tom press here a little bit is that folks on the other side I don't want to treat people who are trying to cross the border illegally with dignity\nThat is inherently unfair so in essence they think of today's show and what should be the theme of our politics if we want to have serious discussion of folks on the other side we have to cut out the idea that they are inherently bad evil folks were manifesting that bad and that evil in way it's designed to destroy the country\nAll this has to stop and we don't stop it and things are going to get a lot worse before they get any better or we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest\nMaybe we'll know than the bombs that white certainly bringing up today here\nDo you what I Would watch WMA a Washington\nWashington election

N. A. L. more Washington comes to a song [noise]\nOf the Daily Beast we're looking at China China is in conflict\nWith the Trump Administration with our European allies the conflict has to do with the Chinese business plan which is piracy\nAnd China has not at this point acknowledged that it has another way piracy or else does the Chinese position well\nYou cannot lie to your own data and I'm looking at an article published recently by Jeffrey Snyder all ... investment partners and every child I'm looking at China GDP China dollar correlations China China nominal GDP China industrial production\nChina retail sales China fixed asset investment\nIt that it's that chart that only goes down\nDown now either this is a recession or China doesn't have recessions it as we're tree so I don't know what the polite word as we go to Charles are tell of Sunday's with our tell he's also an investment counselor Charles the question gardening I have for you and your crystal ball [noise]\nWhere is China in six to nine months because that's projection our markets like that's what the stock market reflects does China have an up leg to these declines good evening to\nGetting the votes thanks so much I think not unfortunately I think if you look at excellent data that's produced by un C. T. A. D. the divide all economies into their consumption their investment consider China has been inflated the largest investment bubble ever created in history [laughter]\nAnd then on top of which there's a lot of leverage nobody really knows how much that there is on the Chinese economy when you cut through it and the demand inside the country hasn't gotten to the ... worth of support all this debt so I think there's only one painful way through this and that is that destruction\nGordon Charles\nOr you know the number of countries are trying to manage their way out of crises tried to grow um problems in in China certainly falls and direct category and it seems as the article that John referred to in the beginning of the segment\nEssentially um you don't have very much upside potential for China really what it is is at best a straight line flat line gross from it just seems to me that it would have been much better for them to accept some medicine and have a crisis and then get over why aren't they doing that\nIn gross it just seems to me that it would have been much better for them to accept some medicine and have a crisis and then get over why aren't they doing that\nWell I I don't think that China really has that the long a period of a experimentation in history that we have in the west village just having lived through the many booms and busts and we can trace our modern economy that can be mid Eighteen hundreds we've had many painful depressions we've learned from some of them\nThere's just too much productive capacity in China they can sell their products and services\nAnd dumped them around the world and places like the U.S where that's not going to happen anymore so visible way through this you have to cut your capacity you have to encourage people to consume more inside your country and you gotta you gotta be forthcoming with how much debt you truly have and if it's too much just go to the guy off the mark downs and\nThere has to be a redo the Chinese financial structure\nA garden reading these charts I find I knew highlighted this to me China's retail sales don't look as bad as everything else does that make sense or they are they selling domestically\nI don't think they are John Doe their numbers tell you that they are so for instance they're saying the official national ... says the retail sales increased nine point two percent in September\n... same month a sales of automobiles so Levin point six percent\nUm vehicle sales were down the three months of full three months of the quarter and yet they're saying that a consumption is increase\nThat just doesn't make sense John especially when you start looking at the sales of other items which were also slapped or down so I think that China has a real data problem in terms of what they're reporting to people but I think it got to do that in a sense because if people really knew the truth\nThere wouldn't be panic there'll be panic it would be the end of the economy so what they're doing is they're just trying to lie and basically get their way through a very difficult patch\nI don't think they can do it this time um and then we'll just have to say\nAll right they're buying the Brooklyn Bridge every thirty five minutes a child or what what is what's in it for us does this indication of failure and I mean it's a it's a big two thousand eight here we're looking at this come our way we got defenses for their equity collapse\nI well I think fortunately yes we do I mean one very good thing that German Jay Powell for the Federal Reserve has managed to get interest rates up above three percent on the tenure\nWhich means that in awe of China collapse China\nDowndraft we have room to lower interest rates and cushion the blow compared to other economies I think we're all in much better position than any other large economy\nIt'll hurt is kind of go through this painful process economically I fear that a distraction might be suggested by the leadership there that some military adventure or whatever to distract the population that mess to pose as an order\nIs certainly a very dangerous set of months here um but in the end I think the United states even if the Republicans do not maintain control the Senate will survive the coming retrenchment far better than any other\nMajor country and gotten I'm checking with you because of this question before the Chinese Communist party capable of taking a recession because that cures that they're they they they they've missed price their economy can they take a hit I\nThink that they believe that they can't and that's the reason why they have been fighting the economy with too much cash you know as you talked about just a few seconds ago China did not go through it's two thousand that everybody else did\nAnd eventually they got to go through that and right now we're in a pretty good position because as Charles points out our interest rates have gone up we have room to move them down again and we're very icing robust period and so um you know whether China goes up or down and you know we'll be able to get through this and we'll do very\nWell earlier today Charles Gordon and I were corresponding and there was a report in the Financial Times that businesses have borrowed up to one hundred percent against their stock\nOr that they they borrowed and they give it to the bank and they borrow against it but the stock market collapsed their assets have collapsed and the central government is looking to subsidize that collapsed as long as they can ... I Believe that that is not a sustainable model that's like ... times a million correct that war that does not work\nIt certainly does not work and we really do unfortunately throughout China and the Asian and parts of Asia people do like to gamble and leverage and do it with ... money is very dangerous [noise]\nUm I Hope that our European banks which are also highly leveraged are not overly exposed to the China China best were there America because I think are pretty good shape\nBut in China collapse I think that it's like torture bank and other European banks and a blend heavily into emerging markets in China wow are they in\nTrouble and going to have you heard talked about had banks putting in defense says here so that we don't go through a weight as sad as the wave washes are way\nBy which they did um but I don't think that they really are thinking in that direction\nWe don't go through a weight is that as the wave washes are way [noise]\nI Wish they did um but I don't think that they really are thinking in that direction and John but you know clearly there is going to be some sort of adjustment and China\nProbably will be severe I think it'll be fairly soon though I could be wrong on that but it will come because China has just done too much to balance its economy since two thousand that\nCharles hotel a Sunday is with Charles Gordon Chang the Daily Beast on John ... [noise]\nAnd the beautiful thing about somebody else's I can come to you right now and put your glasses on you and tell you even though you don't do anything in the ... in virtual reality put those ... is on you and tell you this is the future and this is why the future you only fall in love with each right now which is called by the way a emotional investment\nLike they do with art sometimes and you can come to your father or your mother or whatever and say listen we got to be involved in this thing\nThe only ones that can make decisions that data family offices so I think they love they told you you see that they invest heavily into cause you to diversify the risks and they love the adventure they love to look at different kinds of ... created investments opposite of\nThe concern I have about family offices and where they're going now is the difference between here in New York\nAnd in Israel and in Europe I hear they're different tax structure of DNA I hear that around the world you have to know what you're doing your ... our people attracted to the U.S version of a family office as opposed to a European have a good question I think Europe\nIs all around the place you know just so many different cultures which is also a problem is probably number one culture wise they don't always seem to saying that don't agree\nAnd fixation that they come from different countries are different rules it makes it very hard for the call invest go invest meaning\nI Will instead of going to a fund our come to another family that says the ... states and I don't do that and I will join them in the roost in investment and that will join meanwhile I'm good at that same technology and then we'll take the middleman out and it's just us and we have the same objective [noise]\nSo in Europe I think it's way more problematic because of what I've just mentioned while the U.S is huge and people who came from the same place so convincing is way easier here than there so that's one of the major differences between the U.S and Europe\nWe had a crisis ten years ago the financial crisis to sweat the earth I've chiefly real estate failure in the United states to all of that laws were changed job and I'm thinking chiefly of Dodd Frank and other adjustments in our taxes how does that make it more or\nOr ... or more likely for a family office to profit here are less likely\nI think even more likely to because it's it's it's it's the truth in their face is what happened right you had the crisis which proved to you that ... those are just supposed to guard you and care about you don't really do that or do to some extent\nYou had made of you had a lot of made off by the way made of his one story the will many stories or what people trusted people and they got you know a damaged by it very seriously [laughter]\nSo I think they're just drove them even more so to invest to say you know what forget about these guys it's just your family I'm assembly which off one another we look at each other in the eye by the way that actually what they do\nThey want us to trust that one fifth of the family office guy told me\nI you know many tried into somebody else's segment to do a like a um an online investment vehicles and all that and try to make you know organizations like me networks make money out of it that led to make business together and let's ... summer that\nWere you know ... wherever that is legal and it's never worked for nobody because I don't know some of these one to ... each other in the eye and that's important because that's a lot of the trust\nAnd and the you know they they they can feel by just seeing you if you're somebody they want to talk to\nAnd so I think they do even more corn resting up after those years or money was lost by scam or by you know [noise]\nYou R D the hype and finance dot com in future you're going to have a Vance events about certain investment opportunities for family offices\nWhere you come back and visit with me when you have those events so we can focus on something you're going to present to people who are interested you can contact you we do that sure because again I've been preached to for years\nBy my friend John ten\nPay attention to wealth job that's where the jobs come from you know when they cut the taxes on businesses the jobs girl in the United states [noise]\nSo I look upon family officers and you taught me that they're the ones who take the\nDanny ... is\nD the hyphen finance dot com I'm John bachelor this is the John Belushi\nThe Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government secrets that the United states has\nAnd the Russians have hacked our elections are infrastructure our government secrets of the United states has master hackers to the best one of the CIA cyber age who defies all notions of what a deadly spy looks like\n... new album from done books as bite B.

private get along with the regulation for the boom and the economy these last month in court or is it was actually a tax\nHike I think that's right it's not quite logical but I built kind of helped me bill how does the Democratic candidates Mikey Cheryl how does she maintain a straight face when she says that the tax cut was a tax hike how does it work good evening to you about\nWell it works its way John or as you know that one of the more controversial aspects of the tax cuts was to a cap\nDeductions for state local taxes and mortgages right [noise] and uh I Am a long suffering taxpayer of New Jersey Stan I'm but I was willing to give up the thing for an overall cleaner system which they've done by focusing on this I mean it's true that some taxpayers um\nBecause they're deductions on this will be kept\nA we'll have to pay more but there's also you know the AMC has been pared back and so forth that others standard induction has been raised so most people are getting a tax cut and even the people who fear that they're not I mean we'll have to see in April but I think more it's going to a more is going to be a wash\nBut it's it's a crazy argument I mean she's essentially arguing the tax bill\nWas it was a tax hike\nAnd in other ways and means he can argue the figures old time but they have figure saying that for the average Morris county or congressional district member eleven in New Jersey the average family of four is going to get a six thousand dollar tax break\n[noise] this is a problem the Democrats look to solve these last month since the tax cutting JOBS Act to explain away the booming economy even to take credit for it I guess and uh build the general conventional wisdom is that they have been successful is that accurate in New Jersey\n[noise] well I think I think someone in New Jersey look on the Republican running Jay Webber is is the real thing he's a principal a Republican and one of the few with the guts to embrace the tax cuts you know he says luck be he would like to roll back some of the salt caps as well\nBut uh overall it's been a big benefit the reason that Democrats get away with it in New Jersey and particularly the eleventh is that a Nike Sheryl is a very ...\nAll it's been a big benefit the reason the Democrats get away with it in New Jersey in particularly the eleventh is that ah Mikey Sheryl is a very attractive candidate and by that I mean also has a um\nAn attractive backstory she's the Naval Academy graduate I Believe a former helicopter pilot in the navy and worked for a federal prosecutor she also doesn't have a voting record\nRight and it's just absurd to complain about the capping of the salt tax\nAs for tax relief when you say nothing about the high New Jersey taxes that Democrats have given us I mean since June to own they've raised taxes and what's already one of the most over tax safe they raise taxes on corporate income on personal income and on gas taxes just since June\nAnd it's going to get worse so um you know it's not a coincidence\nThat I'm Michelle says nothing about the tax hikes that her fellow Democrats love to impose on\nThe poor residents of New Jersey stand like me\nFor those who do not live in the east coast New Jersey as part of the trifecta of blue states with an enormously high tax demand\nAnd that is why the salt fat is the state and local tax non deduction in the tax cutting JOBS Act is such an argument here because one one hand you have all Democrats and then the other hand the will to do Democrats\nNow have can no longer did duck their ... their\nProperty taxes as they could before and that limits the ability of the Democratic governors to raise taxes that's what that's that's a Frank Murphy in New Jersey Andrew Cuomo in New York certainly no bill that that solve the ducks and going away means that they have a harder time just routinely raising taxes\nYeah and ah it's actually it's going to force them to pay a price for it it's just so so we don't have a press that s a lot of questions so again Mike you Charles running on a very attractive resume suburban mom good\nGood background in the military it's harder for her image she runs very good abs I think her image is just hard to associate with ... the style Democrats and she says she wouldn't vote for ... see\nAs speaker but really do you believe that if she's elected that she's going to be a voice for a tax reform and lower taxes in Washington I mean she's going to be voting with the rest of her party\nIs she is the party of Mrs flows he says that our first priority and she's going to be the speaker if the Democrat I get that right I heard\nFirst priority is rolling back the tax bill\nI mean um it's just crazy we we are without doubt New Jersey the dumb as voters I mean we've all these professionals who who um are supposedly so smart and so educated and um and yet we allow ourselves to be so badly run so\nMonstrous Lee over taxed and this is one reason why\nRolling back the tax bill before rolling back Brett Kavanaugh and Donald Trump yet there was a priority\nNow I don't think that Brent Kavanaugh is in her belly where but I think she was like to do is try the\n... race affect the Weber shall race in any fashion cars I see an end as is struggling to make a case here\n[laughter] yeah I'm not sure in the debate I'm Jay Webber you know I asked her whether she would vote for ... and she said she would call them a fighter for New Jersey I'm not sure that helps her but I I think the truth is in New Jersey eleventh\nJust no one wants to ask tough questions like what it really means for the state\nUm would it really means for our economy and uh whether whether we're going to get lower taxes as as a sort of imply if we vote for him Mikey Cheryl I it's it's just preposterous\nThe conventional wisdom says that the Democrats have between twenty and thirty feet to win here at dry and forty to win in order to take the majority and the Charlie Cook report says that ... a good number\nIs is the shell district critical to that thirty or is this was always going to be a democratic way\nI'm not sure it was always going to be a democratic win but it it fits the profile to swing suburban district it's been represented by ... Rodney freezing house and a moderate Republican who has been over three right who retired so it fits the profile that way\nUm there's been a freelancer housing in Congress almost since there's been a Congress [laughter] um so it fits the profile of retiring Republican members also the state's been growing blue or\nYou know I mean even before Donald Trump hum New Jersey's becoming a much bluer so ah I I'm not sure this just happened to be the year I mean Jay Webber to me is a very attractive candidate he understands economics he's been a strong voice in the state assembly\nBut again he has votes to defend than his opponent doesn't she just running on a uh some attractive ads and a good resume\nBuilding ...
