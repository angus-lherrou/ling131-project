... we're living in a weird world we begin with the president of the United states who has decided that he doesn't like Stormy Daniels anymore\nSo here's what happened there was a lawsuit and certainly Daniels and filed against the president of the United states is always a frivolous lawsuit anybody with a law degree knew this and there was a suit in which she sued him for defamation after he\nTweeted that she was engaged in a total con job\nAnd she eats he pointed a sketch years later about a non existent man a total ... job playing the fake news media proposal does when she claimed

thrown out the case was thrown out\nAnd here's what the guys wrote the court agrees ... argument because the ... in question constitutes rhetorical hyperbole normally associated with politics and public discourse in the United states the first amendment protects this type of rhetorical statement not only that the judge ruled that Stormy Daniels now have to take from legal things\nOut so the

face sweetest Washington Mall W. M. A. L.\nWashington comes to talk will come back to the\nBench of hero show it turns out that Elizabeth Warren the senator from Massachusetts Native American but she kept claiming she was for years well why didn't she just kept claiming it and then apologized for having done so like five years ago there are a couple of good reasons\nHere's a thing there's a story that came out September first of this year in the Boston Globe and it just got a serious issue for Elizabeth Warren\nWas Senator Warren actually\nA professor at Harvard law because she couldn't Native American ancestry in other words wishing granted special status that sort of gave her an an upper hand when it came to her job at University of Pennsylvania or at Harvard law school was more articles in the Boston Globe into research found that\nFolks at Harvard said that her Native American claims had nothing to do with any of that that her Native American claims had nothing to do with our actual ability\nTo be granted a professorship at Harvard law school they interviewed to like thirty one professors who are on the admissions many someone from I Know people like Charles Fried who I have for contract they didn't know when we hired her it had nothing to do with her Clinton Native American ancestry in fact we didn't even know that it's time we assume she was white\nAnd the internal documents suggested that University of Pennsylvania treated her as a white person and started Harvard law school until it became beneficial for them to claim that she was a minority heritage\nFor purposes of their diversity curriculum that they had to claim that they had a certain number of diverse professors and so they sort of take it and said that she was Native American but that doesn't mean she got her job\nBased on Native American Native American claims\n... so with that said why didn't Elizabeth Warren\nA month and a half ago simply say look I was told by my family members that I had turkey has after my mom used to tell me that my uncles and aunts used to tell me that and because of that I simply assume that they're right I was going to assume that my relatives were lying to me those are the stories that I was growing up I guess that was wrong\nAnd so I never should have done any of that stuff but it didn't have any impact on my actual career trajectory by career trajectory was going to be great no matter what and had nothing to do with those claims so I Apologize Native Americans are having taken seriously the stories of my family without checking them but with that said\nTo claim that I was beneficiary of some sort of affirmative action is simply untrue\nBut why don't you do that well there are two reasons you didn't do that and both of them are telling reasons number one\nShe's bigger that she couldn't get away with pretty much anything because the media would cover for her which the media then yesterday there were headlines in the Daily Beast saying Elizabeth Warren proves Native American ancestry there was a headline over at CNN Elizabeth Warren provide solid evidence of Native American ancestry\nSo she legitimately threw out a study that showed she was not Native American and counted on the media to say that the study showed was actually Native American and then it all began to fall apart because people can read and that meant that her narrative began to collapse in on her\nSo she thought she could get away with it because the media would cover for her and why not why wouldn't you think that I mean to me I have covered for the fact that they don't work in Texas was being treated as an Obama ask Kennedy esque new young figure\nThat that guy was involved in ... who's twenty six and bought him crossing over a median line smashing a truck and then trying to flee from the scene and they're still counting ended the big new neck democratic thing now listen I'm somebody who's had my license suspended for driving too fast\nI'm obvious about that I was not driving drunk and I didn't crash into anybody it was on an empty freeway they don't ... I was driving drunk and hit a die and then tried to flee the scene while he was drunk and the media have basically said that\nIt was on an empty freeway Beto O'Rourke was driving drunk and hit a die and then tried to flee the scene while he was drunk and the media have basically said that the big nothing and the the media that that George W. Bush and the why back in the Nineteen seventies disqualified him in two thousand for money for the presidency like you'll weeks before the election\nSo Elizabeth Warren had good cause the thing that the media we're going to cover for her no matter what the media cover Democrats the way they cover Republican half of the candidates for Congress and the ... election cycle would be post they would be finished bombing end at the New Jersey would be done in the ... honestly he'd be gone\nAre having trouble to they don't all Rourke\nActing on the best ideals of his Democratic spread the wealth around campaign he announced on Monday he's not going to share any of his thirty eight million dollar war chest even though democratic bosses want the cash for more competitive states debate or rocket will lose the Ted Cruz in Texas in the Senate race the latest polls have him down almost double digit\nAfter the media have been falling over him to stay where they found over Wendy Davis the former state senator in Texas who then lost by something like twenty points Greg Abbott\nWell now they're for governor in Texas they're doing the same thing with ... the Texas Democrat told reporters after a campaign rally will not there any spent in his own re he plans to leave all the money he has raised out on the field the head of election day\nO'Rourke raised from July to September thirty eight point one million dollars\nHe says that he's going to he's not going to contribute any of that money to other candidates which is kind of amazing because honestly if he wants to ensure his future and the Democratic party you really should become a patron of ERs right he should be taking that money and distributing it more hotly contested races he's not going to do any of that so that's a bad story for Democrats meaning meanwhile\nClaire McCaskill is running a very tight race in Missouri and James O'Keefe me kind of undercover journalist\nThey is there shock journalist over a project ... he's on some good work before he sent his workers in he's in some of his folks into Claire McCaskill's office and he got Claire McCaskill people to acknowledge that she is campaigning parts of the right where she actually is on the issues here some of what that sounded like yeah I can do them\nBecause she does go to Karen [noise]\nI think some of them is like\nLike overly [laughter]\n[laughter]\nOkay so she's basically been fitting about her own positions so Claire McCaskill is in trouble in Missouri course instead of just three weeks ago was leading mark MacPhail in the Arizona Senate race and now it turns out that all of her past has come out and Kirsten ... case so Kirsten Sinema is the Democratic nominee in Arizona according to the Washington Examiner\nShe apparently takes sorcery very seriously emails obtained by the Washington Examiner show cinema was invited say prominent carbon a feminist which is in Arizona it was called pagan cluster to celebrate International Women's day\nAnd to protest the war in March of two thousand three coping protestors weren't paying obviously nothing the women and black were black but cinema encouraged the which has to wear colorful clothing and come ready to began\nCoral and stay in touch with your inner creativity and with the earth\nAnd send them a campaign would not say why she invited the witches or clarify why she thought members of the occult deserved a seat at the table during discussions concerning more peace which is in question is should be noted claimed to practice only non violent magic part of the about touching on their Web page there is a peaceful and democratic kind of sorcery\nThe painting cluster focuses on sharing spiritual inside and participating in direct democracy divisions are decided liberal many of their coven quote have roots in the reclaiming tradition of feminist witchcraft\nMhm cinema also went to an anti war rally with pay and later that year and a apparently she talked about singing and spiraling into pagan circle only five rose from the police line\nI and then the police arrested everybody so cursing cinema\nAnd just doing humans work on ... campaign also it turns out she organized for the Arizona alliance for peace and justice in one email she urged supporters MBA PJ to dilute to deluge\nThe phone line of a radio show hosted by an unapologetic unconditional supporter of Israeli policy so Kirsten Sinema is basically toast in that Senate race as well Democrats radicalism\nIs the major issue here and all they have is President Trump which is why it's not good that the president of the United states those around calling women ...

new job numbers are just terrific not only that\nWe have the highest federal collection of income taxes\nIn history and twenty Eighteen so if he if he just look at the numbers\nWe're collecting more income taxes than ever before even though we have lower income tax rate than we did last year why because supply side economics works when the economy grows and the government actually takes in more taxes and if the economy a stagnant and we have higher tax rate the economy has been going great guns under President Trump and getting the deficit and the second which is not quite as good but\nDidn't they very good news cycle for President Trump in the last three weeks ago the Supreme Court justice and watch left killed themselves over Capitol Hill is with Lauren and one of the great on force political blunders in my lifetime releasing a report saying she was Native American when she is less\nIs less Indian than actual people from India\nLike actual people from India have more Native American blood middle is the ... it's an amazing thing\nAnd with that said President Trump decides to step on himself with Stormy Daniels and calling people horse face this is the only line of attack that Democrats have it's just a tax on President Trump and so this is what they're ratcheting up Nancy Pelosi was looking at a bad Senate map right now\nShe's trying to suggest that President Trump is now in the pay of the Saudis that the reason that President Trump hasn't been harsher on the Saudi Government with regards number I'm Jamal shock either alleged ... an American resident who was a critic of the Saudi regime and also a fan of Muslim Brotherhood\nShe says the reason from hasn't been harsher because maybe he's being paid off by the Saudis\nIn terms of Saudi Arabia I think that was I always wondered why he went there is the first country to visit as to the United states of course as president of the United states oh the other presidents that to Ronald Reagan went to [noise]\nTo Canada or one to Mexico for George W Bush so and our hemisphere was that many friends and allies who could have gone into because it was I was always suspicious that there was some kind of the financial transaction involved there whether for his businesses or what ever\nGood luck with his line of attack it it's pretty crazy that the that Democrats think the only way that they're going to be able to win election just by simply throwing out on verified and under five all information like that but it shows how desperate they are which is why again an forced errors are the biggest problem for the Trump Administration they've always been\nThe biggest problem for the from the ministry here's here's I think the rule in American politics right now whoever's shut the first one\nReally because this is just it's the worst tennis match ever\nBut if you if you watch tennis players ... very often you'll see that that sometimes the best strategy is just get the ball over the net because sooner or later somebody isn't a smack the ball into the net and then he went\nBasically ... there's a great wind which which comedian is it I think is Mitch Hedberg is that ... that the name of the comedians on and so he has a line he says no matter how good the problem I have a tendency to no matter how good I get I'm never better than the wall\nWell that's that's essentially what's happening American politics right now if you are the wall you win if you are the wall you wouldn't at all if you are the person who just sit there and let the other side banging his head against you you when\nYou're the person who commits a un force errors you lose the Democrats have been committing a un force there after an forced air here\nAnd that's why it would be great if the president would just stop but and again I guess we're going to have an entire news cycle now about horse race doesn't hurt Trump in any serious way not really but it does jazz up the Democrats again their minds and how much they hate President Trump when he goes away it's hard for them to talk about this as much really cares\nBut with that said that Trump Trump Trump that's just the way that it goes now\nTrump also comes along with the benefit of ... ... there's always a good side to what Trump is in a bad guy to what Trump is so the same guy who calls his former lovers horse race is the same fellow who's actually trying to stop these immigrant caravan that have been traveling from places like Honduras\nSo President Trump on Tuesday threatened to withdraw funding an aid from Honduras if it does not solitaire amount of people that had is heading to the United\nA link from places like Honduras so President Trump on Tuesday threatened with running an aid from Honduras if it does not stop the caravan of people that had is heading to the United states\nFrom the United states has strongly informed the president of Honduras that at the large caravan of people heading to the U.

blind shake have long been convicted his appeals had run all of his ability to appeal to the court or for any relief or had passed and Lynn was not performing the shake was not an accused\n... under American law and Lynn was not performing the work of a criminal defense lawyer she was a performing the work of somebody who transmits\nMessages for a a jihadist shaped into his subordinates Saturdays\nOh what an\nRepresentative set of our hope to get out of this arrangement [noise]\nI think she'd like to stick our head in the sand and and protect me when that happens actually um I think this is a quote this is a situation a fatty is where um she was trying to put herself on the map politically\nAnd in her community and the ah the way to do that at the time was to appeal to her fellow radicals and then when she thought that it was a expedient in Arizona or to to change spots\nAs it were in order to rise politically uh she met a more photos as a um I I I guess you would call a moderate progressive\nThat's the uh sheep's clothing she's been in ever since the problem for her I think is that she's now trying to go for statewide office rather than just her uh her\nHer place that she had in the ninth or district in Arizona and so braces much more competitive there are many more eyes on it there's a lot more money involved in it and her her past is catching up\nWith her let's be very specific Andy for people who are not less with us in the late twentieth century the blind shake ... was convicted for participating in the attack the first attack on the world Trade Center\nAnd though that attack did not lead to a mass casualties that could have as I recall that explosion was capable of causing mass casualties it did not bring down the building because maybe we just got lucky the first time\nThat's exactly right John it was a fourteen hundred pound chemical explosive\nThat the jihadists are not only composed with an idea of I'm knocking one of the towers of the of the world Trade Center as it appeared at the time into the other tower or they also attempted to air raid\nCyanide in the course of the explosion they had hydrogen tank Senate and a cyanide a which the\nBomb and the idea was that when it exploded the hope was that the tanks would explode and they would be able to kill people not only at the epicenter of the explosion but also very remote they were hoping to kill tens of thousands of people and the fact that they only killed six remains one of the\nUh really major miracles of modern time\nAnd it's not it's not rational to conclude that send them a did not know this connection between the blind shake and the attempted mass murder of Americans and her hosting stores that would've been entirely available for send them at the time\nI think the only reason that land was notable John was because of bad\nRepresentation and and the reason that she was particularly famous or infamous depending on your perspective of it at the time was because she was under indictment this was very publicly known\nOr she was under indictment for helping the blind shake basically run his Egyptian terrorists organizations so if you would go through the the\nUh the labor is of hosting her\nOr it would be because she had this notoriety\nOr minutes at ... go ahead\n[laughter] sounds very are carrying the radical she re soccer out six where the lawyer who does something wrong or is there something wrong then becomes across collect glass as soon as an allergist on the situation doesn't it\nNot only does that he is I think that Lynn had her roots in ... in precisely that group of radical lawyers have been acting sixties she worked closely with ah with Bill consular who of course was one of the\nLawyers on the Chicago Seven\nA lawyer sued the sixties she worked closely with ah with Bill counselor who of course was one of the lawyers on the Chicago Seven um so yeah I Do it all goes back to the same thing\nAndrew McCarthy riding the national Review Online this is about a Senate contest that is right now we're looking at the midterms\nAre Kirsten Sinema is the Democratic Senate hopeful and a mix to a mix Sally a market and Sally is that correct that is Martha Martha ... is the Republican candidate but Andrew McCarthy has done is the favor of connecting some of the dots that perhaps\n... will explain before or after the election\nThat is McCotter W. J. are the great voice of the great lakes I'm John ...\nFive point nine ... am six thirty Washington Mall W A L\nThey ... the surgery a cricket of who's the head of the man's face plug in Russia is also a former congressman who also is the first to flying the shuttle and was the first to one of the first came to occupy says he had a press conference last week in which he said they tend to down to what happened is\nThe first stage of the stories rocket is actually for strap on boosters in the course stages that step as strap on to attach to the second stage\nThey fire launch put at a certain point those four strap on separate off\nAnd then of course they takes over his hip stage\nAnd what happened is one of those four strapped ... did not separate properly and that was what caused the collision\nA new member you might remember I talked about how a valve did not release and this was proud vowels it was supposed to release oxygen to I think like a rush to to push that strap on away so it didn't separate that's where the problem came from a have not said when what's going to happen in terms of launches there is a man to assemble launch\nUm uh uh uh uh the crew on boats supposed to return in December because it's being replaced by another crew in December\nThe Russians are saying they have not yet rescheduled that mission they are hopeful that we'll have\nA solve this issue and moved on by December and that might be the case they're supposed to be a progress launch a in between and they ... and that's using a Soyuz rocket they might use that launched to test to see if they thought solve the problem\nHere once again now beginning to look at the sub company in Russia which is really just the division of earth cosmos to that builds a strap bombs to see if the source of the problem came from there will have to wait and see\nRight now we're in a holding pattern we don't know how the the manned program will be affected the American we're trying to build the commercial replacements to the Russians and it's unfortunate that American government doesn't seem that much urgency to move up or push that forward\nThat just saying wow we're going to call the longest safety panel at NASA yesterday was saying well we're not so sure you can get it done on time you got issues there is not right the paperwork hasn't been done right we think you should delay those larger so that's where we stand right now\nJohn Dr Spitzer and all three of the champions of biggest drawn them a buck Chandra X ray observatory in a safe mode what's that mean\nWell it's actually back in operation that went into safe mode a middle of last week they announced it over the weekend how convenient trying to hide it um\nAnd it was because one of their gyros went into ... cost a problem that forced them to go into\nSafe mode while they were very quickly able to figure out what that issue was when they switch to a backup ... operation conjure is one of the\nFour great observatories that NASA has launched his Nineteen nineties um uh the Compton gamma ray observatory was the first to launch if it was the all but it back in two thousand and one of the other three were as you mentioned Hubble Chandra and Spencer\nSpencer is in what the Cold War mowed it doesn't ... it's a it's an infrared observatory which means it needs refrigeration to really see him for it and they ran out of refrigeration several years ago so it's no longer doing the observations as it was originally designed although isn't safe mode because it's charter school problem in might never come back\nAnd now ... ... is really beginning to run out of its drivers scopes and I point out that the the the problems are really the fault of the astronomy community entirely they take the blame that goes back in the early to thousands a made a decision\nI'm as a group that uh astronomy a community that they were going to put all their eggs in the basket of the James Webb telescope leaving nothing for replacements for these uh war costs telescopes\nHorrible you know we know what's happened with the Web it's been it's now a decade behind schedule and it's cost has gone up eight to nine times from a billion to nine billion and so nothing else has gotten built and we don't have replacements for ... or ... or anything\nAnd the trauma can when he's continued to put money into big expense who giant projects like Web because they started to push\nSo or anything and the the ... when he's continued to put its money into big expense who giant projects like Web because they started to push\nIn two thousand and eleven the building of W first another giant in for a telescope that's going to take a decade to build a cost billions assuming there are no cost overruns well I won't make that assumption\nSo this is probably the blame of just trying to kill me it's also partly the blame of the ... of the big government space in General John which we talked about with the Russians\nAnd we talked about here with the this astronomy big projects that are mostly pork don't produce anything like Web\nAnd you know so I had an op ed\nAt the federal is fabulous right now and which Bob identifies\nThe big space predilection the Congress and now the Trump Administration because it's buying into it Bob despite the disruption and swamp draining a metaphors we see a continuation of the big space companies\nYeah you know where it with calling draining the swamp pays off an obvious ways Trump has been doing it like at the EPA but something like space in his NASA\nWell he wants to have a big space program and so he's all well the willing to go along with the law being of the big space companies like Lockheed Martin and Boeing and Northrop Grumman\nUm they've been doing heavy lobbying on both congressman trucking industry compared to buy into it to build the gateway the lunar a love temporarily occupied\nProbably for ... not to be built for maybe a decade and a decade plus a boondoggle around the mold and this would give us a less its its project its mission that doesn't have one right now I don't know what these really ours just blue dog because they don't really know Congress doesn't care\nUm the bureaucracy at NASA doesn't care these big space companies none of them in care whether anything ever gets built they're not interested in the national interest not in the slightest what they're interested in their own personal interest\nOf bureaucracies want to maintain their jobs that department's their agencies Congress wants to claim that uh pork chops the district so they built anything or not and ... and ... and those kind of companies\nSuggested they've done with ... and they just want to have that the government money coming in and year to year whether they build anything or not they don't care if and I have a launches an gateway will be that way it's gonna be a decade plus before it gets anything done\nIt you know in that decade plus down the road we might see three launches adventure less and ain't going to build anything but that's what's going on now and that's what I write about wrote about on the federalist it's a boondoggle disaster they really want to clean things up there's other ways to do with space sex has given us a hint\nGovernment should no longer be building anything it should be buying the products from private enterprise and that's the bottom\nAnd Bob there is no prospect of the Congress changing directions whether the Democrats are the Republicans are the majorities in Congress both both parties have found a way to profit from big space\nOr my whole point of my op ed is to point out how the corruption and in Congress and the ... and the bureaucracies and the Trump Administration and from because he's not paying attention to this\nIs is is is continuing they pour money into things that will just not produce anything but it pays off their friends you\nKnow so your big companies be of a campaign contributions fund the think tanks in DC everyone looks around and says oh isn't it wonderful what we're doing there's a lot of the press that reads about gateway and we're not doing any research says oh that's wonderful\nThey talk about less like it's wonderful but nothing type of accomplished it doesn't go anywhere it's it's a waste of money gets launched it's been now\nWe don't we will we have a gateway twenty thirty\nYeah I doubt it are wanting for and how to twenty four now\nMaybe you'll get launched in the late twenty twenties but come on look at how the U.S less has gotten delayed the odds are willing to bet that this will\nGet you don't have to involve I just wanted to give some numbers out there and people can calculate how old do being twenty thirty how 'bout twenty forty gateway\n[noise] so I I honestly don't believe that's going to get launched for decades it's just it's just the way this works look as the left has\nBeen I Know I I was talking to you in two thousand and two what George Bush in the White House and I said as the last twenty twenty you would have said well maybe nope it's not going to happen not crap\nAnd it's not going to happen and uh you know a ... SOS might get his first launch off maybe by twenty twenty four that would be Twenty years after Bush proposed right and that will be Twenty years to build a single\nGuy and I lost about ... in thousand no one would believe just Bob if we said twenty twenty well I'm saying it now about gateway and I are now empirical facts on the twenty\nThirty eight to twenty forty four somewhere in there okay\nFor you know if we're lucky if you're a ... year model I guarantee\nThe Chinese will be settling colonies on the moon and laughing at us\nGermany keeps the ... behind the black\nWe're lucky if they lobbied while I guarantee the Chinese will be settling colonies on the moon and laughing at us\nBob's gym and it keeps the ... behind the black we're going to turn to exploring when we come back I'm John batch so this is the John ...

France\nKagan Great Britain was it you know with someone who wrote about about tactics who wrote about warfare and that's how he made his name he was considered a bright young thing a he'd been a staff officer during the occupation of Bosnia and Eighteen Seventy eight then he climbed ... through the general staff\nGeneral staff have been run for decades by an old boon companions the emperor's named a free drink back who was a long serving general staff chief till he was finally ousted by the Archduke and replaced with Conrad in Nineteen oh five [noise]\nBut ah ... in in in Beck's general staff Conrad was a really hard working guy who you know took on a lot of the hard jobs in proved himself in staff work but he he really knew nothing about men you know nothing about leading man he knew nothing about organizing men\nAnd he didn't know anything about the hard realities that war imposes on leadership\nHe had one and he had one right well let's let's compare him to a rival if we can find someone in the twenty first century pope TRL his\nRival at the time was ... was another guy who will be his principles figure in this story and his name as general all scar puts your work and put your was another one of these general staff officers around the same age as Conrad who'd grown up in this back\nGeneral staff doing the hard work of the ... the senior leadership and to be on building solid portfolios but again someone who had never had any real combat experience someone whose experience of war was entirely theoretical someone who's qualifications were entirely bureaucratic\nAnd it's just sort of the thing about Conrad and put your their qualifications are bureaucratic these guys build little empires inside the so called grey house the old war ministry building which has the general staff as well and they built these very powerful clinics that had powerful mentors in the case of Conrad the Archduke Franz Ferdinand in the case of posts York

an action neither man had any idea what the war would actually be like and when the war actually broke out and they were exposed to the hard realities and the friction of it all they proved orderly

be interested in sex in marriage\nAnd instead of just finding a nice you know Vietnamese flour to settle down with he settled on the wife of a very wealthy businessman and carry on a semi public

I had big contracts with the government he thought hey this might be good for business if my wife has an affair with general Conrad so he tolerated but\nYou know someone like the Archduke who's you know a very pious very Roman Catholic hated\nThe idea that his hand picked general staff tree was carrying on an extramarital affair but anyway so uh but the you know Conrad just proved as he was a
