findings it's not clear what exactly will be made public at any point suffice it to say it's not expected to anything groundbreaking will happen here\nAnd there is a reason to Mitch McConnell is going off on the Democrats over all of this and Senate majority leader he comes for he says wasn't all of this was a stall tactic all this was a delay tactic\nDemocrats who had no intention of voting for Brett Kavanaugh and the first place are suddenly acting all outraged at the FBI investigation is wrapping too soon when they knew and wrap that soon because the FBI investigation\nActually has less investigative power and the Senate Judiciary committee they can subpoena documents they can subpoena witnesses it's not a criminal investigation that means they can go and ask people to talk to them and they talk to people they can talk and the Democrats are whining anyway here's Mitch McConnell saying listen we're not going to hold the soccer up any longer we're done here\nShould just remind us

from Christine Blasey Ford's former boyfriend that knocked a bunch of holes indoor story we'll talk about what exactly those holes are one\nShe never mentioned for years and the thing about the sexual assault never mentioned cabinet now that doesn't necessarily under cut all of her credibility according to pour she never said anything until two thousand twelve author she testified in front of the Senate she never coach anybody with Rodolfo polygraph members you made a big deal out of taking the polygraph and she's still a turtle her notes\nFrom her psychiatrist you turn over her polygraph now butter polygraph knows Rachel questions of their own such as\nIn the polygraph notes the original polygraph note said before she took the polygraph that she was sexually assaulted in the early eighties you crossed out early nobody knows why\nNobody knows why then she took the polygraph and then she passed the polygraph but she testified\nUnder oath that she did not coach anyone on a polygraph never asked white friend says that's not true there is her testifying about this ...\nI didn't expect it to be as long as it was going to be so it's a little bit stressful and you have you ever given chips or advice to somebody who was looking to take a polygraph test never [laughter]\nHey and it turned out that that is a serious question for\nWere you lying about that Senator Chuck Grassley has now sent a letter to the attorneys for this woman for Christine Blasey Ford and he asked for material evidence relevant the allegation is does he want some corroborating evidence he says he wants to notice when therapy sessions the doctor for discuss\nAnd then she turned over to the Washington Post\nAnd he says that he wants copies of all video or audio recordings produce during the course of the polygraph examination of Dr Ford would she will not turn over\nAnd then he says the full details and Dr force polygraph are particularly important because the Senate Judiciary committee\nHas received a sworn statement from a long time ... ... that he personally witnessed soccer for coaching a friend on polygraph examination when asked under oath and the hearing whether she'd ever given any tips or advice to someone who is planning on taking a polygraph backer for replied never\nMisstatement raising specific concerns about the reliability of her polygraph examination result instead of therefore needs this information\nSo she's got a credibility problem there as well then she also has another credibility problem it turns out that she said in her Senate testimony over and over again\nThat she was in therapy in two thousand twelve because she had a fight with her husband about building a second front door and the reason that she wanted a second front door is because she had security concern because she was still deeply disturbed about her alleged sexual assault\nAt the hands of Brett Kavanaugh will now it turns out that that's a really dicey story real clear investigations pulse Barry over real their investigations has a piece\nIn which he does real estate and other records under cut a key part of Christine Blasey Ford's accounts of why she finally came forward with charges of attempted rape against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh after some Thirty years\nFour testified last week should never revealed the details of the alleged attack until twenty twelve when she was the couples therapy with her husband she said the memories percolated off as they revisited a disagreement they'd had over her insistence on and selling a second front door when they remodeled their Palo Alto California home\nThey need to explain a decision her husband didn't understand pushed her to say she wanted the door to alleviate symptoms and foster phobia and panic attacks based on the alleged assault\nShe was physically asked about this by Dianne Feinstein Feinstein asked is that the reason for the second front doors claustrophobia and Ford said correct\nBut documents reveal the door was installed years before as part of an addition it has been used by renters and even a marriage counseling business the door was not an escape route but an entrance roots and attorney familiar with the ongoing congressional investigation it appears the real plan for the second front door was to rent out a separate room\n... Palo Alto CD records show a building permit from the additional ruin exterior is or was issued a born and her husband on February for two thousand eight more than four years before the may twenty talk therapy session or she first identified cabin up as her attacker\nAlthough the modeling was completed by February twenty ten they only additional permission to Fort at her Palo Alto address or solar panels on the roof a solar hot water system in the garage and electric vehicle charging station for the driveway\nOkay so there we have it and because she said it therefore it must be true see and believe that's how that's all we've got it turns out that other allegations with regard to be the nominee are also falling apart there was an NBC story about Brett Kavanaugh this one has to do with Deborah Ramirez and accused have enough perjury\nAnd then it turns out that he was in fact guilty of perjury\nSo here's what NBC originally reported they said the text between ... and ... euro Savage both friends with Kavanaugh suggest a nominee was personally talking with former classmates that Deborah Ramirez a story in advance of the New Yorker article that made her allegation public remember Deborah Ramirez lady who allege\nThat at some frat party at Yale Brett Kavanaugh exposed himself in front of her in one message eras average that have not asked her to go on record in his defense\nTo other messages show communication between having a scheme and former classmates in advance and the story that text also demonstrate the cabinet and remembers one more socially connected than previously understood\nAnd Ramirez was uncomfortable around cabinet and they saw each other at a wedding ten years after they graduated or comes efforts also show that some potential witnesses have been unable to get important information to the FBI on Monday a senior U.S official confirmed the White House has authorized the FBI to expand its initially limited investigation and that was the original report\nThen they went back from self edited and here's the data and now public transcripts from an interview with the Republican Judiciary Committee staff on September twenty fifth two days after the ... the nearest allegations were reported in the New Yorker cabinet claimed it was Ramirez was calling around uh classmates trying to see if they remembered it\nAdding it strikes me as you know what is going on here\nWhen someone is calling around to try and refreshing other people is that what's going on what's going on with that that doesn't sound good it doesn't sound good to me it doesn't sound fair it doesn't sound proper it sounds like an orchestrated hits pick me up in other words NBC first claimed the Kavanaugh is calling around to try and ... story and now it turns out that he had already testified\nHe'd already testified that it was Ramirez who is calling around to try and bolster her story\nSo good job media well done all the way through there is another allegation that seems to be having some trouble then there's the allegation from Julie sweating it because of course coming from Michael ... it turns out that a former boyfriend of Julie sweating it has now\nJulie sweating it has now issued a letter\nTo the to the Senate Judiciary committee and here's what it says my name is Kendra I'm a former weeknight media meteorologist for channel seven in Washington DC and one in any in Nineteen Ninety five\nI Want to preface this by saying I'm proud nor guilt was in the actions about you mentioned in this letter I Hope my friends family and church members can forgive me I first met Julie sweating it in Nineteen Ninety three and Washington DC bar and you're Wisconsin circle\nHow's it going away party for channel seven anchor Dale Sally I left the party to go to the bar to buy a soda I haven't drunk alcohol since my ... birthday as I sat alone at the end of the bar Julie approach me she was alone quite beautiful well dressed and no drinking Han consequently my initial thought was that you might be a high end call girl because of the time I weigh three hundred and fifty pounds so it was someone like her want with me\nBut there was no conversation about a changing sex for money so I decided to talk with her a few minutes\nI'd never been hit on in a bar before I didn't leave with her that night although we talked about getting together over the next couple of weeks we met when I Believe in civil he was Jewish place from the beginning Julie knew I was married and then I was having marital issues\n... says she was an opportunist I felt she had only interest in my three hundred fifty pounds sell because I was on TV and well known although we're not emotionally involved there was physical contact we never had sex despite the fact is very sexually aggressive with me\nAll of her fantasies you know sets of multiple guy and he suggests that or she is politically motivated and he says\nThat basically she's not going to be believed he basically calls her sociopath a and so that's that's not great or her account either and I can always was was really troublesome right that the gang rape account was always\nVery difficult to substantiate considering there should have been witnesses for any of that stuff\nWe're going to get to a final allegation the Democrats tried to bring up last minute and just one second but first let's talk about your sleep quality there's nobody on the planet like you said why would you buy generic mattress built for anyone else he'll sleep has built we've quiz that takes two minutes to complete\nThey use the answers to match your body type and sleep preferences the perfect mattress whether aside sleeper a hot leap or whether you like a pleasure from but the ... there's no more guessing no more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash Shapiro take their two minutes leave cause they'll natural mattress it will give you the best leap of your life you\nKnow to me today you hear how energetic I Am as I got some good sleep over the Jewish holidays and that's because I use helix sleep my wife and I took this liquid as we got the healer sleep mattress we've popped it on the bed came in the mail in rapid in place right in front of you\nGo check it out here like sleep dot com it's last Shapiro for couples you can even split that mattress down the middle providing individual support needs and your preferences for each side they have a ten year warranty you have to try it out for a hundred nights where it's free so what do you have to lose\nRight now he looks is offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders get up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off and he looked sleep dot com slash Shapiro as he would sleep dot com slash a bureau for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or he'll sleep dot com slash Shapiro\nCase a final allegation those brought by Democrats again and all the allegations are falling apart the final allegation those brought against Brett Kavanaugh was brought last minute by Senator Chris Coons so here is the accusation apparently Chris Coons forwarded an allegation related to judge Kavanaugh's years in New haven\nThe accuser who apparently created TV show in which people strip well dancing to their favorite music\nWhich is an awesome TV show probably tells a party that took place at the house and judge Kavanaugh was undergrad fraternity during the Nineteen eighty seven to Nineteen eighty eight\nSchoolyard which allegedly featured some salacious activity of course judge Kavanaugh had already graduated when this party allegedly took place on the first year law student that period as as you well know most academically intense time and most students' lives is allegations has all the makings of a tabloid headlines\nBut there's just one problem excuse are freely admit to having no evidence whatsoever that judge Kavanaugh even attended his party is Chuck Grassley slapping the crap out of Chris Coons\nRather than provide even circumstantial evidence of judge Kavanaugh's attendance excuse or provide some investigative evidence he proposes that someone searched judge Kavanaugh was calendars the very same calendar is your colleagues have dismissed and derided\nTo determine whether he attended a frat party at some point in Nineteen eighty seven and I ... and that's it\nOh he alleges that he wants witnesses salacious party at a house owned by judge Kavanaugh was an undergrad fraternity and then separately advises us to obtain and search judge Kavanaugh's calendars to determine if he attended we have reached a new level of absurdity with this allegation there was no evidence the judge Kavanaugh's anywhere near the party or anything to do with it at all\nIn fact the only person we can be sure attended the party was the accuser\nInvestigators have serious work to do all the minority has refused to engage with the allegations against judge Kavanaugh in any meaningful way by investigators have tried to pursue every relevant lead and therefore hope that before boarding an allegation and the future will first consider whether you'd want you and your staff has been valuable time investigating it thanks for your consideration [laughter]\nHonestly I I got to love Chuck Grassley at this point do just does not give any after this way he's he's like you know what we're done we're just done here we are finished it ... it it it's just great because he doesn't seem Bernie Sanders earlier this week Bernie Sanders sent him a letter saying we want a longer FBI investigation and Grassley sent him a letter back\nSaying Bernie you came out five minutes after the nomination and said that you were going to oppose cabinet do\nYou think all I can change your mind you're going to have your mind maybe we'll talk about it is just\nIt's amazing so all of this leads up to the fact that there's just a shifting argument going on and let this started off if you recall\nThis started off if you recall with an argument that Brett Kavanaugh is unfit for the court because he allegedly tried to write the goal is Seventeen but that was the original allegations then it turned into gay rights that turned out to be all but it turned into expose himself at a party no evidence of that and it turned into okay well maybe it's 'cause angry\nRights any anger it we had them angry people on the court because Ruth Bader Ginsburg seems like a delight\nBitter Ginsberg who goes out and ran as RPG the Tories are being Jim yeah but she goes out and she ran politically every five minutes\nShe's perfectly she's perfectly well ... yeah the corporate bread cabinet that mad when you accused him of being a gang rape is doesn't belong on the court the shifting ballpark posts are just insane here's Hillary Clinton thing Brett Kavanaugh behavior is out of bounds\nOr I mean Hillary you want to be president and you drank John McCain under a table and throw a lamp that your husband serves that\nHey here's Hillary Clinton wearing again something that she got from Mugabe's wardrobe and ...\nBut I think for anyone who believe there's such a thing as a judicial temperament and that\nJudges particularly those on our highest court to approach issues approach plaintiffs in defendants with um a sense of fairness that there's a lot to be concerned about because\nHe got mad when you use them of of being ... and I remember someone else getting mad when when her husband was accused of rape I remember that\nWho is that have been accused of sexual assault that was probably true I remember somebody getting mad about that oh yeah and she wanted to be president of the United states by the way I should correct modulator references moved ... not ... he was a dictator and Bob way back to his got through the character from doing okay how how often the shift that the the Sanders Alison camera on CNN [noise]\nThere's a story about how bright cabinet back when he was in college gotten a bar fight with a guy through some ice at a guy\nNow let me explain how this works I went to Harvard law school a lot of great minds they're one of these folks will be senators the people who are in my class and there was a group of guys who go out they invited me but I did as you'll hear this is not my type of party they would go out to bars they'll get drunk off their butts and then they would just suck each other in the nuts\nI not not a joke like they would actually just punch each other and the growing like this is an actual thing that I Would hear about later as you can imagine not my kind of party came by\nThe accusation here by ... the ice throwers are more likely to assault so if you're in a bar fight with due to a bar and he threw ice Adam then it must be they use sexually assaulted a woman years prior\nMakes perfect sense makes perfect sense\nI'm with you all the way Allison that guys here's Alison camera out and making a fool of herself\nI think if you are known as a belligerent main fighting drunk that's relevant I think that it's relevant to ban a woman who says you would corner her and putting your hand over her mouth somehow that I think makes more sense than if you were just a fun drunk who always felt right to flee\nWhen Democrats had a fourteen point lead now down to seven in the Quinnipiac poll it is possible that Republicans retain the house because Democrats or ... or so to stuffing which would just be poetic justice will not be phenomenal if the Republicans retain the house because of Brett Kavanaugh\nThat would just first of all the insanity that is likely to break out on the back of that will just be on the looming evil things will just be no so ... as I said my children there'll be crazy\nWell we'll be back here tomorrow with all the latest I'm sure there'll be plenty of breaking news I think maybe we'll talk about that measure of\n\nWhether you'll if it were rich W a Mayo Washington shot one thousand dollar\nYou'll you hear me now to\nTragic loss I'm Barbara ...\nThe largest coalition of Christian churches in the U.S has called for the withdrawal of Brett Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court\nThe national council of churches representing more than forty million churchgoers posted a statement on his website thing judge Kevin on demonstrated during are

I was dreaming a there's it's a very unlikely that the European with the United states and Mexico will be on the home page on this\nEuropeans are desperate for growth and um they don't want to offend China and uh because they have a lot of businesses that operate ... quite a bit of money in China\nSo I expect very little uh agreement between those three parties on this and the Chinese are are\nI think are banking on that because they know that the Europeans are kind of split with the Americans right now both politically and economically\nAndrew I'm what is the state of the Chinese economy today I mean especially after the September numbers is it a better than people say or where do you see it going [noise] well\nThen can number so far I haven't met that exports were up fairly\nHelpfully and imports were up uh the August numbers which are twenty percent which is pretty good showing 'em so there's a bit of weakness in the export powerhouse area of quote don't province in the south with which accounts for twenty percent of exports and they're starting to see a bit of a recession so we may be seeing the beginning\nBut so far the economy's been at the helm holding up surprisingly well\nAnd is that because of trade friction or is there some other factor\nI'm pretty sure that we can go out and going is because of trade friction the data it's inconclusive at this point but given that they have a lot of small businesses that export a bit different kinds of cotton good close to the United states I'm sure it's trade related\nAnd and one other question on on just the technical aspects of this it took me a little bit by surprise but I saw the China's going to borrow three billion dollars why are they doing that [noise]\nThey because they basically investors in the west ... assume that a Chinese government that is perfectly sound to us because they have a large a trade surplus\nThey have a three trillion dollars of overseas and foreign exchange and they have not defaulted on any national external debt I'm so it it's a good bet if they can get a decent interest rate they're going to look for overseas capital\nBut why would the Chinese need the money\n[noise] holiday because often uh overseas are willing to pay a ... it's\nExpensive capital and domestically there's a huge amount of debt so they're looking to try to extend that into a new source of the capital overseas it's it's a reasonable strategy\n[noise] the puzzle\nChina is looking for a negotiation with the United states or not the U.S is looking for negotiation with China or not are they in a waiting game Andrew and how long the wait how long before things deteriorate [noise]\nI think the Chinese are more or less given up because the Trump Administration is it's I don't think it's really interested in a settlement\nThere's actually asking the Chinese to change the entire basis of their economy\nWhich the Chinese are are unable to do\nIt would be one thing if the Trump Administration said okay look you've got a you've stolen some of our technology in certain cases you're steel mills are being supported by the government\nEither areas that we think you should focus on instead the Trump they come home and the others make very broad brush statements and the Chinese or think are starting to get to the point where they're washing the hands of the whole thing will figure it's just a political football\nSo say wash their hands what is the timeline does anybody an advantage the timeline does this go on until spring Nineteen spring twenty how long\nI think this is going to go on for a number of years because the Trump Administration as I said it's not going to alter its behavior so far we've not seen that\nAnd the Chinese themselves have figured that until they are going to try to deal with their own domestic economic problems in terms of slowing growth the only thing that I think it help is just a lot of small businesses in America stop start going on or having large unemployment and putting pressure on Trump's base we haven't seen that yet though\nSo Andrew in Hong Kong what is the mood about the Chinese economy long term I'm I get the sense that people are pretty optimistic but where do you use it they are\nPretty optimistic because so far the crash that will do people have been predicting hasn't happened\nAbout the economy is definitely slowing but we're not seeing massive defaults we are seeing an increase in default and corporations and small lenders but not massive default and the leadership is titled script over the riskier banks in the system\nSo so far it's been a kind of a of a gradual decline but no collapse and then you've got that booming tech sector with the huge\nA bite do ten cent hum and other an alley Bobby Amazon of China that are doing very well and doing very well for western investors so that's a a an OK picture\nAnd I get I gather the central bank is basically decided to ease up a little bit on the money supply basically make a little bit more cash available and that has been able to get the country's true right\nThat's exactly it they basically\nExactly they basically after tighten credit for awhile and shutting down riskier pass\nThey now are are starting to open the speaking again and they're hoping to a few close in small businesses will have a lot of employees to keep employment unfortunately it looks like a lot of the credit just going to go to the state for the most inefficient so this is really not good for China's long term a structural growth\nBut it's just the way the Chinese system operates\n[noise] ah we have about a minute Andrew I'm I'm most interested the Chinese confidence believes that the country can grow without an accommodation with the United states is that correct\n[noise] while there say they're not happy about it\nBut she took the president is dealing with you know that\nHe's dealing with um attempt to cut down on pollution he's got a lot of domestic problems and he looking at a trumpet ministry and that hardly knows what it does from day to day so his attitude is if I Can't control it I'm going to happen to deal with what I can control domestically\nSo um they're kind of stuck and uh there's not much more they can do\n... ... is the managing director of the Korean capital research he is in Hong Kong this morning where the

[noise]\nYou know led by the United states must address this night I have to say that the administration's a newly released a national cyber strategy of the United states just release last month\nI is seems to be a being implemented a we just read tonight that are a great effort is going to name\nA the perpetrators of cyber attacks and and uh like minded countries you know when we developed this a cyber deterrence initiative\nAnd aggressively go after the perpetrators a you know in in here from an international law\nCoalition perspective uh that's really what's needed to start putting pressure on these bad actors and so now that we have a new strategy I'm looking to see that our government is is is going to implement it\nAnd it looks like we really are are beginning to implement this new strategy and remember that part of that is uh that that they're taking the gloves off\nA and providing authorities offensive cyber operations which is really key\nDavid I don't know the answer to this so forgive me asking a question I didn't I didn't mention before to the north Koreans work with the Russians and the Iranians in cyber theft\n[noise] uh that's not clear but I it it it certainly would be logical I mean the north Koreans work with the Iranians on a missile technology on nuclear weapons I you know I mean\nYou look at the uh the transfer of technology I and so I I'm sure that there is collaboration then of course I'm not a saint probably with the Russians as well I think all of these hackers and it means people that operate in the cyber realm\nI think they're a they're sharing best practices are and they all learn from each other I Am so they can you know and of course that North Korea does something that's useful\nCan pick up on that and the north Korea one thing we know about them they are very good at learning or from others and so I have no doubt that they're trying to gain any kind of\nA skills and information from the Russians from the Iranians from the Chinese and the you know to improve their capabilities and and so again this is why I really need to focus on this threat\nThirty seconds ... some people say that the best North Korean hackers are trained by the

uh that they have announced accumulation has changed things dramatically in terms of the fortunes for the Republican energized a the coalition for new coalition is that right they can to their their um Fort\nTrump uh this is now I I I Want to remind people that they they ... this this coalition was already building Trump was not the cause of that he was the result of it but they were not they didn't want anything to coalesce around\nUh in in ... and ... in the mid ... they do now and it's not around Trump which I think is a very important distinction they're coming together and they are energized\nOver what they believe is and I I like the tell this and the great revolt is is I'm a ... that culture meaning the big political party the big political systems along with the media and along with pop culture popular culture\nUm are sort of against them and don't understand them and with 'em and and that is the case with ... they believe that it's been heavy handed against him and they projected that on to themselves\n[noise] does that mean turnout models are are are going to change for for and against you see this exciting turnout in Texas or Missouri in North Dakota as well for both sides Selena\nWell ... we're out in the Democrats are already or just to show her already at peak right what we were looking to see was there this populist coalition was going to do it to be energized to come out I'm\nAt I'm for it then it turns ... this has done it\nUm you know now an independence are always sort of where we are not sure where they are but you're both parties are at equal levels and because so many Democrats that are up\nFor reelection in red states that puts them at the un disadvantage to not only will um is Texas and and the story right for Republican either hold and or pick up but I've seen movement in Florida\nAnd Indiana and uh I I I think North Dakota is gone and and I keep an eye on Monday and uh\nYeah but not on line and so this is a\nGame changing moment I mean I you know I feel bad for what the ... family has gone through but it has been the best thing for the Republicans a ... in the in the final weeks of that\nCar Flora good evening to political science here are you I'm On aware helped me teach me is there a political science version of what we've spoken about both the house these last years months that are following a close election the advantages to the party out of power does that work in the Senate as well Laura good evening she\nDid evening John thanks for having me on yes it does work but not as consistently [laughter] so what we do see is that oftentimes the party out of power does pick up seats in the Senate\nBut as I said it's not as consistent and there are times when in fact the president's party does\nDo better and much of that has to do with some of what we're dealing with this time around and that is\nThe class of senators who are up and which party is sort of more on the defensive to begin with as we know in this election the Democrats are incumbents and a number of states that the\nRepublicans won handily in twenty sixteen\nAnd so they're already was a sort of Senate lean toward the Republicans\nWave elections all\nSeats both in the house and Senate tend to fall in one direction and that's where you saw what Celine I was just talking about that you know a few weeks ago people were saying well you know maybe the Senate could in fact\nUm do a little bit better than the Democrats than people are thinking maybe Beto O'Rourke is really in a good place um because those\nSort of wave numbers were starting to be their\nSalinas absolutely right that the Kavanaugh hearings have energize the Republican base but the one I'm cautionary note I Would say is that I'm not certain that in\nOur world today that energy and enthusiasm will stay there for another five weeks in other words\nIt is very possible to me that um Kavanaugh ended up getting confirmed at the end of this week and that by next week you see Republicans um and the enthusiasm that they have this week\nSomewhat more complacent about well we got it it's done the war spending one and you start to then see the Democrats even more upset and enraged by the fact that Kavanaugh's nomination went through\nSo I'm not sure where we're going to be a couple of weeks from now I also think it's important to realize that when we do look at the polling um there is\nEssentially a reality that more independence both men and women uh believe a Dr Ford than believe a judge Kavanaugh it is also true that um\nThat when you look at just women independence um the beliefs are around Ford's testimony over Kavanaugh's was fifty six percent to twenty four percent so\nYou know there is going to be a very interesting shakeout of who are we talking about as the swing voters because white\nWomen college educated um Republicans may not stay with I'm sort of the Republicans and Kavanaugh and\nThey may in fact I'm uphold more of Ford's testimony\nOr detail here we just have thirty seconds or so for both of you of the house is uh is or isn't a trajectory to go to the Democrats and the next week says the term all going to affect us all you know just about Fifteen seconds you see the turmoil\nUh also bumping the house or is that on a glide path to lay\nYou still think I see a Republican or Democrat skating at least seven at this moment um all the way up to thirty five I think at the end of the day were anywhere between ... by either side in the majority\nOf Laura ... the turmoil here that you just noted you know next week will be a new new scandal is the out is the house settling into concrete what are these metaphors you you like in Washington so the ... is a cake bake so I think that's what I like best or is this still in play [noise]\nDon't know that that cake is yet baked but I Do believe that just as Selina was saying this cabin on hearing I'm kind of woke up a lot of president\nPresident Trump's base especially those um blue collar workers I think it is also true that ... it has distanced more college educated suburban women and that will matter in the house races\nLara Brown of George Washington university Salinas detailed the Washington Examiner I'm John bachelor this that the bachelor show\nWell my point nine SNL\nSummer's over what what ... means the money for you when you were share one thousand dollars four times\nAnd the response is if you got arguments that are so good just make them and they should be able to win by the force of the argument\nBut the differences and the old regime if you had an agency with a bad argument then somebody found a student or you know with a good argument\nYou could follow the good argument now on the ... you have to follow the bad argument even if you think it's wrong and so you see case after case doing this and Gorsuch and cabinet started essentially with the following very simple proposition as a constitutional matter let alone statutory matter\nYou're looking at the situation and you know courts is supposed to decide questions of wall and executive branches are not supposed to do that\nAnd so we think that sometimes the basic principle of separation of powers\nThe point is sufficiently strong that even if they decided to change the text of the administrative procedure act which has been constant since Nineteen forty six they would say you could not do it so the stakes are very on on this particular question and I think that the\nGorsuch cabinet position is\nCorrect about long held that particular view but it used to be a voice crying in the wilderness and now it turns out that we're getting closer to the point where this doctrine may be toppled\n... Richard I want I Want to use an example here and see if I understand is I'll let you have to clean Air Act a which allowed the EPA to interpret the law claiming this was ambiguous and therefore here's our ruling you said that it permitted the EPA did say that if you have a piece of equipment and you want to upgrade it\nThat is permitted if the amount of pollution doesn't change that's what that's what the ruling is in this instance however\nThe question is what's a piece of equipment rice and you know there's a bit of a philosophical puzzle here is this half the heat but heath is a part of a piece of equipment a piece of equipment\nAnd his factory something you can upgrade without having to ask for new permits and go through the process of the\nDemocratic rule no the moment you decided to shift the amount of emissions from one smokestack to another you have to start over this could be years\nAnd and that is that partisanship out of the uh the Chevron acting and it would change from administrative ... that's exactly what was feared and it and it happens\nIt happens in this particular case\nAnd my view about it is that the stability of expectations that you want out of law means that you should have judges decide these things\nAnd if they're going to build a rule that's going to be buying an act of Congress or in some cases where the agency may do so they could change the administrative rule in one form or another but it is generally understood when you start to change these rules on an ad hoc basis retroactive application\nIs suspect politically there's a lot of resistance and at least before the recent Chevron doctrine um it was generally thought that um are there would be legal problems I should put Chevron context or because at the same time that the courts would dealing with Chevron what we did is we had a number of cases\nInvolving a question of whether or not when the government made a deal with people you joined this particular pension fund and if you don't think that we're doing things correctly you can pull out without recrimination the argument was that you know\nThat when a government agency says something it is perfectly foreseeable that they will not can keep their work\nSo when you make your decision you have to assume that these guys may well be acting in bad faith and so long as it's the ... are you are bound by the change in decision now the whole principle of the rule of law as we know that government officials can act in bad faith\nAnd so the reason we protect ourselves against retroactive changes with massive wells consequences is to make sure that they don't the fact that it's for see that this thing will happen if you let them go\nIs the strongest reasons for saying you will never let them go so this is in the middle the Reagan Administration and what happens is it turns out that there is a remarkably low threshold\nFor the protection of vested rights they don't protect them at all and this whole situation creates all sorts of uncertainty in the way in which government or to run and the Republicans have been as much to blame for months of this is the defendants\nAnd there's a story for example about Nina Scully there's a case called outweigh you eat on and what it did is that involved the question of how we define certain kinds of police officers and uh the department of labor under Clinton came up with the obviously absurd position that date a sergeant or lieutenants\nThere was no and the minister later and executive or a professional under the fair labor standards act and therefore is titled over time and you just go spend three minutes looking at the definition of their duties and of course there overseeing patrol that at one level and Justice Scalia wrote it opinion which says well you know\nThis is the way things on the big city it looks to me like it's perfectly sensible not going to strike down they know more about this subject than I Do this is across the street political move by democratic department of labor and\nYou know several years later Twenty years later it was you know Fifteen Years later just before he died a flu is hertz is crazy hours ... couldn't answer was heated\nI'm speaking with Richard up seeing the Hoover Institution we're discussing Chevron and Chevron ease the administrative state and it is right now a question that will come up before the Supreme Court if it contains both\nThe justice Gorsuch and potential justice Kevin ... however there are two other cases that Richard teaches me that we can discuss about property rights when we
