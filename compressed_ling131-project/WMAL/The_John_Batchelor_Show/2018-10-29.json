financial markets source sponsor online training academy generous countries make this show has [noise] online training\nAcademy has been helping individuals like you become do it yourself investor since Nineteen Ninety seven online training Academy of two campuses to serve our listening audience one and Tyson's corner one near BWI Airport\nAnd I saw funny commercial this week it was from allied bank and it was talking about the biggest bank heist ever [noise] and it wasn't talking about a robbery\nAt least from a bank it was talking about how banks are basically robbing individuals' of a fair amount of interest\nAnd this idea that you know our back is trying to show that they're you know they're being so much nicer to their clients so instead of offering you one percent on your money they're offering you two percent or some other small amount and it goes to\nWhat we've been talking about here on the do yourself investors show for a long time\nIs that you know that's fun for a little bit of your money but there's no way that putting your money in a bank or using these other financial services\nOffers are ... are going to help you actually generate the income you need to live the life you want\nAnd so you know the biggest bank job ever was you know it's happening now but it really started about ten years ago and I was watching I was on HBO and I was watching a show called too big to fail\nAnd it was an HBO movie that was focused on what happened back in two thousand and eight\nAnd it was about the the Federal Reserve and the Treasury's efforts to bases save\nThe banking system\nSaves the modern financial system and it it it was kind of an interesting portrait of kind of behind the scenes of you know what were what were the government folks consider at the Treasury Department and he'll ... what were the what were the things that they were really a ...\nUh what were what were the government folks consider at the Treasury Department and he'll ... what were the what were the things that they were really afraid of and and being that we're at the tenth anniversary of that\nI thought it was pretty pretty interesting to see that because they were worried about the total collapse of the global financial system and\nZero for a seven to three\nAll now to claim receive in your free half day class\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills or even just having the luxury of not working so hard\nTo have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share but there's all kinds of stories here's what one recent graduate had to say\nHi bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different needed my time I needed by life\nAnother student says ... ... and career and training something that I had always wanted to death and sell it at a ... at a chemical or start that changed my life I've\nLearned more visit us on line that free O T a class dot com that's free OT a class dot com\nWelcome back to the ... herself investor show and a lot of things to say on the side and for a walk us through how we can use the tools are being do yourself investor and if we understand how the market's really work\nWe can use the same strategies that the professional\nBanks their views on us and then charges the high fee to take advantage of\nBecause you know there's there's a time in life when it happened annuity makes a lot of sense there's a time in life where to get that steady stream is really beneficial and but at the same time if you learn how to do it yourself\nYou don't have to pay the commissions you know an annuity is the highest commission product out there in the financial services industry and sometimes as basic ten percent right off the top\nAnd then on top of that on an annual basis you know they're charging fees ... four to seven percent per year\nWhereas if you learn how to do it yourself you'd have to pay some fee some expenses related to it but no fees and you'd be able to preserve the benefit of your assets that you've worked so hard for\nFor you as well as for your family and for your legacy and so part of going to do is start sinking bigger about the opportunities that are out there\nAnd you know the financial services folks have been a great job of beating down your expectations and get need to be happy and making three four or five percent on your money\nYou know as they do it yourself investor we want to find more productive uses for assets you know we're going to start looking at ourselves like a business and making businesslike decisions with our money and if we're going to make a business like decision we're going to look for productive uses of our assets you know double and triple digit opportunities [noise]\nAnd so this week one of our students ray hey walk me through kind of how he had identified an opportunity using his method [noise]\nKind of turns out it was the same opportunity that a number of other students talk and so they were part of a user group and they were sharing what they had done that week and there were three students including re who each took this opportunity based on the\nThe proven system they learn to be online training academy based on their own individualized\nOf the proven system and re had done was in the course of take it was about an hour he made about seven thousand dollars with his account and to do that he needed to have\nProbably about Fifteen thousand dollars in his account and so that was a pretty good return for that day\nAnd part of this as realizing that you know if you have the right tools and understand the power of your assets the return you can get is a lot greater than what you've been led to believe\nBut you need to learn professional skills professional tools they need to get probability leverage and risk reward on your side and so if you want to learn more about getting probability laboratory scored on their side come visit us on Saturday November third of Pan Am going to be home with the sweets in Springfield [noise]\nSo if you're you know ... down Ninety five or over in Alexandria over and Fort Washington he'll come visit us at home with sweets in Springfield also Saturday November third will be at the online training academy in Baltimore which is right on for one hundred between Ninety five and two Ninety five\nWill also be the online training academy and Tyson's corner to take advantage of these ...\nWhich is right for one hundred between Ninety five and two Ninety five will also be at the online training academy and Tyson's corner so take advantage of these opportunities where you can start identifying bigger and better ways for you to be able to generate income in the market\nAlso Thursday November first as part of our outreach efforts were going to be in Germantown, Maryland also so out two Seventy world's going to be an Alexandria so give yourself a opportunity to learn is becoming a do it yourself investor the right fit for me\nOn friday November second we're going to be out west in Dallas corner they're all going to be in Columbia town center and so we're expanding our outreach because there's been such an outcry of support people recognize who they just need to make more income\nAnd particularly with the holidays coming up people are going to you know they're going to see it on their credit cards they're going to see it\nYou know their holiday spending\nAnd realize that they just need to make more money as we head into the new year and you ask yourself is do you have a real income strategy for two thousand Nineteen [noise]\nIf you don't have an income strategy that you're comfortable with it oh to yourself to explore is becoming a do it yourself investor a good fit in two thousand Nineteen as well as for the rest of your life\nBecause part of what we wanted to do is we are looking for people that are motivated we're looking for people that are co trouble people that want to make a change and realize they don't know it all\nAnd the coach will means that you're accepting that they're someone might know more than you\nAnd to be successful in life you know there's a lot of people go through\nYou know thinking they know it all well if you know at all then whatever you have is as good as you're going to get and if you want to do better you have to open your mind to learning and you have to be comfortable and realize that there's other people out there that may be able to help you be more effective\nAnd so if you're a coach ... we want to meet you\nAnd if your coach herbal involved with investing and if your coach will regarding income then become do yourself investors definitely something that you want to learn about\nWe're also looking for people that are motivated people that have that fire in the belly that\nWant to make a change that believe in themselves but just don't have that platform they just don't have that avenue where they can use their talents to generate the income they want for the rest of their life\nAnd they're part of this or just believing in yourself if you got that motivation if you've got that fire in the belly you could really benefit from learning the skill of becoming a ... herself investor and understanding the playing field understanding of the rules of the game\nAnd also understanding what are your opponents doing to you\nSo you're not able to take it being taken advantage of by them in a big part of our proven system it'd be able to recognize where do the institutions want to buy and what are the institutions want to sell\nAnd because they're so big you know they leave footprints in the market and so we're going to be able to identify the prices that they think is a good price to buy at and the price of they think are a good price to sell out and if we keep that in mind that allow us to make safer and smarter decisions with our money [noise]\nWorld's going to learn how to leverage our assets so basically how to use our assets to\nBecome more powerful because if we're going to be a do it yourself investor [noise] we have to realize the power that we have the and put it into action and as the on the risk reward side we're going to make sure for any risk we take\nWe have the opportunity to make a greater reward and this is how we're going to magnify or opportunities and move away from these unproductive strategies and find some more productive uses for our money and more important more productive uses for our time to generate the income we need to live the life we want\nAnd so part of the success plan that we help folks developed it starts with identifying what is it you're trying to accomplish and why\nAnd for a lot of people that come to us and some things happened in their life and it's just the realization that you know I'm going to retire and a couple of years or\nI'm afraid I'm going to lose my job or there's some major shift in my industry and I can see that this type of work is being eliminated because it's happening over and over again and what we want you to do is to prepare for that not to be afraid of it\nBut to accept the reality that changes coming\nAnd it's your responsibility no changes neither good or bad it's your responsibility to make the best of the change that's coming and whether it's you know just to supplement your income now or anticipating that you're going to need more income in the future you know to pay for your daughter's wedding\nTo provide for your kids' education to take care of your parents you know identifying these future income needs\nYou know to pay for your daughter's wedding to provide for your kids' education to take care of your parents\nYou know identifying these future income needs are going to give you the focus and the motivation to learn how to get more out of your assets because for most people unless you've got ten you know millions and millions of dollars\nYou know three four five percent of the year is not going to get it done\nYou can listen then we're losing our ... said they were to do a group dot com that's Eric steward group dot com and I'll look forward to seeing you Sunday Morning eight o'clock right here on WMA\nWe would be now when you're indoors\nWelcome back Jon Erickson joins me again or John good to see you and thanks for joining me\nTo be here John I'm In\nContinuing care retirement communities you have a life plan style community where you Internet an entrance fee which is you might bring in a large sum of money from the sale of a property got families as you say who are middle America who don't have that many options were not seen that development I'm seen more\nRental communities coming up that are just popping up on you know ten acre parcels might serve a hundred and fifty to two hundred and fifty people are where you're not coming in with the lifestyle entrance fee of what you pay a higher monthly fee what's your perception an evaluation of that\n[noise] um I think that's a little bit of a fall back from the fact that the capital markets quit developing\nIn the in the uh and you know the the\nDeposit based are CRC market so if you're not really having any access to existing communities the rental market is kind of popping up as the next alternative ah and building in a hundred and fifty unit increment\nA it stays finance of below along the lines of the memory care and the assisted living they fill up fairly fast they tend to attract a uh the lower end of the market or the middle income market rather than the higher end\nUh and it's ... it's particularly attractive to people that have died of her being homeowners\nAre and have mostly rented all their life because they were maybe in the military or they were you know a school teachers that traveled every summer and they didn't have equity housing it's very attractive to the to that market of [noise]\nBut the long term suburban homeowner who has all this equity is still a hard thing for them to get their hands around because it means moving out of the house putting of chunk of money in the bank and then using a lot more money than you are used to rent every month and have your services\nWhereas the Shiites the model if you're moving some home equity your monthly costs tend to be about the same as they would have been if you were in the home and you haven't changed that huge spending patterns\nSo it's kind of a ... it's a market is developing in my opinion because ah we're not developing any other alternatives at this point or are they are very few alternatives\nTo across the country are there more or the mortgage starting to open up to that or they still go holding back there's basically the capital markets are saying no we're not willing to do that\nSo the capital markets are still not coming back into the the ... the housing that I was doing for Thirty years uh it's it's been a few places that are trying to restart that will have to see in the next five years whether they can get a a new start in the CRC side\nBut the rental market is the next alternative it seems to be picking up people a couple of years older\nPeople wait a little bit longer to make that move and there are a little closer to the edge\nAnd show they're picking up what I call the pre assisted living market where people know it's coming I might have another two to three years before I have to make that assisted living move but in the meantime I'm going to get into a more service friendly senior market and so that's what I'm seeing out of it\nBut it's tending to be in a in the eighties range of ah of moving so\nUh and I think I think it's a natural social reaction to where we are right now with the supply and demand and the industry\nDrew John you're pretend with me for a moment that you are looking to make a move into a retirement community\nCould you give me five maybe five\nQuestions that you might ask a retirement community before you moved in\n... obviously I'd want to know what their financial operating structure is and uh what level of a stability they have in terms of the business side of their their model I'd like to know who their sponsor and managing ideas in what their credibility is um and\nThen I'd like to know that uh what level of\nHunter and managing ideas in what their credibility is um and\nThen I'd like to know that a level of of services are they going to have for a later time care as opposed to for instance uh [noise] you know the holiday retire retirement or a system as a hundred unit buildings or rent\nA dining room social structure but they don't have any health related activity and so when you get to stage yet you need the next step of healthcare it mean another move and and so you want to know what state you know health care are going to be in the community because\nIt gets harder and harder to move and particularly when the circumstances are getting tougher relative to\nDeteriorate of aging mhm and so I Would definitely ask about sponsor of the financial structures a stable it is what services they're delivering\nAnd I think you know if you got community in your area should be able to make a decision off of those kind of question\nMhm those are three excellent questions [noise] ah so you you if you're if you've got the backbone answered you're satisfied by that than the rest of it as far as you're concerned is more just how they would serve your lifestyle would you say that's right\nI think today a lot of the decision is made by the lifestyle choice after you've done all this financial and other stuff you're going to pick a community that probably relates to your kids and grandkids or your church or something that is really important in this stage of your life\nAnd what I'm seeing today is more and more people are moving to be near grand kids than I've seen in the last Twenty years\nI Would agree with that and they're making ... double news sometimes they'll move twice we've had people move from Chicago to Denver and our campuses because kids moved to Denver and they're going to move\n[laughter] following your kids\nAnd they don't want to live within a mood narrow\nSo they can continue the relationship I think that that does make sense it's it's really wonderful when the kids will move near mom and dad but it's more typical that the parents have the freedom to make that move\nA and because Erickson guy has got a lot of communities you have a lot of opportunity for that very well John thanks for joining me Jon Erickson the founder of the arts and communities are loved
