bombing attacks\nOn Democrats across the country the latest with regard to this spate of quote unquote attempted male bombing is that it is possible that the bombs themselves are not actually structured to detonate\nSo olive punted over at hot air right judging by some by social media Glenn and a piece story and thought it was claimed the explosive powder inside the bomb was harmless not so\nA package than CNN and pain to pipe bomb in and on top of the mystery powder inside it's mystery power that's harmless\nThe bombs themselves are supposedly workable and functional if crude although there are other report\nThat suggests that the bombs lacked the detonator and so this was either a test run or a hoax or something else like that we're still waiting more information and that is the mood today awaiting more information yesterday I thought there were a bunch of folks who jumped to the false flag explanation no I'm not claiming\nThat you're not allowed to speculate inside your own head as to who you think of this or that you're not allowed to wonder whether there's enough information to get on one side or the other what I Am saying is if you are one hundred percent sure this is a false flag he went right there like right away he just wants to this is probably the Democrats helping themselves\nThat's not good okay you shouldn't be using confirmation bias doesn't substitute for evidence and this is true in so many cases in our politics I Can't even tell you I've been saying this for years I mean I remember when with Michael Brown case Michael Brown black guy shot by a cop an\nEnormous swab the entire law basically said this is a case of police racism and brutality in which a man was shot in the back because he was black\nAnd I said well let's wait for evidence and then the evidence came out and it turns out that wasn't the story at all or here if you're jumping to either this is Democrats' helping themselves or this is Donald Trump planting bombs in the mailbox Gilbert CNN\nLet me suggest you that you're totally full of crap you\nKnow I Know you don't know yet because no one knows yet\nI don't know yet you don't know yet presto no yet and

I think much more correctly she says CNN is choosing to divide and attack\nHe tweeted out President Trump asked Americans to come together and saying one very clear strong unmistakable message that act or threats of political violence betting kind of no place in the usa you chose to divide and attack America should unite against all political violence\nAnd that is correct that is correct and I don't understand why President Trump is getting back for saying the right thing at that at that rally or at the at the White House and then he is getting back on the other side when he when he goes after the media anyway in any case CNN demonstrating full scale\nThat they are going to go with his narrative right they never went with his narrative with Iran to Bernie Sanders they never went with his narrative with regard to\nDating full scale that they are going to go with the narrative right they never went with us here in the ... and ... with his narrative with regard to me the attempted attack on Susan Collins or they aren't going to go full scale with these tax\nOn President Trump's a hair skin is Gloria borders are saying you know Trump targets in it a coincidence President Trump kept a bunch of people and then those people get ... bomb mail bombs you know we do in politics we attack people on the other side and their and their ideas\nTo say there is no kitten actually reaching what Trump is said about don't re Clinton Brock Obama or a cold or John Brennan and soon and and the view of the person who sent those type bombs is foolhardy how do you know that you don't know that\nHe doesn't know that because he doesn't know thing everybody assumes the worst on behalf of everybody else and instead of saying there's a difference between he'd political rhetoric and violent political rhetoric we just jump in with both the Democrats are even worse than the media and that's because the Democrats are absolutely hypocritical him sir so Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer put out a statement\nOn that are on on these attempted bombing and here is what they said there's emily's an audio recording over a daily wire\nShe says Senate minority leader Senator Chuck Schumer and house minority leader Nancy Pelosi lashed out at president Donald Trump in a statement released Wednesday afternoon a pair jointly condemned the statement from the president should earlier in the day expressing his concerns over a series of suspected explosive devices sent the prominent Democrat thinking\nWe listened with great interest in the president's remarks this afternoon we'll take an oath to support and defend the constitution and protect the American people\nAnd that is our first responsibility however President Trump's words ring hollow until he reverses his statements that can do an act of violence\nTime and again the president has condoned physical violence and divided Americans with his words and actions expressing support for the congressman body slammed reporter the neo Nazis killed a young woman in Charlottesville his importance of rallies who get violent with protesters dictators around the world who murder their own citizens and referring to the free press as the enemy of the people\nNow I think President Trump and a lot about stuff how 'bout that unclear about this but you're actually going to blame him for this bombing ... this is what you're going to do now I can remember somebody Nancy Pelosi just about a year and a half ago who was asked about Steve Scully nearly being shot to death he almost died\nOkay he was in critical condition he almost died it's a miracle that live here is Nancy Pelosi saying how dare you blame us or Bernie Sanders for heated rhetoric that could've been connected with the guy going on to a baseball field and shouting as he gunning down members of Congress\nAbout health care that's Rudy was doing he was he was standing there screaming about health care while I'm kind of murder members of Congress there was an some policies response time she was right then she's not right now what's the difference now she gets to target right winners\nHow dare they say such a thing how dare they ahead to this individual does something despicable and it was horrible what he did hateful but for them to all the sudden they sanctimonious and see if they don't never seen such a thing before it's\nJust it's it's just amazing so she's reverse I mean I Wonder what changed outlook changed as he was going to get one that's what change so there is no such thing as a sword that cuts both ways all we have in the United states at this point are a bunch of habits I blunt on one end directed toward you and sharp on the other end directed toward your opponent\nWe don't recognize that what we're actually holding in a store and if you use it on your opponent can easily be turned back on you\nStore and has to adjust but according to the left it's just the hatchet and you can bury it in the twin shoulder blades if your political opponents Hillary Clinton does the same thing so many former first lady senator presidential candidate she says wasn't as an American I'm worried about the level of our rhetoric\nSay well as a person I'm grade as an American I'm worried\nI worry about the direction of our countries\nI worry about what kind of world will be waiting for them when they're\nTeenagers and young adults and beyond\nOkay and it wasn't just Hillary Clinton thing as her top aide fleet brains who is really one of most vicious people in American politics he was on MSNBC and he explicitly just blame President Trump's rhetoric for all of this\nThis is someone who has a weaponized Trump's\nTwitter feed and made it into a hit list he is addicted to their response and their response they are addicted to his um betrayal\nOkay so next time somebody who's a big Hillary Clinton fan decides to go and shoot up an office one day to Fox News studio but I guess we can blame Hillary Clinton because after all I recall when a minute ago one minute ago Hillary Clinton was saying you cannot be civil what the other side\nIt as it were generally what the day today today is the twenty fifth okay so what's your name at least once you ... ... fourteen days ago Fifteen days ago Hillary Clinton said that\nCannot be civil with a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about that's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that's when civility can start again\nThat's why I Believe if we are fortunate enough to win back the house and or the Senate that twin civility can start again but until then the only thing that the Republican theme to recognize and respect is strength\nHey everybody is completely full of crap everyone is completely full of crap will get to the fullest of the craft\nIn just one second but first let's talk about what you do to get ready every evening I Love the dollar shave has everything I Need to look steel and smell my

and they said listen we have to turn down the temperature in this country it has to start at the top\nWeird I remember when bill de Blasio was saying the police officers weren't just shooting black and for no reason and I remember when Andrew Cuomo the governor of New York so that everyone who disagrees with him on policy should get out of the state that is not an exaggeration he said that there is no place in the state of New York for you if you don't believe in same sex marriage and his views on social issues\nLet me explain if you are sitting around today and uh going it's always the rhetoric on the other side that the problem\nBy a freaking near\n... everybody has a role in temping down some of the rhetoric here\nEverybody does and that also means that\nBlaming the other side and suggesting that the other side of responsible for violence is leading to a worst country\nIt's so funny everybody thinks they're fighting violence when they suggest the other side is responsible for violence when they just use mainstream political rhetoric you're actually increasing the chances of violence when you do that because you are hitting everything up your suggesting the other side is so evil at the very ... of their ideas is likely to lean to death chaos and destruction\nThat isn't that that's an on American perspective on American\nBernie Sanders' can say whatever the hell he want no matter how wrong he is and among his actively saying go should people on the congressional baseball feel that it's not his fault and Donald Trump can say whatever he wants and you don't have to like it or whatever Donald Trump says\nHe has the right to say that so long as he is not saying go beat up somebody right now go bomb someplace right now if I found weary of all of us just because I Am weary of all this really I mean if we're going to have any sort of level headed conversation when it has to stop blaming each other for every crazy person who does a crazy thing\nIs you know folks really really ... let's not making the country worst place in other news\nNBC News is actively hyping this Megan Kelly blackface thing and it's really stupid it's really stupid speaking of stupidity in politics to Megan Kelly we talked about the length yesterday Megan Kelly said on a show that she doesn't really understand why this woman who was in the real housewives of whatever why this woman\nWas in trouble for dressing up as Diana Ross at a party because when she was a kid people used the dark and their skin for Halloween costumes in wasn't a big deal and a bunch of folks that well blackface has along in a glorious history in the United states that's insensitive shit you know what I learned something today that's insensitive I was wrong\nThat seemed like after the end of story does anyone really believes making Kelly's approval vicious are racist they don't actually believe that\nOf course nobody believed that nobody actually believe that Megan Kelly thinks black people are inferior genetically and black people are worse black people are morally culpable at a higher level than white people or any of that no one actually believe that but NBC and it just shows you that capitalism when used by bad people\nYou know is not great OK NBC wants to get rid of making Kelly they want to get rid of making Kelly because they tried to push Megan Kelly into a box that is not properly fitted for Megan Kelly\nMay and Kelly is an excellent interviewer she's an excellent question her she's a former lawyer and prosecutor that is where her role as best they tried to fit her into the Katie Couric fluff morning news routine and that didn't work for them and so the ratings were not good and so they had signed her to an inordinate amount of money\nAnd now they're trying to push out the door how are they doing that by\nAccident by actively stoking racial resentment in the United states and its ugly stuff NBC News is now saying they're going to take the episodes of making the show this week and then they're going to stick to terminate her contract based on her saying that she didn't understand what the big deal was about somebody darkening their face for Halloween costume\nDoes anyone really believe that the NBC bras is really upset about that or their boycott is on his way or that this was actually vicious brutal KKK style racism they would actually think that no\nReally upset about that or their boycott is on his way or that this was actually vicious brutal KKK style racism they actually think that no of course not this is just NBC News trying to stoke racial resentment for purposes of being able to fire somebody\nOr they the head of NBC News Andy lack he openly ... into Kelly after she apologized ship college rides and lack that there is no other way to put this but I condemn those remarks there is no place on our air or in the workplace for them very unfortunate and then Lester Holt cover her comments on NBC nightly news\nThere is a a

before the election but again in the absence of evidence I'm not going to go there and I don't think anybody else can go there either we should not be moving based on\nAgain no evidence was

I Know the last round of sanctions twist um did cut off a number of Iranian banks and so that's what the U.S is seeking to see again um at least in part\nA what we saw then was that there are other ways to send messages and in fact a without the underlying relationships between banks that messaging services don't mean very much so if you think of the email analogy I could send you an email um but if you don't know me or don't want to have a relation\nDon't mean very much so if you think of the email analogy I could send you an email um but if you don't know me or don't want to have a relationship with me or not necessarily going to respond to it so it's not the way in which funds or move it's just the way in which messages sent\n'em if you look at when the sanctions relief was put in place is another good way to consider it\nSo a lot of of of people thought that when Iran was given access again to the swift platform that it would be like turning on a switch and all of a sudden Iranian banks it'd be reconnected to the international financial system but of course that we didn't see that\nA lot of things were were wary to reconnect with Iran a for a variety of reasons that were uh in some way it's related to sanctions overhang but it related to all kinds of other concerns in dealing dealing with Iran and so does underlying relationships didn't necessarily materialize\nWhat we've seen since the U.S withdrawal from the uh the Iran deal and may is that even those banks that did re engage most of them have\nSince withdrawn those relationships are so it doesn't it doesn't necessarily matter as much if not a silver bullet\nUm if the banks won't uh aren't willing to do that the business anyway and I think that that actually the announcement this special purpose vehicle that Europeans have have said they're going to put in place um to try to maintain a financial linkage with Iran when the sanctions reimpose\nKind of an individual indication and acknowledgement um that those banks with or without swift aren't going to do it and they're trying to find an alternative even though it's essentially a barter system that they're proposing\nTo them not likely to be very effective given their past records but ... two things one we know that Iran will look for ways to evade any kind of restrictions\nSo we see you know on the world where they're they're trying to disable do tracking system oldest fleet so you don't see the destinations volumes and you want some swift also immune for us to track\nThe money flowing unit of Ron so those who raised concern that we're going to lose that information you know valuable information for tracking the rains ... is in real terms of the means to do so\n[noise] so uh first I think that that some of the the the conversation around losing access to to to tracking Iranian activity it's it's a little bit of a a a Garbo and there's there's two things that are apples and oranges there is a program called the terror finance tracking um\nI'm Sorry to hear that the terrified of tracking program that uh that the Treasury Department administers and has since uh shortly after nine eleven um through which they receive a information from swift under subpoena that can be searched to look for terrorist financing activity\nUm and that's that's a separate kind of program ah\nThis this and that continued when a Iran was taken off of swift previously under the previous round of sanctions\nUm so I think that those are two issues that are getting mixed but but on the issue of rainy invasion of of course first of all there's other ways that they can send these messages and that they did last time whether it's by facts or email or any way just to to signal that they want to move funds from here to their\nBanks that are willing to take the sanctions risk of dealing with Iran um you know after November fifth are probably going to do so regardless of whether or not Iran is on the switch program just as you do go ahead\nNo no I I I don't want us to run out of time and we did not ask about the efficacy of the sanctions so far\nMost she was she did address the in the in your opening about the first round I mean we we tried to keep track of the companies that are pulled out we've tried to report because people don't know would you judge the effort to see the first round of sanctions is successful and really impacting the target useful\nSo I think that's a really important question and we as we approach November of it because I've I think one of the thing to remember is that there were these two Ninety Days and a hundred and eighty day wind down periods and what that meant is that business has had that period to to to complete any business that had been allowed that they were doing\nAnd that a lot of of firms acted very quickly after the announcement and end with drill and so I'm In terms of of assessing the ethic of see it but I think you've already seen a lot of pressure um\nThat that's going to be brought to bear through all the first year the sanctions that went back in place um August ... well before then just this you're going to you you know we've probably seen a lot of the impact\nUm that we're going to see a ads of November fifth ah because this activity should have a already stopped and in fact\nBecause this idea of sanctions snap back within which was written into the J. C. P. away perhaps not foreseen and that's the way up but most terms that that that would have re engaged would have had plans on the shelves to put in place to to quickly wind down to business\nGoverned

things things shift and of course in the middle east\nThings change pretty quickly but I think what what needs to never changes or is this strong bond between the the us in Israel and I and I will say that [noise] you know a President Obama my had differences with Iran as you pointed out\nBut where it came to a to helping Israel with with with funding um he was right there and we've always\nHad a uh for the past twenty or Thirty years we've always had a both presidents from both sides of the aisle bipartisan to even the\nThe relationship and that's really what I Want I Want to say and that's what we did it again the foreign affairs committee and it doesn't mean we never had a different differences of opinion but we did respectfully and we were able to always compromise so we were able to come out I remember there was one sanctions bill during the December twenty Thirteen\nAnd we passed unanimously out of the foreign affairs committee or that people like Tea Party people from the from the rights of all the way to uh extreme of a progressive uh on on the left\nAnd everybody voted for it and we did it because we handed out and we we we we moved ahead and we talked a lot about Israel and the United states and I'm going to keep doing it I I Know that it's going to be some some difficulty but I'm I'm ready for the challenge and I have a lot to say I've been working this issue for a long time and\nI look forward to sitting down with all of my colleagues in trying to help convince them that Israel is the best friend we have in the\nMiddle a it is true that you are very very and very likely to be the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee if your party a successful in the mid term but I'm not certain that that's doing anybody ... you're going to inherit Syria\nWith Russia turkey and the Assad mercenaries bringing it lip province and I'm told that that can turn extremely violent we also have American troops in Syria greatly at risk because the Iranians want that highway to Haiti's\nFrom Iran all the way too full evidence\nYou're also going to inherit the quandary of\nAh the Palestinians failure the Palestinian failure on ... and in the west bank you're going to be on the road a lot Eliot if your chairman of the house foreign affairs committee [noise]\nWell I'm I'm I'm hoping I'm ready for the task I Know I Am have my sleeves rolled up and look there are lots of problems you mentioned some of them Syria breaks my heart when you look and you see the human tragedy the\nHundreds of thousands of people a Syrian citizens who were just murders and killed by Assad and his henchmen with the backing of Iran with the backing of Russia um ... it's just something that just just has got to break your heart from a from a human the point of view and\nI'm with it when I done obviously there's still there's so many many difficulties with with Syria and many many difficulties that's why it's important I think for the United states to continue to ah to talk to all sides and to to have a working relationships with ah with countries\nWant more detail ... one more detailed Eliot the American embassy is now in Jerusalem does that make it easier to deal with the Palestinians your measure\n[noise] well to tell you the truth or John I don't think it ... makes it easier or or harder um we we passed a law uh which I voted for twenty three years ago a which is that the embassy be moved\nTo Jerusalem and there was a wave rent it and every president since then used a waiver um and the President Trump and I have many disagreements with him but President Trump to his credit\nI'm signed it to a signed the move and then didn't use the waiver and I think when Congress shows ... and into intend to go in a certain direction I just don't think it should be disregarded and these were bipartisan it was it was for several years\nAnd um I I think that it's where it belongs now for Palestine\nThese were bipartisan it was it was several years and um I I think that it's where it belongs now for Palestinians and the leadership really wants peace [noise]\nIt it shouldn't have any effect on it um [noise] you need to just sit down and you can't have have an agreement if people won't even come to a va negotiating table and whatever one thinks of a two state solution and I still favor two state solution [noise]\nUm the fact of the matter is that giving all these negotiations since Oslo Israel was ready on two occasions\nTo sign a peace treaty with the Palestinians won't undue could the rocket went on to ... and both times you know first it was Arafat and then it was a boss who said no show this nonsense about somehow Israel is the impediment to beef it's quite the opposite\nCould you give us a quick assessment you chairman of the western hemisphere do you think South America relations will improve that we can counter the Iranian growing influence there thirty seconds out\nOkay yes I answer is yes I think it's very important to you know we're obviously in the western hemisphere with our friends in Latin America or we have a lot in common and uh there's there's a lot that we can do\nAnd we should do it when we were last in the majority I was chairman of the western hemisphere subcommittee and we made a lot of strides in in in making the relationship between the U.S\nAnd these other countries are a ... closer together so yes I think there's a lot we can do I intend to be very active\nAnd and work with ... with people to to make sure that the United states or goes on the right course and uh [noise]\nI look forward to a to

this is Patrick very careful reporting so he's forty years old he's a member of the forty nine\nThey're very early into the war they arrive in June of Nineteen Seventeen to train but it is now the summer of Nineteen Eighteen\nBut this is an event that you've heard about on the on the edges of history class called Bello would Patrick take us into Bello would in June of Nineteen eight\nJune of Nineteen Eighteen the French Army is melting away as the the the um\nThe example that they use is that\nIt's like rain on a hot hot iron it just evaporates and the ... the French Army as evaporating it in front of a massive German offensive that is directed it directly at Paris\nAnd looting dark means to win the war right now yes and the only units that are you know in ready reserve and that are willing to fight 'em is or the Americans the second and the third infantry wretch a division specifically the second\nWhich includes the force brigade which is a Marine Corps brigade\nAnd the the Marines are are shifted into Bella would hurt in that sector they dig in behind the fleeing French and this is a very important fact the French were just taking whatever forces that they had in immediately throwing them into battle\nBut the the commander of the the second insisted that the cheapest Avon sister that we dig in behind and not be thrown in piecemeal and this and potentially was a war saving maneuver\nThe general ... says since he'd been arguing the politics of this for some time because the British commander headache and the French commander foe she wanted to cut up the Americans and feed them into the weak divisions that were holding the line against the Germans that summer and Pershing had refused\nIt's just part of that that's part of the macro but on the very tactical level the chief of staff of the second division a colonel brown insisted that we dig in behind the French and we form a a defensive line and this was a very important move the um\nThe Marines dig in and I mean this is where through accurate rifle fire they stop in many cases advancing Germans through the weak field\nAnd I mean this is a situation where the the Marines are seeing the French fleet all around them the the army and the French as they move into the area they the the the French say the war is over [noise]\nExcuse me [noise] and and the uh they dig in behind the French and there's you know some famous lines here a retreat hell we just got here is uttered by one of the marine officers who help stop 'em\nAnd there's you know some famous lines here a retreat hell we just got here is uttered by one of the marine officers who help stop I'm part of the German advance\nHeaded out June sex and the Marines are going to go on the offensive against spell out what the Germans now have the superior defensive position everyone in the first war news that the defenders had an advantage because of the machine guns and because of the heavy artillery that was very carefully targeted on the front lines\nThe Marines go forward including\nGovernor research in earnest Jansen into a massacre with becomes a massacre they they advance in a line or through what is called a weak field\nOpen ground and the Germans meld them down but the Marines don't stop\nThey don't stop they keep pushing forward and their objective is a is known as hill one forty two it's a crucial high ground outside of Bella would and they they push on um the forty ninth company in particular is leading the attack a chance then\nAnd I'm George Hamilton who is this a captain of the forty night the the unknowns covers as band of brothers the forty nine through the entire book it's the through line in many cases\nRight this is a moment in an American military history where they were not separating the Marines from the army so they were all blended together into one fighting unit but this particular unit was entirely Marine Corps\nThat's correct and they're moving forward through the wheat and they take the hill\nAgainst all odds the hill was actually occupied by the end of the tally in of Germans but they overcome the hill in\nThere it's a rise from or what does the would look today what it looks like in Nineteen eighty\nIt has similar there's the wheat fields very bucolic but at the same time the scars of war very present there's there's massive show holes that that literally you could swallow a small house with\nThere's a some of the trees are still embedded with the mustard gas shells that had been hurled around during the war first world war\nForty nights overruns one forty two realizes that rise behind this is our position so they fall into one forty two and now comes Johnson's roll the Germans got around behind one forty to how how does it work that he all of a sudden faces more than a dozen German\nState they immediately um fall back into one forty two after they realize that they've gone a little bit too far and they'd brace for counter attack that's typical German tactics within a half an hour the Germans immediately will counterattack position that they just lost in the hope of of regaining it\nAnd that's what came that there are two they're literally potato mash or grenades and artillery that reigned in and the Germans counter attack in great strength\nUm with ... and they started to set up\nThey nearly were over running the hill and Jansen spiders several camouflage helmets which were the ... a German helmets and ... that were represented by a German machine gun or is that we're setting up their their maxims\nAnd have they been able to set up they would have probably over on the hill with a ... fire but chance and saw them and immediately sprung into action and literally let a band that charge by himself and disrupted the these maxim machine guns he was wounded in the process\nAnother body there and we need to mention quickly there is a ... a man by the name of del who's field artillery color sergeant James del us you know as army field artillery he was decorated ... sauce for some months later now it's middle of July Nineteen Eighteen\nHe fires the French artillery piece the Seventy five\nA and this battle ... sauce was also that they call it the second battle of Martin I Believe there was also a nightmare of casualties for their back\nAgain they would the Americans after advance across to open fields they face a heavy machine gun fire but they're going on the counter offensive and they're literally on hinge ing or the Germans salient that had been created\nIn in July or I mean is already in June in may when they were trusting towards Paris and this forces the Germans to fall back to their their initial positions of the hidden Burke line which are these prepare defenses\nDell's and his unit are decorate it decorated for constantly being at risk field artillery pieces don't have a big range so they're ... they're within the range of the big German God\nThis is you know I mean a hidden part of World War one history I think the field artillery is really overlooked in ignored these guys actually you know move forward to some degree with the infantry so they could provide close air support that's why it's called field artillery\nWe will continue the story of the unknown as the untold story of America's unknown soldiers and the ... brought him home Patrick O'Donnell is the author I'm

know it's all so I mean it shows I mean in a way it's sort of parallels the insensitivity of\nYou know to that kind of offices you know in the ... towards the soldiers and the rank and file so I mean it shows a showing the same sort of Iraq cool attitude she know existed\nBetween the sort of women on in the hospitals and the nurses as as existed on the front\nWill include will Catherine the great

the Americans the Americans fall in love with them I think at one point the married men or are the ... the two of the time having a great time\nAnd that was a great shortage of women as a great shortage of men as women\nDo their own they're all proposing to them and we know the company is going to move on and in fact that's the that ends this piece as they march away um but there is a story within this is the stream Lee fat and will cause the cancer is good do include it\nThe way it goes is that the curates daughter falls in love with a very an officer\nWho comes back wounded from the front and there's been meeting near a German graveyard this is a disgrace for the town the girl knows that that if it's revealed she'll be banished\nAnd so one day she gets a hold of a pistol andme kills herself in front of the officer before his age can spring to defense\nThe officer picks up the pistol and kills himself it's a terrible story\nWhen I read it but I realized what will it was telling us is that this war damaged every body forever I mean ... of a family was destroyed a of a Romeo and Juliet destroy themselves and the American show up and there's nothing they can do about it they can't save anybody\n[noise] so so I mean what I found very sensitive you know a good is that she also shows that the French blaming the French women in the village you know ten the grave of
