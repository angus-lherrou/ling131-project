leery\nO'Connor's you know we have three to Washington Mall leave him a hell of a Washington comes to talk of them actually mentioned\nShow so Democrats tried to say that judge Kavanaugh shouldn't be on the Supreme Court first because he was a texture less then because he was an alleged rapist then because there's an alleged gang rape is I mean is he from either to do back in college then because he got angry when you will ledge that he committed rape\nWell that that is their latest ... one of the people pushing that stories John Paul Stevens a former Supreme Court justice thank God for the former\nAnd he said that Brett Kavanaugh's performance during Senate confirmation hearing suggested that he lacks the temperament for the job\nAnd here's what he here's what he said that at the time I bought cabinet had the qualifications for the Supreme Court shouldn't be selected I've changed my views for reasons that have no relationship to his intellectual ability I feel his performance in the hearing\nUltimately changed my mind he said that there's ... to the criticism that he has political biased but I think there's a lot this morning with the the last ten Brett Kavanaugh cried Brett Kavanaugh got emotional and Brett Kavanaugh was part of it and I saw that today it doesn't matter even than it was ... and it matters that he was part of it because he said the Democrats were out to get him\nOr alternatively Brett Kavanaugh was saying something that isn't politically crew that Democrats were out to get them remember the original opposition Brett Kavanaugh and then he was attached to it and it became he was a gang rape is let's say that you had spent the last forty years of your life in public service and\nSomebody you never knew came forward with an allegation against you accusing him of gang rape and the people who oppose you politically the same people who said that they oppose you because you're a texture was then came forward and said we think that you are also a gang rape is Mike and say wait a second this feels like a partisan hit job\nMight you say that or does that make it to park and it's amazing it really is amazing all these folks who say judicial temperament first of all these folks who've never met a judge and there are lots of judges who are angry there are lots of judges who have personality issues like this idea that all judges are sort of\nSt ... on the hill dispense justice from beneath the palm tree it's just not true it's just not true but the question of judicial temperament\nIs how do you approach cases when you're on the bench so we have twelve years of ... fourteen years ago a of Brett Kavanaugh on the federal bench twelve years twelve years a wreck happened on the federal bench no indicator that there was any problem with his judicial temperament he was a moderate to moderate conservative on the bench\nThen he went through a full Senate hearing you remember that there was a ... than a hearing before this\nWhole garbage news cycle but yeah there's a whole set of Senate hearings where he went through silly questions from senators and you had the grandstanding by Kamala Harris and Corey potato head Booker and they went through the entire hearing and she was ... he wouldn't do that was the lip on him he was to do it was too robotic\nAnd then he was twelve years on the bench blasted a full hearing poised plastic\nAnd then shockingly people accused him of gang rape and he got a little mad and it was oh my God how he met look at that that's that's a failure of judicial temperament it turns out that people react differently to different stimuli if you give me a massage that has a different thing when you walk in the in the back of the head with a two by four I react slightly differently\nIf he massage me and you are with Susan I can send your touch and I'm probably going to be placid unhappy if however you clocked me in the back of the head with a two by four I might be justifiably angry and I might be you know mixed enough to turn around and ... o'clock it back in the face\nThat's what happened to have enough but apparently that's no good showing who have not really as he wrote a piece for the ...\nMiffed enough to turn around and ... o'clock it back in the face that's what happened to write cabin up but apparently that's no good showing who have not really it he wrote a piece for the wall Street Journal trying to defend his behavior and apologizing for being pillow show I like that at the time he goes no apology to anyone on any of that\nIf I'd been Brett Kavanaugh and people that it gives me of that I Would have gone into that room and I said let me be clear I Want this right into the congressional record I'm willing to state I just felt this correctly\nPray to God that tomorrow the Republicans do the right thing I'm Talking to you Susan Collins I'm Talking to you Jeff Flake\nLisa Murkowski it's too late for it so cast has now taken over the Senate buildings they've already set up barricades outside the outside the Senate\nBecause of protesters that are expected tomorrow I Will not something it is pretty amazing it's pretty amazing that we have reached this point in American public life with regard to Supreme Court seat this did in fact start with democratic left but decided that the court was a tool for the propagation of public policy and not merely an impartial arbiter of constitutional meaning\nThe reason that the stakes are so high is because the court became something it never was before during the war in Iraq and afterward and that was an actual political institution dedicated to a specific set of policy goals\nThe reason people care about the Supreme Court the reason that the people think that the Supreme Court matters is because of things like roe v Wade when the court decided that it was going to make national policy on the basis of left wing viewpoint having nothing to with the constitution\nAnd the left believe that the court was going to be its final bastion of weapons and no matter what happened they can always count on the court to step in and defend left U.S policy priorities\nFor a long time that was basically correct and now it turns out that when Republicans want to restore the judiciary to its proper role namely reading the constitution as it is written as it was men than the left as well hold on one second hold on a second that's why people are so passionate because let's face it nobody cares about the local dog catcher is race\nNone of those would have happened if we're talking about a branch of government like a bureaucratic branch of government nobody would've caring about that\nThey care about the Supreme Court because they think the Supreme Court is important the only people the only reason people think the Supreme Court is important is because the left has turned it into a political tool and his use it as a club to ... ... people who actually believe in the text of the constitution\nFor the last six the odd years fifty odd years it's Thursday fifty odd years\nIsn't the Nineteen sixties since maybe Griswold versus Connecticut although you can certainly the case of like ... and the court has outstripped its boundaries many times before that obviously Dred Scott ...\nYeah I I wrote my entire Harvard law school third year paper on the idea of the judicial review should be significantly curtail because the founders never intended for the Supreme Court in these superior political branch and yet that's exactly what's happened in\nAny case the passions were running high yesterday and today the Marco Rubio was talking about Brett Kavanaugh Supreme Court nomination in the halls of the Senate or the Senate Hart building and he was drowned out immediately by protesters 'cause this is the way our politics goes now\nWe don't want to go vote\nOkay and that's just the ... I mean that was a normal day for the center of had to be escorted in my belief I Will not something remember that time when people said that the right wing was really crazy and really radical remember the Tea Party and twenty ten how dangerous threat when was you know they never acquired police presence to escort members of Congress to and from things\nThat actually require that and\nBe Frank about this I don't recall a Republican staffer trying to ... members of Congress and released their children's health records which is a thing that actually happened and intern representative Sheila Jackson Lee tried to reveal senators children's health information that's what he allegedly threatened\nAnd that would be Jackson Cosco twenty seven\nWho works for Sheila Jackson Lee\nAnd protesters didn't stop of course and Marco Rubio there was a protest operating Joe Manchin of West Virginia they're just trying to do the same thing they did a Senator Flake button whole somebody in an elevator and then yell at them about how they obviously have women because they believe in due process yeah Ben Sasse was was kind of written up and down by the right the other day for a speech that he gave\nOn the floor of the Senate and that's because people were taking one line kind of out of context when he said he would have preferred Amy Coney Barrett so what I write my original was Amy Coney Barrett if you recall\nBut the bottom line is it been staff is voting for cabinet what the point that he made is this false dichotomy that's being drawn by the left particularly between this case in the me too movement\nIn which they say that if you support right cabinet and therefore hate me too if you support Brett Kavanaugh is due process and presumption of innocence therefore you don't take women seriously he said that's garbage and it's nonsense and he's exactly right of course that's exactly right\nSo surely have what has been playing this anyway and just one second but first let's talk about whether you're sleeping enough probably not maybe the reason and not sleeping in office because your mattress isn't that great I Know you've got that expensive mattress out there at the mall but it probably isn't as good as a mattress thing you can get from he lives\nLee not maybe the reason you're not sleeping enough is cause your mattress isn't that great I Know you've got that expensive mattress out there at the mall but\nIt probably isn't as good as a mattress thing you can get from he looks like why because he would sleep personalized as your mattress able to sleep and takes two minutes to complete they use the answers to match your body type and sleep preference as to the perfect mattress\nWhat are your side sleeper or hot sleeper whether you like a pleasure from bed was he was no longer get to know more confusion just go to sleep dot com slash a bureau take that to me to sleep with him asked you to a mattress and then they send it to you\nAnd your and rapid inflation in front of you you toss it on the bed frame you're going to go\nMy wife and I have ... we love it I bought one from my sister for her wedding is that good for couples\nHe looks can even split the mattress down the middle providing individuals support needs and your preferences for each side they've been ten year warranty you get to try it out for a hundred ... you're not losing anything right now he was offering up to a hundred and twenty five bucks off all mattress orders again\nA hundred and twenty five bucks off and he'll eat sleep dot com slash bureau that she would sleep dot com slash girl for a hundred and twenty five bucks off your mattress or he would flee dot com slash Shapiro\nAll righty so these protesters are not stopping their rating people like Joe Manchin trying button whole people and we'll see if the protesters have there is I heard impacts tomorrow because this is a razor thin margin remember\nIt was eight fifty one forty nine vote that fifty one included Democrat Joe Manchin Republican heavy to vote cushion here\nIf Joe mansion were switches vote if Susan Collins we're joined Lisa Murkowski there is no justice Brett Kavanaugh he goes down to failure\nAnd it's a disaster for Republicans in midterms because a lot of voters just state of their own party you know what you guys are awful go screw off just leap we're not interested in you anymore but this is the protesters burned story\nIs worth noting you know there there was a lot of them today because President Trump tweeted out that some of these protesters are being paid that is undoubtedly true there are a lot of these protesters who are members of groups that actually will pay you to be out there for the day\nSure many of them are spontaneous it's not all of them I it is for the one of the women button hold Jeff Flake in an elevator is an actual democratic operative I mean this person works for a five oh one C. three Center for American democracy I Believe and that center is funded by George Soros ... people are saying oh well ...\nWhat's that used George Soros like stand in for all human evil that George Soros is the guy who I really just rude and a lot of ways I don't think he's a good guy per se I think it's good for a lot of bad things but\nYou don't have to use George Soros says the bogeyman ... but there are a lot of leftist protestors out there who had the launch paid for them by groups that are trying to astro turf that yeah that I think is eminently groups there was a protester I don't know about this protester Memphis protesters genuine rating Joe mansion [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYour job killer how he's\nGoing to vote and of course when he shouldn't say is I'm happy to listen to your stories of survivor also do you have ... evidence\nThey it's amazing I there was an article in your car today or yesterday saying that rate does not require cooperation because most crimes don't require cooperation what the legal standard means by that is that if I were to allege that I witnessed ...\nThere's a second witness that has to corroborate my story however you do need other evidence if I just say I wouldn't have to work I Walk into a police station I say\nSomeone in this room is very room killed someone\nRight let's say that I won't name names but\nI if I if I were to walk into a police station and say that the police would say okay it's our body is there a weapon you have any evidence of this is someone dead is someone listening in equal Robert ... but didn't evidence and you don't need to be a second person in the room for rape to watch it and then tell you yeah it was right\nThere has to be some sort of corroborate of evidence which is why there's so many cases the police simply does not take up because there is no corroborating evidence I ... and has a a terrific\nVideo today about the number of cases of of sexual assault and rape that are either falsely reporter and missed remembered is not to presented is somewhere between eight and four percent it depends on the metrics that you're using\nIn any case the the protesters also took over the Senate Hart building and uh you know hundreds of them taking over the very floors in the building I'm not sure why this is allowed frankly it seems like kind of a dangerous thing but there it was yesterday [noise]\nNow I Will say that all of this is is driving the most Republican unity I've ever seen my lifetime there's new polls out that are just astonishing 'cause there was a poll about Republican female enthusiasm\nThere was a gap in Republican female enthusiasm and what it shows is that the Democratic enthusiasm gap which was at a massive high in July there was a ten ... ten point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans signaled number elections were very important\nAfter Kavanaugh it's down to a statistical tie\nIn July there was a ten ... ten point gap between the number of Democrats and Republicans saying that all of them are elections were very important after Kavanaugh\nIt down with what's called high eight ten point advantage for Democrats ... evaporating evaporated over two weeks if not just a bunch of animated Republican women are not happy with it the great lies that women all women hate\n... judge Kavanaugh and think that no corroborate evidence necessary look at the look at this Quinnipiac ballot is the generic ballot among white when you live twenty second day plus fourteen among white women September night me plus five September thirtieth ... plus one\nHere's a different Scott but but this was a person running for a lifetime running but being considered a lifetime position the fact is\nThis is Washington this was politics for political candidates have been accused of horrible things for years and it becomes very really outraged bond how do you respond to that ... ... and trust me I'm not taking issue which we will never heard of ... question\nOkay what is your how politics works according to CNN report ... wonder why they can't trust me to do that but we'll be back here next week\nWith all of the latest when we have a new Supreme Court justice welcome more will judge Kavanaugh\nRinse

immediately after Republican Susan Collins delivered a lengthy speech on the Senate floor where she said she would vote to confirm Kavanaugh the Collins announcement gave the nominee enough votes for confirmation and gave senator mansion a certain degree of comfort that he would not be the one who would cast the deciding vote\nWith Maine Republican Susan Collins supporting Kavanaugh's confirmation Susan Rice was President Obama's national security advisor created quite a stir\nRice tweeted me when another former Obama official asked who would challenge Pollan's in twenty twenty meanwhile Sarah

of high percentage glide vehicles can we defeat that now ... do we are we preparing to defeat what the Chinese can offer from their bastion sees\nRight so when it comes to heart started weapons especially these types the goose ... they're not like a ballistic missile that is pretty much out of ballistic trajectory we can track it and potentially engage with another missile\nUm these are very hard to defend against and DARPA has launched a ship just a couple of weeks ago we recorded on it called the glide breaker program\nAnd that is a good built an ecosystem or at least examine and understand what ecosystem is needed to create good defensive measures against high profile weapons\nSoviet missile bats right that's a huge multibillion bar you're ill\nNow we're gonna have to ... defense which will share some of those assets but rarely if its own thing and yeah when it comes to ...\nThe whole idea is that they need to push us out you know a couple of thousand miles of their shores and barrage our bases that are existing in that area there within that bubble ballistic missiles meaning that we cannot strike and it will have a tough time\nMaking access inroads toward the mainland China needed towards like you say that the first silent shame so their strategy is multi full but it's also very clear it's a very clear\nAnd we're finally once again coming to terms with this and ... and we have to invest that we want to have gone back to ... billion ... feet are under those circumstances we need to invest not just in these high end capabilities these high end weapons ourselves but then defenses against\nDefenses against the hypocenter glide vehicles yes writers and right now just as a twenty Eighteen we have less than a minute tie your opinion is the U.S navy a capable of striking China before these missiles can fire\nHe'll even how is now it's super high threat scenario just with their anti ship was the missiles so at at another wave submarine warfare and

highlight the contrast between the way the Chinese government\nTakes a whole of government and kind of whole economy response to ambitious technological goals and realizing them with big investments and things like a quantum computing and and artificial intelligence and those big investments also come with big vision statements that they're able to tie different aspects of\nThe country together in to meet the commercial sector that the government to beg you know has a primary influence over there's also the military et cetera so I'm One of the things that he's suggesting bound and suggesting is that or maybe it's time for the United states to\nBegin to match from a government funding perspective some of this research and development that we see coming out of China and also maybe to develop some of its own big vision statements its own Manhattan projects\nA towards some of these areas hyper sonics we are investing more hyper sonics but it's a it's been an effort in fits and starts and and the Chinese are surging very quickly to a head in some key areas or artificial intelligence and we are standing up by the Pentagon is sending a ... a new\nCenter for artificial intelligence research but that's military specific and we can bring in a commercial entities that also have their uses out of that and when you signed up to meet those names you're going to have more success and a few other areas and he also it was it was actually sort of interesting uh even though\nYou know uh it's it's now the Trump beer he actually a structure very on Trump Ian chord are talking about how uh\nThe most recent round of tax cuts is probably not going to be in line with a stepping up to meet those new challenges because it increases the deficit which makes a more consistent funding for those new research and development priorities a little bit harder especially as you go forward and future budget so\nHe wants are in the money he wanted now he doesn't want it in the future he wants it right away even though the defense department is now lose again because of the budgeting DIA ... things at once more and in addition the controversy over remark that he makes and I agree with him immigration how does it work for and what does he want to fight\nA and this is also a something that\nRight now you see a big a sort of pitched battle happening within the executive branch and and really across government where you have a\nYou know within the executive branch voices like Stephen Miller that are looking to curb a not not only to deport undocumented immigrants by the hundreds of thousands but also to curb the amount of legal immigration that can take place and browns point as a you know if this economy ah works great and\nIt it serves the national security purpose when it becomes a magnet for a smart scholars and students from around the world to come to study\nAnd most importantly than to stay and start businesses here that's actually a big\nPart of why we're competitive against a\nPeer competitors like Russia or China because we have an attractive place that only to come and study but also potentially to start to make money and to really tie into the system so the one of the best things that he advocates that the country as a whole and again it's not actually\nGeared entirely towards the defense department it's really a holistic look at you know how to begin this competition\nOne of the things he suggests as making it easier for folks to come to study it and and to stay or if they're these you know folks were especially working in these in these technological fields so that they can uh you know tied into the system and contribute a solutions to\nThis that that the H ... visas that silicon valley's talked

the local boy what the heck is going on Ken ... first of all what is the local void and why is it suddenly an issue why did this come up good evening to you\nWell did he think John I must say I think even most professional astronomers have never heard of the local boy before so it's really nice for the sky and telescope to put a story about a local Lloyd on its\nCover and the local void is this enormous region of nearly empty space that can take almost no Gallup that starts on our doorstep about four million light years away which is not very far and that stretches for a quarter billion light years\nVirtually no galaxies in it that we have now since the Nineteen seventies set up the large scale structure of the universe contains Lloyd they also fill it lets glowing full and that's where most of the galaxies reside in theory explains is perfectly well because in an expanding universe which\nWas which started off thirteenth ... billion years ago some regions of the universe were

about the astronomy this is ... he's the author of the alchemy of the haven't searching for meaning of the Milky Way can I follow your reporting this is a James people's Princeton University\nHe ... he ... he reports to you from the point of view of a cosmologist\nThe enigma is how few stars there are in this boy are there are speculation as to why that happened do we have theories\n[noise] well the question is are there in fact additional galaxies in the local boy that we don't know about and the answer is we don't but no one knows the answer that but perhaps amateur astronomers based apply that answer\nLet me explain the problem that the local void maybe present that now as I mentioned earlier as the universe expand she'd do expect that the under dense region started going to get more and more under dead and so the void are perfectly compatible with standard cosmology and theory predicts\nThat a void should have about ten percent for me in the city of the universe\nBut in fact when we look at the galaxies that we know of and the local boy\nCalculate what is their number relative to the beam in the universe it's only about one percent so there's a factor of ten shortfall in the local boy\nAnd that leads to the question well where are the galaxies and where are the stars is it possible that there are galaxies in the local boy that we don't know about and the answer is a definite maybe and it's here with that amateur astronomers working at very dark site very far from city lights armed\nWith good telescope could perhaps discovered a new Gallup peace in the local vote\nSimply because the nearest parts of the local Boyd are fairly nearby so there's a potential here for astronomers especially amateur astronomers to make discoveries that would help cosmologist reconcile theory without ... on the other hand there are other people\nWho say well this problem actually isn't that much of a problem because\nIn a boy you expect\nThat the material\nMay not have been able to create starts so that in other words the matter is still there you still have this ten percent mattered that the of the universe and avoid any including the local boy but it just hasn't been able to convert itself into stars and felt that the reason we do the\nGalaxy so you might have a very dark galaxies out there that consists basically of dark matter and maybe a little bit of gas but no start so the reason we haven't discovered those galaxies has to play because they met no radiation\nSo right now it's a it's a mystery it's a question that we we do not know the answer we do not know if there are more galaxies to Fifteen here by the local boy or whether the local boy does actually pose a problem for standard consolidate\nKen how would how recent is this discovery of the local void and the local sheet and the questions that you just ... about where are all the stars is this something that's been going on for Twenty years Thirty years how how recent\nRecent little local boy was discovered by Britain totally\nAnd Richard Fisher in Nineteen eighty seven they they were measuring dismissive of nearby galaxies which used to be a much more difficult thing\nThat is today with you know the very large telescopes we have today and it you know you can measure distances quite easily today but back then it was a struggle you had to do each galaxy individually\nAnd they published and that was in Nineteen eighty seven\nAnd a ... totally notice hey there's a whole sector of the sky that basically empty of galaxies and that was the discovery\nOf the local boy back in Nineteen eighty seven so we've known about the local Boyd since then and even before that we knew about other voice in the universe so it's not a surprise in the sense that there is you're given a that the universe is full of\nClusters of super clusters and voice it's not surprising that there is a boy that is the very nearest one and that is simply the local forward\nAs far as the shortfall of galaxies in the local boy\nThat is a a paper that was published in Twenty one by James peoples and that's what that problem which called the voice predominantly\nStarted to be known to astronomers so the the discovery of the local avoid goes back about Thirty years but the the problem with a shortfall of galaxies in the local Floyd is a is it more recent\nProject and you are and your formula of how quickly we're moving is that a new discovery these forces that are compelling us a A R pushing it pushing and pulling us it's six hundred and thirty kilometers per second is that fresh\nThe actual number there goes back many decades but the explanation\nAs part of the local boys are really goes back to a very important paper that appeared about ten years ago twenty oh eight or is lead author was press totally at the University of Hawaii and his team show that to you need the local boy in addition to these galaxy clusters to explain our full motion\nTo the University of now I should say that there are some galaxies known in the local the local void and the two neighbors are about twenty five million light years from earth third floor for regular galaxies they can get the pictures of them in the sky and telescope article and there is surprisingly normal\nYou know despite their very bizarre environment that they're rather similar to tour for regular galaxies in the local group\nSo that message seems to be that even if you live in a\nA void you can be a fairly normal gal\nAre they moving towards us are we gathering the men\nYes yes and in fact a yes vote the local avoided basically trying to eat these galaxies or another way to look at it is the galaxies in the local sheets are gravitational pull is oh I'm\nPulling with other than toward us so that yes they are fleeing the local void and if we could wait a few billion years\nIt's entirely possible there'll be part of the local sheet or at least much closer to it than they are now but in terms of your forming stars they're having no problem making new stars they've got gas\nWhich is the raw material for making the stars and so they seem to resemble fairly well look out but as you say they are indeed fleeing the

even if this isn't real\nI think it does show us what will likely find in the future which will be nothing like we expect\nNow I just got married or not the goblet what is it oh well\nThis is a little bit more real or at least it's a more solid or data or a reader so Sean is use it doing surveys of the\nOuter solar system to try to see if they can locate an additional planet I'm doing that they discovered an extremely distant object they think it's about two hundred miles in diameter let's Albany in the sun\nThat's all but in the sun from six billion to two hundred and Thirteen million miles that's how distant it's all that is its closest approach is six billion miles which is about the distance of Pluto\nBut it can go out to six hundred to two hundred and Thirteen million miles which puts it out to the cloud which just means dishes may be the first real evidence of an on cloud existence that you know that actually is opening in that distance [noise] um [noise]\nBase extrapolating the three objects we presently no that exists out there in these far distances that scientists extrapolated that that could be as many as two million objects bigger than twenty five miles in diameter out there\nAnd put it mildly there's a lot of uncertainty in that extra Appalachian but unless they found the third they call it a GOP the goblet named Nick named it that because it's so far away it's skating\nBut Bob does this disrupt the search for planet X. or the speculated large body that has just ... the court for bells and perhaps even the inner planets over these last tens of thousands of according\nTo the scientists no in fact they say it's presidents fits the president models that say there's a large body out there um but I haven't found the large body and uh you know you're looking you'd think you'd find the bigger object first right around but they have it so it doesn't prove or disprove anything\nAnd I think that the models and the daddy here is so uncertain anything they say is waiving hands and shouldn't be taken very seriously\nNow a moment to enjoy ourselves there was an article in the wall Street Journal these last days red and by young woman I Know ...\nAnd it turns on papers that are submitted to journals academic journals I Do not know about academic journals I read nature and science that are not academic really their professional magazine\nIt turns out that peer reviewed magazines or being a are publishing article so bizarre and so disconnected from my experience not specialized language but weird interpretations of human behavior\nThan it was possible for three academics or two men and women a woman to submit papers based on complete nonsense get them accepted and published online I guess some of them in magazine form and the question here Bob is\nDoes this connect to all of the peer reviewed magazines or is this just in the social sciences where they're moving around adverse\nI personally think this applies to the entire academic community which in many ways is becoming increasingly bankrupt we've talked about the corruption and the climate field which is hard science but it's so hard anymore\nThat this is poisoning the entire academic community that is not a new story what these academics did these three academics who they were very disturbed by the\nBy the what they call ... tree of a lot of these ethnic\nWoman is a feminist um uh ... what I forgive me gender\nOr ethnic departments and the journals set a publishing academic now just like nature and science and those are not professional those academic journals as well they're reviewed and they were disturbed by the lack of rigor and the science\nSide to get together and they they they created\nTwenty fake papers they sent out they said they could have done a lot more but they had to end this finally got accepted\nSeveral ... pending rewrites we're probably been accepted with time they expected they could have gotten half these fake papers accept it and the subjects of sometimes have ... one of the most absurd absurd one was uh\nUh they fake that they wrote up a paper this talking about how the parks are an example of rape culture that dogs in dog parks getting ...\nThat was just nonsense Bob and it was obvious that was nonsense it's obvious the moment you say it was obvious to everybody you read it in the wall Street Journal and I wish they had to\nAccept this journal they published it and they gave it a lot for a great example of good research in ... in in gender studies\nThey also did a paper in which they read they basically took a chapter from Hitler's bind calm and they reshaped the slightly using feminist jogging and it got published\nThe one I liked about is the one in the fat studies I I thought ... was a stand up it fooled me I I I I'm In fact we could found journals right now that might get accepted you know we'll be right for example a excellent moon colonies we could we could put up a journal like that and probably get papers\n... the thing is you actually being more real their knees or ethnics chin and a feminist\nOr a woman much these days it's not just what is right at home is in ... in the academic community
