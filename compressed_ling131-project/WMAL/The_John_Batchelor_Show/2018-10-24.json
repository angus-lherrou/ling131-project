the way to combat this what is your come up with\nBelieve it or not federalism Hillary Clinton one of the great advocates of federal power of the modern era she has now discovering federalism I got amazing how this works Donald Trump comes along suddenly Hillary Clinton and the left are discovering the states are kind of great\nHere's what she tweeted yesterday it reality of a Supreme Court with the right one majority is it the states are new important front in protecting civil rights especially the right to the most vulnerable among us\nIs that really a new important front in protecting civil rights\nOr does it turn out that the states were always an important front in protecting so right now folks are going to say well think about the fact that said to responsible for ... that's true\nIt was also said that we're responsible for failing to abide by the fugitive slave act and an Eighteen fifty leading to the civil war the federal government was trying to force state in the north to abide by the fugitive slave act say through north refusing to abide by the fugitive slave act\nStates are only as good as the people who comprise them and their policy is only as good as the people comprised them the one thing that is certainly true is that the United states as a mixed\nState and and national system as it is putting federal thirty nine or they mix system state governments are designed to preserve the ... of locality in American Jurisprudence\nAnd the fact that blessed is only now realizing this as soon as somebody who's in office they don't like is the head of the federal government demonstrates just have this honest they are because here's the thing Hillary Clinton and her ... if they ever got in charge again how long do you think they picked by the state's rights proposal how long do you think they'd be in favor of states' rights the answer is five seconds five seconds\nAnd the left is just dishonest about all the stuff that same left that proclaims that Donald Trump is dishonest listens dishonest when Hillary Clinton says she likes states right\nNow what Hillary Clinton mean is that she wants to use any obstacle to prevent President Trump governing actually believe in case right so she actually believes in states where Ike and presumably should want to ... to the states from the federal government across the board including if she'd been president\nWe all know that that was never going to happen will know that was ever going to happen and said the truth as Democrats really want is to copy the policies of Scandinavian countries where people forget to tell you this but the policy and Scandinavian countries is not just the math and social welfare state is a math and social welfare state paid for by enormous\nUnbelievably high taxes\nThe taxes and places like Denmark and Norway fifty to sixty percent on everybody making more than fifty or sixty grand a year\nWe're not talking about taxes on just the wealthy\nEven folks on the left are not willing to be honest about what exactly it would take to pay for all the crap that they are talking about\nInstead what they will do is they will just kick the can down the road so what exactly are they proposing so they're not really proposing federalism and they're not obviously proposing back base legislation the left is proposing spending a lot of money so now we're going to get in the twenty twenty primaries when the Democrats who can spend the most cash so we have Kamala Harris who's proposing giving\nPoor family five hundred bucks based on nothing we really don't know where exactly this money is going to come from how they're going to spur the economy any of that stuff Cory Booker says well why didn't five hundred why not do a hundred times five hundred what good everybody Fifteen grand\nSo why not give me five hundred grand by the way one of five million just helicopter pallets of cash over Newark soldiers\n... pallets of cash I mean hopefully people get out of the way now there'll be crushed by money and die happy that apparently the idea of recording Booker so according to Vioxx which is the repository of all things stupid that's not saying that everybody at boxers do but there's something intelligent pokes a box of all why they remain there is beyond the senator Cory Booker is introducing\nOf all things too but that's not to say that everybody at boxers do but there's something intelligent folks a box of all why they were made there is beyond the senator Cory Booker is introducing a bill aimed at closing the gap between rich and poor is I did get lower income kid a sizable nest egg\nWe're going to selectively quote the Bible you may as well quote the whole thing it's been a hard life for me these last six years but on the whole I felt grateful for the many blessings that have come my way and being friends not least and it's so disappointing then and more than a little embarrassing to learn I'm imaginary a creature no more real than a psych class or have a breath\nAgain\nYou're real human\nYou're not a real woman you know why because you're not genetically it real woman they aren't city or a gender that your gender and feminine that you were a male who had surgery to look more female and that you carry feminine attributes\nThat is accurate that is accurate using language you're just not accurate used language to say the or a female on Sunday news broke that the Trump Administration seeks to narrowly defined gender as an immutable condition determined by genitalia at birth\nWell actually they weren't defining sect that way and\nThen you guys can play section genders they say the same thing I ... I'm reluctant to react to this latest cruelty which is obviously just one or a cynical move clearly designed to stir the pot ahead of the election trans people or the latest conservative whipping girl like African Americans in the Nineteen fifties\nOr gay people in the Nineteen nineties into thousands\nNope nope\nGay people can objectively claim to be attracted to members of the same sex\nThat's a subject and claim there is no way to objectively verify that so that is what it is I can objectively verify your sex for a variety of measures hay and black people white person who claims that they were black person is not in fact a black person is Rachel though was all learn\nI was speaking of the F Scott Fitzgerald festival in Rockville, Maryland this weekend when I first read about the administration's intense\nSince then I've thought about a lot about Nick Caraway and the great Gatsby ah [noise]\nAnd then there's this continues instead the actual world contains all sorts of wonderful variations of nature look there are two ... and puffing there's a ... political is in a blue lobster and the Venus flytrap isn't the miracle that God has given us all these wonderful thing truly if there's room in this world for these there shouldn't be ruined his world for me\nThere again nobody is ingesting that transgender people should be mistreated but you do not get to tell the entire civilization ... to find biological sex on the basis of anti science positions because\nHow you feel on the inside my favorite part of the states it's interesting that science is on the side of this policy there is no science on the side of the policy promulgated by the left that sex does not exist so they started off with such exist but gender is unconnected with tax and then they went to gender exists\nBut it exist on the spectrum and then once you start to exist again but it only exists on the spectrum\nI suspect is that didn't exist for a while now do this again but it only exist on his back when there's a spectrum effects there is no speck of most\nHuman beings are sexually ... okay if you if you want to suggest that there are other species what effects can change fine by you or not you're not a fish or don't want to be ... or your human among human sex does not change that's not the way this works\nBut this has been pushed by the hard left until you get the spectacle of even called bear hunting Trump punting President Trump on this trans issue and how telling is the remark and he's about making pretty telling all all play line and second\n... is thinking about writing new guidelines for treating gender should we defined quote on a biological basis but it's clear grounded in science you care about\n[noise]\nI listen to the crowd cheered that now you shouldn't be happy that they care about science I'm confused he's isn't when it comes to climate change that the Trump Administration is utterly anti scientific when it comes to the EPA they're only anti scientific and that's bad but now they care about science when it comes to biological sex\nAnd that's bad that's even see the hypocrisy and what he's saying himself the answer is no because of the left even scientists malleable now my position on climate change I've made clear multiple times on this program I did like an entire program on it a couple of weeks ago talking about the new IPC report\nThe world is warming it's warming it is lower rate than the scientists that it was going to according to their modeling probably a majority of that warming according to\nEvery scientist I've ever seen including Roy Spencer who is the right favorite climate scientists suggest that the majority of that warming is due to human action that does not dictate global governance of the climate in order to dictate that we have to crush capitalism in spirit or an action\nBut that is considered an anti scientific position by the left is considered a and it is considered I guess that form to mention science when it comes to biological sex so\nIf this was a new democratic position good luck with the guys that law\nSo I'm just a second we'll talk about some other democratic positions and why the news cycle continues to cut in favor of the president of the United states first\nLet's talk about what you do in the bathrooms you get ready to go out every night\nWell I use dollar shave club because I Love the dollar shave club has everything I Need to look feeling smell my best friend even more is the fact I never have to go to a store I mean on me I'm not a big fan of the human and that

gender with regard to the anti science nonsense pushed by the transgender movement is an actual tweet from New York Times science the idea that a person ... is determined by their anatomy at birth is not true and we've known that it's not true for decades well\n... realistically speaking I suppose that's not true and the only in the most only animals narrow sense is determined by chromosomes but it's determined by genetics and theoretically you could have some sort of birth Mao formation\nWhen you were born that leaves you breath and the genitalia match up with your actual genetics so I guess in a very narrow symptoms true but the idea that that means it's sex is on the spectrum among human is just stupid\nI loved his head Leno anatomy does not determine gender experts say right genetics determined gender\nOf the researchers who study gender issues and provided health care to people who do not fit the typical male female pigeon hole the typical male female pigeonholed though they're just created by society\nSaid that the Trump administration's latest plans and find gender goes beyond the limits on scientific knowledge the idea that a person sex is determined by their anatomy at birth is not true and we've known that it is not true for decades as John ... says Josh us safer and endocrinologist\nAnd the executive director of the ... the center for transgender medicine and surgery of course the mount Sinai health system in New York don't talk about a scientific stuff\nAnd you talk about whether they're beneficial effects you transgender surgeries overtime and there is not good evidence to suggest that me and effect over the course of decades is actually significantly spirit and no surgery and yet this has become part of the transgender movement shtick now\nLet me be clear we live in a free country you want to carve up your own genital such a problem or you can find a surgeon is willing to do that for you\nGo for the free country but let's not pretend that the science is on the side of all of the claims that are being made by love is buried down in his article is a genetics does play a role though oh you think\nOh you think so is it by the way you know you know and it's not just going to tell you because they mail order to have his quick and berries physically removed in some sort of act and then he would still be a male and if he intends to do so in a surgery we're not supposed to consider him a female\nOkay that is that is not logical I Want to talk for just a second about the sort of propaganda that's been promoted on on this issue and it really is insane propaganda so\nThe the notion that has pushed by the left that transgender isn't is not a mental disorder is completely a scientific\n... now what the what does that they like to say things like the diagnostic and Statistical Manual because the DSM five suggests that\nGender identity disorder is no longer a mental disorder and said what the DSM five said is it a mental disorder is it called syndrome characterized by clinically significant disturbing in an individual's cognition emotion regulation or behavior that reflects the dysfunction in the psychological biological or developmental process these underlying mental functioning\nNow this is this is the the funny part\nSocially deviant behavior and ... and conflicts that are primarily between the individual and society are not mental disorders unless the devious or conflict results from a dysfunction in the individuals described bumps in other words and something that makes you think that a pink elephant is talking you unless this makes you feel bad this is not actually a mental disorder according to the DSM\nThe definition makes room for it's making quit room for politically correct posturing right if I and having a significant problem ended up myself all I have to do was blame it on society's intolerance and it is no longer consider a mental disorder\nAnd so if you're a suicidal because you're a man who believes he's a woman\nAnd yes I can still find a way to blame it on the side you all you have to say is the reason I'm suicidal is because people are mean to me and society not because I've suffered with this\nTerrible conflict inside my inside my brain for my entire life\nBy now society's fault is how the DSM ... avoids the obvious implication that if you're a man who believes your woman\nYou have a mental disorder ... by the way if you're a fat person who believes or skinny or a skinny person who believes your fat we all have knowledge of mental disorder if you're a skinny person who is your fat it's called the anorexia it's dangerous and it's a mental disorder if you're a person who believes that you do not need a left arm but there's something called body just more for you\nThis is a mental disorder but if you're a man who believes your woman and you don't need a pianist then it's not a mental disorder it's society's fault\nYou explain that one to me\nAnd none of that has anything to do with science and all of it is specifically designed to blame society for what is clearly and obviously a mental disorder the reason that I'm curious about\nAnd that has anything to do with science and all of it is designed to blame society for what is\nClearly and obviously a mental disorder the reason that I'm curious about calling in a mental disorder and the reason I Do so because you can't actually train a mental disorder by blaming it on society if you want to come up with new treatments for mental disorder the wait to hear that it's not by saying that society at large responsible for the discomfort people suffering from the mental disorder\nThere were marching from Honduras escape Honduras why are you coming here with Honduran glad when my ancestors got here they weren't carrying a Russian or lithuanian flat\nAnd they came to the United states ready to carry an American flag debt in the polling\n... this idea that you can simulate all cultures including people force than we do not want to be assimilated\nIn social thinking at the fighting is just not accurate and yet that's what Democrats continue to support to promote or in Honduras by the way in

because we now we come to win it grew into a NATO conflict and that was in twenty sixteen\nBecause of the concerns the fears of Eastern Europe\nThat Russia having gobbled up half of Ukraine was going to turn its attention to the Russian frontier and the NATO troops and the NATO commanders cooperated in this fear Steve because they injected in the idea\nThat Russia was an aggressor and the little green men could be in Lafayette just as easily as\nAs they could be in Poland and since then\nThere's been nothing but escalation in Europe so we started in Ukraine\nWe spread to the area then we spread to Eastern Europe and now Steve because of the exercise that Russia just ran with China in the in the far eastern Siberia we have a true global ... global conflict with Russia and China on one side and the United states and NATO and the other end these five years\nYes and it's amazing to me John not amazing but it striking but as I finished the book how many of the subjects we discussed for five years ago\nHe would say it's history and it is history but it's still front page news today a\nIn Ukraine for example it's still sad what set off the fall of the government there and brought pro American government\nThe power in a country that's part of Russia is common Ukrainian civilization right on the border of Russia where it was the famous snipers you remember that John in February Twenty one\n... fame\nAnd said well actually not I mean newspapers still say that the president of Ukraine at the time you call a true would soon be deposed in fleet of Russia has sent snipers to kill as a point on this on my ... square but all the evidence now in is that\nIt wasn't the code which but his very right wing even neo Nazi enemies who are the snipers now that we're that's important is that those people\nWho sent the snipers neo Nazis have grown into a major force in Ukraine Today and yet we back the government of Ukraine so this is another theme of the book I mean are we

an early journalistic alert system\nThat is I call attention to things that people weren't paying attention to [noise]\nI think that that's one\nThat that's been one important for me I'm doing this broadcast with your weekly [noise] is that you and I have been able to talk about things that are working behind the news that are very important that are going to shake a strict and when I read what we've discussed what I've written up now in the book\nOn clean used in a kind of negative way 'cause I Wish a lot of these things hadn't happened the way what we began to trace in late to

into nuclear conflict I'm John bachelor list is the John ...\nThat wasn't constrained by but China has building the building up at some pace its own intermediate range trees so Trump said we have to leave now [noise]\nWe this obscure something a fundamental importance and we've talked about this than it is in my book a war with Russia or that the United states committed acts of knew of a policy that endangered the INS tree the\nMost formal won the first one was when President Bush\nIn two thousand and two left and all these initials will confused people they confuse me the ab ... treaty that truly had been negotiated in signed in Nineteen Seventy two [laughter] ... ballistic missile treaty and it was absolutely crucial to everybody's secure a B cause it prohibited\nAny country in specifically the United states the Soviet Union and Russia from the pouring missile defense installations\nWhich meant walked let's go back to what was called mad what kept the new therapies ever since the beginning of the atomic age was this doctrine of mutual assured destruction\nThat if one side attack the other\nIn an attempt to destroy it ... itself would be attacked and destroyed\nAnd that really ... but madness could lead to this or in an accident kept either side from protecting itself from a retaliatory strike so when Bush left it he opened the door\nTo a profound revision isn't that eventually undermine this intermediate range tree\nAnd the Russians began when I saw was going on to develop a counter or they began violating the treaty I whether they deploy these missiles or not is open to question but they certainly develop them and they tested I\nEither haven't deployed them so the United states by doing that now\nRemember something else happened\nWhen the United states violated another agreement the one it made with Gorbachev that it would not move NATO eastward toward Russia when NATO began to expand or Russia's borders and today John we all know we're right on Russia's borders NATO is [noise]\nMissile defense installations which we are now being implemented because Bush has left the treaty prohibiting them became a NATO project where NATO went missile defense with some of the results of this\nAnd I'll get to the end of this point but I think it's very important the result is today as we talk Russia is ringed by American NATO missile defense installations [laughter] do you say so watch how does that to relate to what Trump\nAnd it's because the Russians have clay\nAnd America nuclear scientists who are independent such as professor Theodore postal in my case I have agreed that these missile defense installations can fire\nIntermediate range missiles that is there not only defensive installations they are often see [noise] so we've been building their capacity to fire cruise missiles as I recall which have been banned for almost a decade now and the Russians have complained bitterly\nAnd we have not responded so we have a situation was so when the Russians began to respond they probably violated the treaty but they were reacting to us\nAnd and the age of ... we moved on showing the justice system yes actually exactly\nAnd even though the the INS band land base missiles\nThe ages just complicated a lot of them are on ships but they are in fact the land based develop missiles put on those shifts they it's more the distinction between seeing land [noise] oh I think it's fair to say\nAnd you might get on somebody and get somebody on like an ally to John ... who says my narratives not correct but I leave it to be that as his true with the history of the Cold War we have ... or\nYou know within ten in mind [noise] done profoundly unwise things in regard to Russia to which Russia has reacted\nAnd we see what it leads to because of this treaty this act of nuclear abolition has some was symbolically and historically of enormous importance to now may may or may say\nThis treaty this act of nuclear abolition isn't was symbolically and historically enormous importance now maybe it'll be say there are six months to get noticed six months in advance\n... by Trump to get the Russians to do something a Trump ... you're gonna meet where John ...\nEleven in Paris for the for the commemoration of one hundred years since the armistice ended the gun fell silent and November eleventh Nineteen\nAnd maybe they're going to and I think we're supposed to meet again in Argentina November from the sidelines of the G ... if they do meet maybe there's a secret diplomacy under ... eye doesn't look that now I have a quote here from the Institute of us and Canadian studies\nA Sergei Rogoff a home with a Russian has links to Russia he's he is there a guy on America I Know she or he believes that because of the vote here is that leaving the INS could bring the whole structure of arms control crashing down now\nThat that ... that says speculative late but it's been my experience these five years that escalation work this way if something can happen and go wrong it does happen and goes wrong fats escalation\nSo what happens after the ins and is that the start doesn't get extended and that's all that's left there is nothing else after dark\nWell I could not to tell my book again but the\nThesis of the book is that this new Cold War is more dangerous than the proceeding one took during that proceeding Cold War we and the Soviet Union inactive all sorts of measures to keep us safe\nIncluding these nuclear weapons or restrain regulation agreements now they're being dismantled uh so if we have a new nuclear war\nWithout the safeguards that protected is during the\nCold War I didn't mean to say nuclear war we have a new Cold War\nWithout the safeguards that protected us from nuclear war we're in the greatest danger John what's gonna happen now there's politics too so that's going to come into play uh there's going to be political forces in the United states\n... just a moment we're

what has been\nProfiting for many hundreds of thousands of years but right now the fish and Wildlife Service that fat found Fifteen hundred and forty four privately held out ... acres in Louisiana which is kind of next door and they have designated those acres though there are privately held\nHabitat what does that mean what is the power of habitat and Richard I go to the all arguments\nYou preview this by saying Justice Kagan introduced\nThe hypothetical of landowners and the designation of critical habitat and she asked whether I'm just making a slight improvement that's the quote you give a would be adequate Justice Roberts on the other hand\nIt I read this mocking we ask the question can you build a giant greenhouse in plant long leaf pine in Alaska and call that a habitat now both seem to be making fun of fish and Wildlife Service Sarah have I have I misunderstood the sobriety of the court [laughter]\nI mean they're all trying to do is to figure out how something relates to the key statutory term that is the Supreme Court when it took this case was not interested in for his principles there is a statute which says that the fish and Wildlife Service\nCan designate essential critical habitat for ... purposes and the actual disputed in the court was a semantic one is what does it mean to be essential and what Justice Kagan hypothetical was designed to establish\nIs it you can have an essential habitats which is not currently occupied by any members of the species that is in some sense ... done because the statute actually anticipates that then does have procedures for an occupied habitat [laughter] the chief justice coming at this from the other end says this term\nAre essential makeup as some cases but it's not infinitely elastic and certainly would not say that I habitat is going to be essential if you pick some random part of the forest up there in Alaska\nDecide to cover it up with some kind of a dome and then put some pine trees in it and do it you could not designate bad land and the answer that Justice Kagan would give is we want to sound the frog of this particular sort of this area so we are closer to the situation of not being an arbitrary selection\nWhich is true I don't think you could say this was all betray encourages but what it is is is highly remote and so the question then becomes is\nHow essential is essential is the question they're debating and you would never have to debate this question if the issue was put to the fish and Wildlife Service\nIf you want to designate this land is habitat condemn it\nAt which point you can do whatever you want within the clue some of it off\nBut the sweet home case that you refer to ah was bad but\nSaid essentially when the government does engaging in habitat designation\nIs prevent the animals from being harmed by the destruction of habitats and that is something which they can do as of right under the statute which says you're not allowed to take endangered species and in terms of listed there oh you're not allowed to capture not allowed to produce you not allow the hundred not allowed to slaughter of one form or another\nAnd then the issue is whether or not the word home which is kind of defeat who's covered habitat destruction as opposed to something that's not going to sit on that list like poisoning an animal and there was a\nBig argument about it and Justice Stevens said look as far as I'm concerned the government may think it's more efficient the designated a habitat than it is to buy it\nMean about it and Justice Stevens said look as far as I'm concerned the government may think it's more efficient to designate a habitat than it is to buy it and who am I to tell them given the deficit we give to administrative agencies that there is wrong so habitat\nOr preservation is now essentially a regarded as an anti harm measure rather than as a provision\nBut at that mean you know one way or the bond that means the government doesn't even have to deal with the controversy of taking any more you can just designate something like Central Park a habitat and nothing will ever happen to it you don't have\nThe question is do you mean the essential test and it'd be read essential narrowly then they can't succeed because it's not critical because it's not as central to centrally broadly you can do it the takings problem just eliminates that problem because you know you want to take it didn't take it whether it's essential and I figure it out\nDo you have to do you have to compensate if you ... as opposed to how that yes yes you know because the Wildlife Service money if they said take money at\nToday for gains tomorrow what they do when governments typically condemned property for sites they sell part of it off in order to recoup ... right\nYou know because what happened to the Supreme Court works is once a precedent is decided I'm In the course of law which are not allowed to reopen that particular\nPoint so the only thing they could do is to look at a dictionary and similar sources most of them and they use the word essential talking about indispensable viable without which something can't worry going to the core of the essence of things and I would think as a straight linguistic matter a future use of property which is going to require future\nPayments which are not yet made which may never happened could hardly be regarded as essential but Justice Kagan is trying to say look I get these guys deference to them I give these guys that friends they know more about the environment than we do we know they did this extremely careful study which they didn't do\nIt was exactly this study would want to do if you're going to condemn the land the differences\nIf you can buy if a zero as you can with designation you'll take it\nBut if you have to pay thirty four million dollars is not a very likely chance that they would put their money up for that so the takings clause is designed to do is to establish a market as against the government\nAh which will reduce its appetite and as I keep stressing when you teach this or you talk about it\nIs the greatest importance of the takings clause is not that it gives compensation when property has taken which is nice that we really important thing is you put a price up there and all of a sudden something had brain scans of some dubious games are not worth the price that you have to have\nSo you don't do it there was a famous case all Lucas and which the government designated certain land\nHum as being essential to keep it empty even though it was worth five hundred thousand dollars\nAnd Justice Scalia wrote an opinion saying if you designate this so it can't be used for anything it's a taking what the government was required to do was to buy the land pay Mr Lucas five hundred thousand dollars now and it's titled the land which cost at five hundred thousand dollars and what do you think they promptly did they sold it\nBecause it wasn't worth five hundred thousand dollars to\nA neighbor offered them to pay three hundred and fifty thousand dollars I said what am I going to get the rest of the money for this so essentially what they did is they put it up to auction and that's what it is if you actually have to take possession of the property you don't want that\nWhat you do as you say I'm a better off selling off this thing and taking the money and using it for real habitat preservation or doing preservation or do I want to keep this you had Richard\nYou introduce the possibility of wiggle room here when the court decides this it turns on the word essential how can they fish and Wildlife Service make a rational argument that inventing something in Louisiana that might in fifty years satisfy the decay go for broad is the central habitat how do they make that\nThe argument they make is there money multiple reasons to return and sense as far as that concern means appropriate for conducive to\nEditors minutes straight it has the first right to interpret the statute so this gets back to the famous Chevron doctorate and if you regard the term is ambiguous to give a nod to the agency I Do not regard this term is ambiguous but with essentially happens is the liberal wing\nOf the court is much more willing to regard terms is ambiguous and the conservative turn\nJustice Kavanaugh was not present on the bench when this case was argued so it's quite possible to go for for which point that would be argued and I think one of the things that's likely to happen as you get a consistent intellectually conservative majority\nIs that they're going to be less willing to sort of find ambiguities which allow administrators the discretion I think this is a pretty good case I have never seen the word\nEssentially used it in a way in which it was used by the court below which says that doesn't matter when it doesn't matter how it doesn't matter how much it costs it's essential that the government thinks that it's essential and so the statutory constrained does read out and I don't think that this particular\nCourt will tolerate this how it is that the four liberal judges will go I don't know nobody quite knows the basic opinion after the ... the oral argument to places that it can go any which way how who indeed be really\nBecause those are the basic opinion laughter the we oral arguments are places that it can go any which way\nThey how who indeed be really young kid go for frog can jump any which way Richard abstain we will return to the west point and kept the decision in the spring Richard Epstein of the Hoover Institution of the dust he'd go for a frog formerly of Mississippi I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nThey're still not doing any science observations it's clear that the engineers up being very careful with this computer and maybe they're having still issues with it and so that proceeding cautiously which has got to wait to see what happens job\nOpportunity yeah the storm has weakened any indication of opportunity\nTo all pretty much gone at this point but there's no ... listening on a regular basis we're still not into the dust storms seasonal November and their theory is that uh the even though they they they can communicate with the rover the rover has\nIt's probably got ... pounds cup of dust from the storm\nAnd therefore can't get enough power and need is a dust devils to clean it off and the dust devils season doesn't start until November and so we were really waiting that's the way they're gonna keep listening but then they're not expecting anything to significantly change or until at least know\nTimeline that runs out an opportunity we can and you are\nJanuary that's what they said that they might listen a little longer than that but they basically they they think that if they haven't heard anything by January means that that that they they never it was never able to get enough power to come back to life and so\nI wouldn't completely dismiss the possibility because at any time if a dust devils finally arrives and clear is off the rover might send a signal back\nBut at the moment that's going to be that's the deadline that looking at they will stop looking very hard after January\n... to no problems with the main space crap but they're looking for a landing site what's the status Bob\nWhat is the deal is if they found a full survey or are you grew and it's a very it's above the surface they had hoped to see a flat spot about Fifteen meters a hundred and fifty feet across and they and they've only found one place that's about twenty meters sixty feet across\nAnd the problem is that the ... the space craft doesn't really have the capability precision capability they plan to have the capability of hitting such a small spot and the only place they can land\nAnd so they had decided to do the lay the landing till January what they did in October and they've done at least one or Herschel they have not yet on the second ... Herschel but they're they're going to do her tour whistles in October they've done one and then the sun moves between us and higher boost her in November and December\nWe moved to a success for a cube is that what is the cube that Bob and what's the success\nRight well that's a tiny a standardized a square satellites you can hold one in the palm of your hand I think they're\nLike a\nFour centimeters across to sense to me to them and this is a matrix metric so I'm not that good with it but you can hold them in the palm of your hand they designed initially for students to teach students how to make a satellites but they ... they have the technology has gotten sophisticated enough that you can even see Cuba's launched for all kinds of real purpose is not just\nTeaching and so when they launched the insight Mars lander earlier this year to ... to Mars um they also launched waited to secondary cube SATs called Marco\nOr there's two of them ... want to go to and these cube SATs all basically do a\nFlyby of Mars and they're going to be used kind of as a communication ... satellite wall and such insight is going down to land but they're also a technology experiment to see if cube SATs can be used to interplanetary missions and here's the success\nOne of the ... kids ... this week excessively took the first interplanetary texture by huge that and they got a picture of laws\nNow it's not as spectacular image laws just looks like a little red dot but was key about this was they were able to point this cube set accurately they been able to have it has solar panels to maintain power it's in interplanetary space that's\nUnusual and so this is telling us that we're gonna sock shifting I think in interplanetary travel from a\nA big expensive and rarely launch space craft liking set insight\nAnd light curiosity to small very inexpensive cube SATs that you can launch frequently and in large numbers to do a lot of different things\nAnd so this is a this is a groundbreaking or a technological success jobs\nAnd keep that because they're cheap Bob that means that interplanetary study can be done by private institutions private individual\nAnd keep that because they're cheap Bob that means that interplanetary study can be done by private institutions private individual there were no longer depending upon big space to deliver a good science\nYes it's very possible and I think we're going to talk about this later on in the second segment but it's but now that would be very possible for private companies to build small cube SATs at a reasonable cost and sell them at fault interplanetary travel and send sell that capability to college countries scientists you know the whole world\nA research scientist with say a good plot for the discovery at the end of the world now we go to another success\nAnd this is the launch of a mercury mission we've had very few mercury mission the last one I remember a gave us the possibility of water rights at the polls because it's perpetually blocked by the ... what does this mission\nWell the the first mission was messed that first mission was America I think ... that flew by mercury and the second one was American a mission messenger that altered mercury that's the one\nThat's found as you said John possible uh actually dark craters that might have water in them um this mission is a joint Japanese European missions it's called the ... the whole mission is called ... Colombo in honor of an attack at the two Italian\nI'm a famous scientist and explore um but the mission is actually two different orbiters around mercury that Japan or but it is going to be studying the magnetosphere of mercury and the European or butter is going to be looking at the planet itself\nAnd they'll be carried together on a transport module um\nAnd it can have slightly different orbits so they'll see different things when they're there\nAnd they're going to take seven years to get there it was launched by an area on five rocket ah this past weekend successfully and so in seven years they've got to both move into all that about mercury and look at it that much but look at it\nOh this cool Bob they're going to fly by the earth and twenty twenty fly by Venus and twenty twenty and do Venus again and twenty Twenty one so they're using that gravity effect right they like how escort\nYes in fact getting to mark here is not easy and it's and so they and this is much like the ... probe getting into the son in law which is not necessarily easy and so using the slingshot flyby met that this is something that scientists tip\nThat engineers have really developed a very sophisticated mad at the last decade or so to do go almost anywhere and this also allows you to do it with smaller rockets because you don't need as much energy um when you launch you take get that energy from the

... except him and accepted him and\nTook him in and ended up you know treating him like a son and my grandfather stayed with a shack\nAnd what resonates with me is just this this shake ignored the

to me that was one of the most important parts of the story I had\nTo close the circle you return there are two thousand seven and again in two thousand and died and you were ... they they make a meal

your fingers\nAnd they they show you a plate and what is the significance of that play\nSo they you know I found them and it was just incredible one of us incredible moments in my life and and then they told me that um the Potter we're eating on was um that that my grandfather would have eaten off that Potter ... class\nThat they kept it it was one of their prized possessions in the in the

you\nKnow what I mean you never know when you might need it and besides the plate is good for Ninety One years if you care for it\nYeah yeah there was this beautiful big plot er and um and and it was

know it's after we found them they had thought that I was in\nI'm One of the the things that I remember the most is that when they had heard that I was coming there it was after we found them they had

correct\nAnd most of them out so yeah that's a war zone a hundred years later now your\nGrandfather a comes a time when the raiders or in the area and the shake rides off this is his chance to escape but you've never very escape very law when you're in the first World War\nHe caught he's the president can can scripted he becomes part of the work battalion for the Turkish military they transporting nice they transport him west he's made a slave again\nHe survives your grandfather is the dirtiest human beings have you've got his genes you'll live forever dawn\n[laughter] I I I I miss\nOut of him he was he's incredible and one of the things that I think he picked up and his story to me is that you know even if he goes through all of that his his he had incredible courage and and\nAnd he his story is so inspiring to me because he just he just keeps his his will and his faith that he's going to get home one day\nTo see his family at that point really going to get back to his family\nYes
