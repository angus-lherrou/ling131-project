that we're not going to allow the Democrats filibustered the cabinet nominee and that means that by Saturday the full Senate will be voting on Brett Kavanaugh was Mitch McConnell yesterday announcing that he was going to file cloture on the floor of the Senate survey\nPlenty of time for members to review and be briefed\nOn the supplemental material before friday cloture vote so I'm following\nCloture on George ... this evening\nSo the process can move forward as I indicated earlier\nAnd the process should move forward the process should move forward because guess what shocker it turned out\nThat nothing has been found and we've been doing this for another week another week thing that Senator Jeff flake and the idea of the FBI investigation was going to tell everyone here is clearly that's happened clearly Democrats are now very satisfied but how do you go on everybody has a lot of faith in the FBI hooked on the left\nIt really feels like a full investigation has been done and they're feeling pretty satisfied about all the take for example Senator Dianne Feinstein who took the results of the FBI inquiry and she saw that basically said nothing new and it's and you know what I feel like it's been federal I guess now really consider Brett Kavanaugh's nomination or alternatively she did what everyone knew what she would do and she said\nOh no investigation is a bunch of ... and it was never meant to be comprehensive and therefore Democrats can't vote for Kavanaugh on that basis Arizona and find science who really has just been\nI mean there's no other word for it in terms of the process and she was engaged in an evil I mean it really has been an evil process in which she then gauge getting an allegation on July thirtieth holding it for six weeks until just before the vote releasing it without any corroborating detail\nMay be releasing anonymous link in order to spur the full release of the story and then really bright cab non suppose a gang rape\nAnd all of this than growth but here Senator Dianne Feinstein continuing her pattern of being ... by saying that the FBI investigation is incomplete and becomes incomplete therefore that's really why we shouldn't vote on Kavanaugh\nSo what I can say is the most notable part of this report is what's not in it as we noted by the White House sci fi I did not interview Brett Kavanaugh\nWe have seen even more press reports of witnesses who wanted to speak with the FBI but we're not interview [laughter]\nOkay so I Love that she said what's most important\nTrue forest of witnesses [laughter] wanted to speak with the FBI but we're not interview [laughter] okay so\nI Love that she says what's most important here is what's not in it\nThat is true but not how she means it so she says what's most important as all the people you have to I didn't interview\nWell that's because the people that she's talking about could provide no corroborating evidence what's not in the report is that there is no corroborating evidence for and any of Christine Blasey Ford delegation\nInstead he said cabin ousted by and laugh at the victims\nSo here's a jerk in high school was part of the

Boswell accuser\nShe is now coming out saying the FBI investigation was surprise surprise incomplete\nHer attorneys who are democratic activists they sent out a statement it said quote an FBI supplemental background investigation that did not include an interview of Dr Christine Blasey Ford nor the witnesses to corroborate her testimony cannot be called an investigation wherever family disappointed\nThat after the tremendous sacrifice you made in coming forward those directing the FBI investigation were not interested in seeking the truth\nIf he thinks one she testified under oath at length there is no reason for the FBI to talk to her again if you'd contradictory stories you commit perjury\nThere's no there's really no reason for them to talk to her second\nThey talked to all of the witnesses\nThey gave sworn statements and those witnesses did not back her story\nWhen they say that the FBI didn't talk to the witnesses crop right who testimony there are no witnesses corroborate her testimony there's talk of went on the left that women would never falsified would never missed remember would never lie about allegations of right now I have\nTremendous sympathy for people who alleged sexual assault\nI Do I mean when when she first came forward I said this is a credible account and and I want to wait for corroborating evidence before I make a decision on that there is no corroborating evidence for coming and that's why I'm saying that Brett Kavanaugh dancing on the court I still don't know if she's telling the truth you don't know either nobody knows because there's no corroborating evidence and the witnesses\nWith that said one of the things that's been put out there by by folks on the left is that there's no incentive for women in high profile cases come forward\nI have two or three Anita Hill any to hell in a hero on the left for the last twenty five years HBO made it a whole series about her and if you think there's no incentive for women to come forward and shape the course of history\nI find that highly doubtful I mean here was time magazine cover this week or the time magazine cover this week is up Christine Blasey Ford swearing with her eyes closed and her entire face is made up of words from her testimony\nThat looked like somebody who has benefited at all from the publicity\nThat Christine Blasey Ford is one of the most worship fingers on the left today so that's not an implication that she's lying but just think that the the incentives are all stacked in one direction is just not correct It's just not objectively correct\nIt is true that Brett Kavanaugh has an interest in her story not being true but she also has an interest to get that women don't have an interest in coming forward in high profile cases\nBecause all they are going to get the downside is just it's not accurate is just not accurate again that doesn't mean she's manufacturing her case doesn't mean she's line but we ought to at least be honest about what the incentive structure is here our\nIncentive structures are in place for allegations who sometimes and he made\nIf they weren't then you wouldn't have high profile cases where women come forward and say something and it turns out that they're finding\nAre making things up\nSo that is that is a boy number one point number two there are a bunch of people who are now coming forward and making ancillary claim they have nothing to do with Kavanaugh and this is supposed to be ... be great\nTo bunker up cabinets there was a piece in USA Today that woman was promoting on Twitter in which she claimed that Brett Kavanaugh getting angry in front of the Senate is the reason that he shouldn't be on the court so remember the original reason he shouldn't be on the court would that he was conservative\nThan the reason that he shouldn't be on the court is because he allegedly committed sexual assault than when there was no corroborating evidence you shouldn't sit on the court because she was part of an angry this woman in USA Today that I remember my angry father and that's why Britain\n\n\n\nSo if you lie to impede a grand jury line of inquiry then that would be a violation of perjury charges if you're President Clinton and you suggest you did not in fact have sex with that woman that is legitimate perjury\nBut that is not the same thing as you know you asked a question about whether it's known on a particular day you know it's nobody's had rain and it has no actual material impact on the course of the investigation that's perjury okay that's not how it works so what are the lives of Brett Kavanaugh supposedly told first of all\nIt is important to note that all of his testimony was given it in the context of him being accused of a gang rape by\nAnd then they were digging through his yearbook so every claim that has been made about his wise has been that supposedly he downplayed his drinking or lives about his high school yearbook\nOr live out of high school you know now I'm not going to defend line I'm not going to pretend that of Brett Kavanaugh lied about things I think that makes them squeaky clean well let's go through a list of these opposes lies that Brett Kavanaugh told us from bling bling okay I'm going going to far less site and so it just means they're going to get\nAbout as comprehensive a view was it's actually from media matters which is comprehensive news you can come up with of Brett Kavanaugh's lives\nSo what are these impose allies have enough that he did not travel in the same social circles as porn but\nHe did and then they said well he traveled in the same social circles well what's the evidence that some of the people she says run a party with her were on his calendar\nThat's not the same social circles that six degrees of Kevin Bacon right that it's ... that's that's like saying that you know I travel in the same social circle is and you know and therefore send your friends are in my social circle that's not the same thing at all\nAlso they say that he lied when he attempted to fabricate an alibi by suggesting he did not drink on weekdays that's not true he said he rarely drink on weekdays and his own calendar and in fact you referred openly and his testimony does counters that on this day I probably drink at all I Know I probably drink 'cause it's as though on my calendar\nKavanaugh said he had no connection to Yale University prior to attending undergrad and law school there but he was led to the ... and many\nAs I'm sure he's not a legacy admitted his grandfather went to Yale in Nineteen oh eight\nNot to Yale Law school in jail as well that's that's not that's not actually\nA thing where else did he why supposedly he lied about blacking out from drinking but he didn't live out that there's no evidence that he actually did blackouts from breaking\nNow the Democrats kept using blackouts and drinking because what they're ... they were attempting to establish is that he actually tried to rape Christine Blasey Ford and just didn't remember the incident that that's what there is something that you say but there is no actual evidence of that so there is no lie there either\nNow what you couldn't tell you that he was playing his his drinking in the most favorable possible light\nI think that's fair but that's not the same thing as as perjuring yourself as lying openly will go through a couple of more of these proposed allies of bread cabinet told ... has a good for both the silver political as well but\nFirst let's talk about your sleep quality there's

and then they said we can't nominated because\nOther women had been raped by other people who are not like having a ... and then they said well we can't nominate him because he got angry and finally they came up with while he committed perjury committed perjury as well one problem\nNo evidence he committed perjury so some of the other accusations they say that have not signed in Maryland and drinking age and explaining his behavior even though he was too young to legally\nNo evidence he committed perjury so some of the other accusations they say that have not signed in Maryland and drinking age in explaining his behavior even though he was too young to legally drink in any case the only thing is that he said in his testimony he was too young to legally drink it's in the drinking age Maryland was Eighteen he said that in his testimony\nAnd then they get to the booth thing right so they suggest that say why he committed perjury charged with perjury for saying that in his year but when he was Seventeen he used the word booth to means parts and what it actually means is anal sex I'm not kidding this is what they actually are saying\nThat what that everyone knows that moving as anal sex the guy I didn't know the whole thing was was that that's where a also it turns out that there are a lot of different ways that people use the word booth also something I didn't know but there's been substantial research on the ... thing\nAnd it turns out that there is no way to substantiate that an ally also the term devil's triangle so there's ingestion\nIs it Brett Kavanaugh was using a pornographic reference about you and do it and one girl in a free some again he says that that was a drinking game it seems pretty weird way to obscure your past and drunkenness to term devil's triangle uh drinking game but again there are a bunch of people on Twitter who have said that they have heard of that as well\nAnd so they there's a bunch of people who say no when he actually meant that now let's let's remember\nWhy any of this material it's only material because us ingestion by Democrats is that he put a bunch of sexual references on his Facebook page that means you sexually assaulted a girl when he was Seventeen that in itself is an insane line of inquiry it's an insane when have you ever read a Facebook page\nAt least people ever been in high school\nI went to an all boys Jewish high school they might your ... page was clean I Can't say the same for all my friends are there are references that people didn't necessarily understand in the yearbook pages and the orthodox Jewish day school and I have a feeling that most high schools around the country are replete with such references\nJak insomnia you guys went to high school were there any obscure we're sexual references and your your book by dude\nYeah that's right too many to count is precisely the right answer because\nOf course have you ever met a teenage boy I Love all the senators were drunk and allow going really well when you were Seventeen you wrote and your your book about drinking and making sexual references\nLike okay if you're a Seventeen year old boy I've ever again have you met a Seventeen year old boy there's not a Seventeen year old boy on earth doesn't make sexual references none zero zip built by if Brett Kavanaugh downplayed that in his testimony this means he was a perjure cannot sit on the Supreme Court now that he's sixty years old\n... hey so here is a bit biased and finally they narrowed down finally they narrow it down so what is it ... they all since he got that he lied when he says that he had a weak stomach so he used to throw up a lot well maybe he had a weak stomach and he threw up because of alcohol and or spicy food\nI also have a weak stomach I throw up a lot to that could happen from drinking I've never thrown up because of drinking actually because I don't actually drink 'em but [laughter] but they managed to make it out no no no I'm I'm not I'm not desperate enough during men to show that says that the that'd be just terrible but\nIt's it's so finally they come down to one they've narrowed and on one thing one thing the ... thing in the devil's triangle all the stuff\nThat it's just a bunch of nonsense and they narrowed down to one thing and one thing only there is there only a credible claim in my opinion there only a credible claim that Brett Kavanaugh lied in his testimony they're only credible claim is that there was a reference on fourteen of the boy your book pages about a woman named ... dolphin who is an attendee of local all girls high school\nNow a few things you might need to know that when a dolphin before we actually get to the supposed ally ... dolphin was good enough friends with Brett Kavanaugh that originally she signed a letter in support of the idea that he was very good to girls when he was in high school\nShe was on that letter and she was friends with him for many many years and she signed that letter there's no accusation that she has talked to them in high school there's an accusation that he sexually assaulted her high school it was not his Asian that he touched her in high school not\nSo what exactly is the claim the claim is that on fourteen boy your book pages there was a reference to Renee alumnus referring to her\nAnd other references suggest that ... that she was ... this was a joke about ... among a bunch of guys ingesting that they were alumni of her genitals and essentially the day that there's a bunch of guys who had sex with her that when Kavanaugh was asked about this he said that this was an attempt a clumsy attempted affection among his friends\nRight that's that's what he said in his in his actual testimony and I want to see if I can grab the actual text of the testimony that I can find exactly what it is it that he was that he was claiming but the the basic suggestion of of Brett Kavanaugh is that this was not in fact\nA a reference to sex with Renee alum near the raid on this was done reference to sex with Renee\nDolphin New York times had a piece where they said that it was horrible and hurtful\nAnd here's what the New York times that they said that to a judge Kavanaugh's classmates have dimensions Renee we're part of the football players unsubstantiated boasting about their conquest and Kevin not suggesting that it was a clumsy attempt right that it was it was a clumsy attempt at uh\nThe football players unsubstantiated boasting about their conquest and Kevin not suggesting that it was a clumsy attempt right that it was it was a clumsy attempt at an action now\nMaybe that's true and maybe that's not\nBut there's no way to substantiate perjury first of all it's not material I read even materiality probation and the FBI and the deal to Emanuel and second of all\nIt is fair to say that equality or a close ally here's how he write that quote one thing in particular we were at about one of our good one of our good female friends looted Myron when dances with had her name used on our Web page with the term alumnus that's almost ... you yourself action to show she was one of us\nPeople um and and their stories of of of

N. A. L. more Washington comes to talking\nI'm John ...\nSyria and Russia are separate story from Iran and Russia because of the ongoing conflict because of the promises made and question is blood and treasure butter my clothing has invested a deal of boats and\nRight now a lot of our potent is quoted most recently in the times of Israel saying all foreign troops should leave Syria after the war\nI guess Malcolm that means the Iranians to I suppose that would be the logic of that and Turks and everybody else but after the war is the catchphrase how does that happen we welcome bars Silverman who can help us to get this\nCareful lawyers language by the former KGB agent a bar is a very good evening to a foundation the defense of democracies we take you to Syria the recent shoot down to the Russians surveillance crap\nLed to twenty four forty eight hours of turmoil in the Kremlin and in Jerusalem and in Damascus blame shifting the Russians responded by saying we'll issue as three hundred system\nTo the Syrians who had managed to shoot down a Russian craft\nFollowing er during an Israeli airstrike or how do you measure the relationship between Damascus in the Clinton than right now is it one of confidence is it was on a disk trust is there a betrayal of foot good evening to bars\nA gaming and thanks for having me on I think the episode is certainly a thing for ... and you have a client fatter regime shutting down whenever you're on an aircraft wave weapons that you're at fault them in a long while ago after hundreds\nUm how ... systems that really can't tell friend her phone I've kind of one on one of one of the problems there for the for the Russians are but it's deeply embarrassing and I think they use this as an excuse\nTo transfer to ask three hundreds to the Syrians would resort video of earlier this week I'm there and why do it for twenty Thirteen earlier I had to deal with Israelis back or twenty Thirteen to not do it I'm obviously the the\nExcuse that they've been looking forward to quickly editor for the transfer\nWe had very complicated situation this is a one reflection of it when you have the as three hundred are coming in addition to the U.S two hundred but we have an ally turkey a NATO member who's getting the S. four hundred supposedly the most advanced the system is are the\nThe Chinese and there'd been threats by the U.S about sanctions on your cats or\nAre they countering America's adversaries who sanctions act and other um measured what do you see the the us reaction now both regarding turkey and trying to do they go to the mat on it and how will the effect Turkey's relationship though it within the Russian orbit\nEerily quiet a criminal ministry issued the sanctions that cats are related sanctions against Chinese\nOne guy neither agency and the Chinese individuals and executive director of that is right for their purchase of as four hundred bucks a call at thirty five fighter jets off I think that's certainly a shock to the Chinese are today Turks\nI'm just report today that the enemies and they're putting on hold a there are parts of the court thirty fire fighter jets because of their concern about sanctions [laughter] so I should be taking this seriously that um you know that conversation has worn turkey that this could lead to sanctions\nIn certain about sanctions so\nI should be taking this seriously that um you know the conversation has worn turkey that this could lead to sanctions and now that they follow through on sanctions and kind of set the precedent what China\nUm you know the the the light should be flashing red or for turkey whether they actually stop 'em you know I I I'm pessimistic I think they go they go through and I\nThought boy I Want to press you on how the Russians deal with Syrians in Damascus Russian military intelligence is excellent Russian networks are first prayed throughout the middle east always have been there are a lot of Russians married Syrian so there's a ... there's a comfort here working and you know\nDo the Russians trust that I saw it in any fashion they totally penetrated his organization did they know everything all the time\n[noise] I have one person basically making decisions I don't know if they know everything all the time but they've got no alternative they have this\nKind of multigenerational forty nine year basing deal with the Assad regime for a base in Tartus a naval base it on the air base there I mean I'm In so they they're holding on there's no there's no political alternative for them they don't they don't see anybody I'll second\nBasically guarantee 'em their equities and in Syria so I'm not sure it's a if it's a matter of crossing or not but it's that's the kind of\n[laughter] they've got a foothold now in the Levant and Assad is\nThe partner for that I'm and I'm not sure you know how ... there's no there's no other way to ... for them to move\nAnd as far as it relates to the United states or Israel or are there key players and the reason that just kind of the reality now and we do the Russians are doing with Assad as they are and Israelis are kind of dealing it would do with Assad regime in a very I'm kind of realistic way and\nI'm targeting what they need to target and same with the Iranians um and so I think it's a it's more of the actions than than any trust to having maybe here when they give the three hundred and ... to ... it's more about making sure that as the kind of\nThat crack troops that Assad hazard or really lax uh don't end up sitting up there on aircraft as we saw when this incident that they have something that's more advanced now that can actually tell Russian aircraft from Israeli aircraft are from you know other aircraft\nDo we have another front where we're seeing a an ally I'm moving closer to Russia in some regards to visit a prison and you'd see Egypt\nTo Russia I think when this empty to Sochi do you see this as a an opportunity for Russia to establish another base now the deep consolidated the hold in Syria a naval air force base they long sought\nBased in in each of what what else could be on the agenda for them\nSo they've had I mean it's I think it's just it's a fascinating trip on the seventeenth I mean is it an Egypt cc's previously visited Russia as well uh they've signed kind of a slew of military and economic cooperation deals but on the military side we haven't seen\nSome of the kind of basic things come to fruition yet and so that's that's in my mind is that the key thing on the agenda the Soviets had some basis in in western I'm\nIn western Egypt do they want to revive somebody's airbases to they want to revive some naval kind of access they had um military and they were actually had to Egypt in front porch there so I think that's what's really interesting here to wash\nThat this trip is coming about fairly quickly um and again builds on already military and economic ideals have made in the past couple of years so it's it's it should be concerning for the U.S where you have\nFor traditional ally I'm continuing to gotta get get cozy or what the Russians and part of that is we're we're not engaging with them you know we still\nI'm Still waiting for a in a bathroom either to be named the state department or David Shenk or there was a factor for Near East still has not been um confirmed by the Senate\nUm so they're still we're we're kind of still playing this game of of catch up on the diplomatic front while the Russians are clearly pushing I had\nJust a detail here about where we are in the scheme of things the principal and guns rainy five dollars and I'm told\nBy informed sources that it's headed towards a hundred dollars to go to cycle it's nothing different about the Iranian upset is affecting it does that give Russia more leverage in the world because their coffers are good above sixty dollars a barrel\n[noise] they're they're they're tricky position where they are I think they're they're planning for around fifty five dollars for their budgets they do they actually can't domestically deal with [noise]\nPrices are a hundred hundred more because they you know they had their their own domestic impressed\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I share your view about the crown prince and met him in and think that that he wants to do the right thing and he has implemented some steps the reforms regarding women and others but the unfortunate too many of them are backfiring and he he's operating\nWith the somebody's strikes against them at this point so do you see Iran exploiting the situation now and it was what was it was before my John about the domestic reaction it seems young people buy into the twenty thirty\nYou ... to stay in a large enough number to continue with it\nI think you're exactly right Malcolm that the reason he's been able to do a number of the things that have done which in in a Saudi contacts thinking historically are really quite astounding I'm not sure any of us would have believed some of the step cities\nHe's taking not only on them the empowering women are advocating on behalf of moderate Islam a flashing\nSubsidies to the Saudi population and really entering a ... a fundamental renegotiation of the Saudi social contract between its citizens and the regime in a in a very courageous way [noise]\nAh and yet he uh I I think that the longer he is not able to produce\nOn some of these targets with regard to building the private sector building human capital and Saudi society employing\nPeople and meaningful jobs in the private sector [noise] uh I think the more trouble or he's going to court and the more that support will will dissipate which is again why I think to some of these recent moves that is clearly scared the investor class\nFrom uh getting into Saudi Arabia and the way they need to if these reforms are going to be ... be sustainable\nUh is is a serious problem and I do think greater greater sense that the United states is they're actively consulting with him behind the scenes rather than the sense I have\nThat the Trump Administration as it is it has kind of got their policy right now on auto pilot a in a way that I I think has a has given him too much running room to make the kinds of rookie mistakes that he's making\nIn certain ah both on the foreign policy front and the domestic front and I I just think he needs more active American helped\nUh to to get him out of some of these situations before the Iranians can really exploited\nThe failure he was judged harshly for it does he have a plan to repair\n[noise] he does have a plan he's now a rather than uh going uh onto the stock exchanges he wants to simply get to use aramco to take out a more foreign debt I'm a and he's also a kind of pressure to ram code to\nPurchase a major pet ...\nPetrochemical company that uh is owned by the Saudi Government\nUh neither aramco no now nor the petrochemical company or\nParticularly excited about this or that may give him some of the funds he needs to ah to a finance some of the vision twenty thirty reforms\nBut it won't give him the kind of transparency and accountability that he would've got ... and said that he wanted to achieve by lifting aramco on one of the major western or exchanges unfortunately were\nYou surprised when they pulled the sale because there was a sense in London that that that things were tipping into disaster [noise]\nYou know I Can't say I was surprised John this has been a he announced it in the very beginning of twenty sixteen the great fanfare and it's really been one rumor of delay after the other opposition from within aramco as well as within the royal\nFamily ah\nReally bad one room or a delay after the other opposition from within aramco as well as within the royal family\nUh and uh [noise]\nSo by the time it went down finally at the end of August and they fired the bankers said higher too at the float a aramco I really didn't come as any great shock to me it was a disappointment of cars parked jets because NBS his Hong so much of twenty thirty and its success\nOn his ability to to get this ideal out what she said and and and brag was going to be the largest idea when in history\nHis upcoming visit to Kuwait is this a further attempt to to strengthen the regional effort against Qatar did they see them as an intermediary with with the butter on one hand in second can they reacted they that area between the two for oil production which would give them additional income\nYeah I I rarely see this as a less about cut her then then the the oil field that they share and getting that production up there talking about it could be as much as five hundred\nThousand barrels a day which as we all know because of these looming Iranian sanctions markets are clearly quite quite nervous about whether the Saudis can can really cover the Iranian barrels that may be\nLost and if they were able to get this field with Kuwait back up and running it it would it would obviously be a major plot said clearly under a lot of pressure\nFrom President Trump anybody who reads that section of his speech at a young guy and the way he came down on OPEC like a ton of bricks\nI understand that the I think the Saudis are really feeling the pressure that they've got to meet the president demand on on on this issue in light of the Iranian sanctions question\nAnd oil at a hundred dollars does that affect anybody's decision making and Saudi Arabia\nAddress courage John I think they you know obviously vision twenty thirty was triggered largely by an MBA that's his view that uh that oil is is not going to be around forever he's driven in it that's why he knows what that\nThe future may be a for a while and uh if if the prices now go through the roof I actually I'm a little bit worried that it makes it easier for him to\nPut off some of that the tougher reforms that he's been he's been contemplating but well boy to see how it how that plays out\nJohn Hannah

I'm about to be the tear gas against\nUs mad help Russia Russia will doesn't want to see Iran and certainly ... getting these weapons so doesn't isn't Israel during the dirty work and then\nI think that Russia doesn't carry the ball gets these weapons on doesn't care that much if Iran continues to bring into ah the weapons into Syria into base from which can operate against these or they don't care that much they don't care if we take action to prevent it but they don't care if the if it does happen\nAnd all our efforts to convince the the rest of the way to prevent Iran from being that\nWe're so I'm now\nAnd all our efforts to convince the rest of the way to prevent Iran from going into a ... or so I'm now a say in the ... much more complicated situation if you can make a ... for\n... against the Iranian or the the the\n[noise] but I think that for the one other because it's going to happen now is the Russia\nShe will make sure that has to be now much more ... than who spoke in preventing Iran from bringing the weapon because otherwise we'll have to operate in the presence of the three hundred and one of the ... I mean we already started a few months and\nThe you know dangerous and make\nClosing the skin Asian if there would be able to shut down and he's really playing this is going to be in for a while I was gonna say I have to take this into account\nGenerally go see Cooper fought so the ... Center for public affairs ...\n... am six thirty Washington Mall ...\nBut it was a fascinating a time for me because what I think I learned is that a lot of these smaller countries who have for our very risque or resource constrained have become a lot more creative and I think we have become in terms of how we manage business\nUm and so there are a lot of those types of lessons that I'm trying to to bring here to the navy\nI Want to apply this to a real time concept which is a naval education I talk all the time to the Naval War college I in fact in fact I spoke to professor Jim homes last night about the Decatur incident and I learned a deal jobs in the Naval War college\nIt's a it's a pleasure because that is that's see that's the ideas of the navy for the last hundred years there is also the Naval Academy where you spoke so how does on ability or a clean sheet review I think that's a technocrat technical term how does that apply to the institutions educational lead you to ... and the navy\nWhile John I think that that at the end of the day uh are competitive advantage I think in this country is always going to be um our ability to thank our adversaries or whether that's in a business or in war\nAnd so as we look at the future of the navy and where the navy should be headed in our whole defense or a stylish and should be headed it's really aware if you look at success for organizations a private sector or whatever the ones that have really done well and this and this era of rapid change are the ones that are the most agile\nAnd so I'm ... from my perspective what that means is that we had to have agile forces on the ground that can adapt and be innovative collaborate be transparent and what they do and do things a lot more quickly than they do that now but that would that also means that we need to have people who have agile minds\nUm and I think that for me is going to be our biggest competitive advantage into what I've done one of the first things I did when I came here with secretary Spencer\nTo launch a something we call the ... for ... study which is education for sea power study\nAnd uh we we assemble the board of some very intelligent and experience folks to take a look at our educational institutions in the navy and reassess them from a clean sheet perspective you know nothing was off the table to give us some advice and guidance on how we can sort of prepare this\nUh education and to create our educational institutions but also to create sort of continuous learning and create a learning organization in the navy\nThey're about to a release their findings here in the next couple of weeks and I suspect that we're going to be doing some reorganization is to adjust to that um to the institution sort of individually or doing well but we do not have an enterprise view on uh on where we need to\nTo go forward into this next into this century with respect to creating the types of agility and education and thinking that we are going to need to to be successful\nThomas is part of the force structure assessment that I've read in the news is coming in November his education part of that\nNo it wouldn't be it would be a complement to that John to force structure assessment Israeli purely looking at a if you look at sort of the the the three hundred and fifty five ship goal are really looking at that and determining OK what does that mix going to look like one of the ships going to look like\nA how are they going to operate a what is distributed lethality mean how does that how does that play into the equation and a lot of the things that you've talked to to Jerry Hendricks about and others in gym homes and others are on your show\nI see so education is special here no let me let me apply this because I I enjoy listening to your speech to the Naval Academy and especially the camera shots of the young people in the audience uh what are they asking for at the Naval Academy that they don't know have I Know just because I've been reporting on this that the army has stood up something or the future command\nWhich is a way of talking about cyberspace and are thinking of this\nSo that the army has stood up something called the future command which is a way of talking about cyberspace and are thinking of the future in digital Lee is the ... does the navy have something comparable I'm I'm an educated in this so I I'm just I'm just searching to\nWell I think I think distributed across the navy were thinking about a lot of these things I think one of the purposes of the a forest study is to try and capture that and create a strategy a and orchestrate that more and a coordinated way to ensure that\nFor example what's happening at the work of colleges complementary to what we're what we're doing at the Naval Academy the post graduate school as well out in Monterey it's a it's an incredible research institution but I think it's been under utilized with respect to integrating what the private sector um and also with integration into the fleet\nSo that we can use what's being research there to actually advance our war fighting capability\nSo um it's really a it's a really a holistic view at what we're doing in education and where it should go it it's interesting John ... back about a hundred years ago there was something called the knocks king high report which really looked at the same problem for the navy or in a in Nineteen Eighteen\nAnd the conclusions of that study basically set the groundwork for the types of thinking and types of education and the focus on strategy that all of our leaders in World War two and the navy for ... pie and it was a was essential to our ability to be successful in that conflict\nI'm going to guess that's the study that center and is king and bill ... and ... back to school to learn how to fly something like that future is aviation yes\nUm and you are aviation you are in the U.S navy retired aviator and I'm going to call upon just

S. capitalist system\nIs to beat the campaign is anti Israel activism and so when I see Andrew Gillum so closely tied in fact we put a photo of a Andrew Gillum from his Facebook page and two thousand and four team\nIn which he says quote could not be prouder of Philip avenue and again avenue is the founder of dream defenders that he wrote a glowing profiled out to me I think Andrew Gillum needs to be asked some serious questions about\nHis deep association and promotion of a group that is anti Israel anti capitalist while he is trying to portray himself\nAs the opposite as pro Israel or even while I've gone through interviews that he gave as recently as just a few months ago where he a hot strongly criticized the Israeli military and their response in Gaza and really set some anti Israel\nWhy does why does the mayor of Tallahassee talk about what goes on in gossip how does that connect their\nUnless he seemed to have been trying to position himself even there for support from\nThese protests have grown so that's what he has in common with Gillibrand these are two agile actors in the progressive part of the Democratic party seeking funds by speaking against Israel does it work\nAnd the oh not only does it work but actually that's probably how Andrew Gillum defeated ah Gwen Graham who was his opponent Democrat primary what happened was\nToward the end the last like two months or less of the primary where Andrew Gillum was trailing her um Soros stare dream defenders and actually a coalition of other radical groups that I'm going to get to and the next few weeks in my investigations they poured in millions and millions of\nDollars so that he he beat her do it just practical on ... part if you speak against Israel the crowd will give you money are inclined watching Gillum and watching ... brand for Breitbart Jerusalem I'm John bachelor there's the John ...\n\n... am six thirty Washington long you been down\nOn a five point not F ... am six thirty Washington Mall W.
