Ollie we make no promises are guarantees of investment performance on line trading academy is not a broker dealer certified financial planner or register investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nWelcome to the do yourself investors show is Chris ... joined the do's and don'ts of the financial markets exact source sponsor online training academy shows contributions to show ...\nTraining academy has been helping individuals like you become do it yourself investors since Nineteen Ninety seven online training Academy of two campuses to serve our listening audience one and Tyson's corner and one near BWI Airport\nAnd one of the things we talk about on this show a lot is starting to make businesslike decisions with your money\nAnd looking at yourself like a business and so one of the things when you get into today is really expanding out on how we help our students\nStart looking at themselves like a business and then start making more systematic more consistent decisions to generate more consistent income for the rest of their lives\nAnd so you know one of the programs that we have that really helps her students that are most serious called the mastermind community and the mastermind community has a number of different services related to it\nOne is a daily market overview for people that are actively trading in the markets there's also a over\nHundreds of opportunities in\nWhat we call the supply and demand grid for over thirty five different assets every\nDay there are opportunities identified in the stock market identified the futures market identify the forest market identified an options for people that are able to implement income strategies and the various markets\nThere's also a a an opportunity to interact with students from all around the world as well as our instructors and orange structures are all professional traders and they give people the opportunity to start thinking differently about their money\nAnd in this day and age when more and more people are looking for a second stream of income whether it's you know renting out real estate whether it's super driving or you know charging these motor scooters that you see all over the place you know people are looking for other ways to generate income\nSince ... driving or you know charging these motor scooters that you see all over the place you know people are looking for other ways to generate income and there really is no better way to generate income than in the financial markets\nBecause part of this as it's not about giving you another full time job but part of this is how do you fit into your life\nEight seven seven zero for a seven to three\n... in your free half day class\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills or even just having the luxury of not working so hard\nTo have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share but there's all kinds of stories here's what one recent graduate had to say\nI bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different needed my time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... happy and career and training that's something that I had always wanted to death and so if I die for that had a chemical or start that changed my life I've\nLearned more visitors on line that free O T a class down Tom that's free OT a class dot com\nWelcome back to the duty herself investors show thanks to Rob for joining us and part of that is just to give me a kind of a taste of orange structures and you know their perspective and understanding why they want to be part of this community because if you were\nA Goldman Sachs trader like say you're the wolf of Wall Street or something like that you're not sitting at home rolling out of bed in your pajamas and starting to trade\nOr showing identify opportunities you're going to put on your best suit you're going to surround yourself with like minded people before you do anything part of your systematic approach to the markets is you're going to reach out to your experts from around the world\nThey're going to allow you to understand what's happening in the markets what's going on out there\nAnd that's why our instructors are part of us as they recognize that if they were by themselves they would just be picked off one by one but by being part of a community by being part of a collective that makes them better and makes them stronger and makes them more likely\nTo be able to generate income for the rest of their lives so that's why people join us so people participate in our mastermind community\nAnd just recognized and where are we in the current market and you know we've got interest rates are now breaking out and shooting up so if you have a fixed mortgage that may not impact you however if you've ever planned to apply\nFor a credit for a new car your credit cards will probably go up so interest rates going up have the potential to impact you but they really have a massive\nImpact on the companies that have been borrowing like mad in the low interest rate environments in the last ten years and so as interest rates go up and there's some threat to these companies that have been borrowing borrowing and borrowing\nAnd the interest that basically they're increased interest bills will impact their ability to use their profits effectively so the increase interest rates will have an impact has already starting\nTo have an impact on the stock market you know J. P. Morgan is moving from growth stocks to what's known as value stocks so more kind of consumer staples utilities and\nPart of that is their identifying with higher interest rates kind of a go go days are going to start slowing down it's going to be less money sloshing around [noise]\nAnd so for those who are in passive investments for those of you who are using the accumulation model preservation strategies from the financial services folks you know you're exposed out there to this higher interest rate environment\nAnd not only are interest rates go higher but oil is going higher so an oil goes higher than your gas bill goes higher\nAnd that drives up the cost of other other expenses so as the trade wars continue you know some things have been settled so we have you know the agreements with Canada Mexico United States but with China and other places you know in January\n... likely going to be a much higher tariffs on things coming in from China as much as twenty five percent of everything [noise]\nAnd so there's some cost pressures to go with these interest rate pressures which no matter what no matter where you stand on whether it's good or bad you're going to need more money to pay your bills you're going to need more income and one of the things we know is that life is a do it yourself projects\nYou're going to need more money to pay your bills you're going to need more income\nAnd what are the things we know is that life has to do it yourself projects you know all the things you're proud of life\nYou've done yourself whether it was your education your career even if it was just a project around the house and those are things that make you feel good those are things that bring a smile to your face you know those are things that make you feel warm inside and when it comes to your income the reality is you're going to need more\nDo you want to feel warm inside about your income strategies do you want to feel warm and decide that\nYou have it under control that no matter what happens you've got a way to generate income today\nAs well as for the rest of your life and that's being a ... herself investors all about giving yourself the opportunity to get more out of your assets and really get more out of life\nAnd so you know what we wanted to do is start thinking of yourself like a business so you can start making businesslike decisions with your money\nAnd I understand there's a huge temptation to turn over your financial well being to some stranger there's a huge temptation to turning over your financial well being to someone you've never met turn it over to someone who doesn't have your best interests at heart because you've been told that\nThat's a safer thing to do than you doing it yourself\nAnd the reason you think that is you don't have any hope you don't have any confidence you don't have any optimism related to your finances\nAnd part of what education provides you if it's focused education and one of his income education our first step and helping you become and do it yourself investor is building up your financial hope and you do that by understanding some of the terminology by understanding how the markets operate\nAnd getting some actual hands on experience and seeing some of these great opportunities for you\nThen developing your financial confidence is about you're getting your hands on understanding how to protect your assets how to get your money out of harm's way and be able to make safer and smarter decisions with your money and actually doing it and see it in action\nAnd then you build up your financial optimism when you've taken the time to develop a systematic approach [noise] based on a proven strategy\nBased on understanding how to leverage or assets in a safer smarter way than what you're currently do and\nAnd also understanding risk and making sure that for any risk you take you have the opportunity for a greater award and as you build a business on this framework and do it based on your experience in what you're trying to accomplish where you're at in life\nThen all of a sudden you're going to start getting about warm feeling about your finances and that's really what we can deliver for you for those of you who want to start learning about becoming a do it yourself investor it's about giving yourself the opportunity\nTo get more out of your assets and start making businesslike decisions with your money and we've talked about how you know this is the best business in the world they can fit it into your lifestyle you have no you don't have to ask permission to be successful in this but you do have to take action\nYou know you need to be able to care about your results enough\nAnd say you know what my assets need to work harder for me\nAnd the and one of the beauty of this business is recession proof no matter what happens in the economy no matter what happens in the market there are opportunities for you to generate income\nAnd this is the reality in a with interest rates going up with the oil getting more expensive with the shift from growth stocks to value stocks that's telling us that the market is setting up for a significant pull back in two thousand Nineteen\nAnd base the markets have been juiced with the tax cut this year\nBut as the reality starts setting in the higher interest rates as the reality of the higher cost based on oil the higher cost based on tariffs the higher costs just related to kind of a higher friction economy\nThere's going to be less opportunity in the market which if you're using passive strategies will likely result in a pull back and one of the things that the stock market is that it generally will pull back about six months prior to a recession heading\nAnd well what we see is that as costs get higher there's you know things are driving up so we're going to have an opportunity in two thousand Nineteen\nTo be able to benefit from a falling market and we've already seen kind of the crash you've had the guns the sheer kind of a warning signs and just over this last week we're starting to see kind of cracks in the foundations of the stock market move\nThere still opportunity for it to charge up but at the same time we're already seeing\nIn terms of the stock market move there still opportunity for it to charge up but at the same time we're already seeing kind of set up for the dam and so you owe it to yourself you owe it to your family you owe to your future\nTo start learning how to protect your assets to start learning how to position your assets more effectively and learning how to profit from your assets because if a recession comes and you know we've had the longest bull market and history\nOr in a in a small suburb outside of Washington DC and I went door to door four times in my first year to those seven hundred houses\nAnd I delivered things of value that had my name on them and the first time I went through in nobody knew I was in the second and the third or fourth time still\nKind of difficult but as I went\nThrough the neighborhood year after year after year\nI was able to build relationships\nAnd start to develop sales\nWith me I'll tell you more just among the\nThey are you thinking about selling your home do you want to know how to sell your home fast and for the most money Hi I'm Eric Stewart and I'm the host appointing you home right here on W. M. A. L. and I'd like to invite you to join me for my flagship seminar and how to sell your home for top dollar in Maryland to hand in Virginia in October\nIt's free foot space is limited and it's filling up fast so called today eight hundred nine hundred and Ninety One oh four that's eight hundred nine hundred Ninety One oh four four register online at Eric Stewart groups\nReally date now we can get rid of doors\nFarming is or what we call [noise]\nWhen you take a neighborhood or an area and you consistently and faithfully deposit into that area now cultivating it recognizing before you walk into the forum whether the soil is good in real estate means you decide that\nYou you've got a neighborhood that someone else is not just dominating\n[laughter] it doesn't make sense when you're first starting out to try to beat the king farmer who's got Seventy percent of the business in an area you're better off to find another form not waste your time now waste your money you may be\nThe set and you know you may be very stubborn and want to pursue it that's fine but just fair warning you would probably do better\nIf you looked at finding another farm\n[noise] now in this particular area there seven hundred houses\nAnd I got my first listing about two months into forming a knocked on the guy's door and I was delivering at this point a jar of apple butter the apple butters particularly wonderful because it is it's something it's in a jar so it's not going to spoil if it's an open\nAnd I put a label on top of the jar with my name and my face and wish them a nice fall with a little card that was attached and if somebody wasn't home I left that card behind with the apple butter and [noise]\nAnd ah you know this is Nineteen eighty seven says thirty one years ago when I first started\nWell Allen corn men who moved ultimately to uh California is sold his small brick ramblers with me for a hundred and Fifteen thousand dollars in Nineteen eighty seven and it was the first lifting that I took as a result of farming\nAnd Mr corn and when I came to his door and I was just knocking saying Hi and I'm dressed in this time and I've got French cuffs and suspenders on which is pretty popular back at that point [noise]\nAnd ah I'm I'm all of twenty three years of age I've got nothing but energy and and zero maturity when it comes to a ... how to interact with um you know with people who own real estate I you know sold pizzas for goodness sake I hadn't so real estate yet but I didn't really know what I was doing I just had a lot of energy and a willingness to learn\nThe corner and said yeah well we're thinking about it and I said oh oh oh oh oh oh I can make a note of this so I wrote down the corners address got his name and number nice of do you mind if I you know call you and the other day and he said no that's fine and we could set up a time and sure enough went out and met with Mr Mrs Corman and\nI felt that the price was was good and we were in the middle of a bull market at that time prices were rising between Ninety five in Nineteen Ninety because interest rates had finally started to come down off their Hodge um you know I think it was like eleven and a half percent [laughter]\nBut that was down from where it had been a few years before I got the business at Eighteen Nineteen or even twenty percent\nIf you think of real estate as a stool with three legs farming could be one of those legs on a stool it is\nIf you think of real estate as a stool with three legs\nFarming could be one of those legs on a stool it is one way for you to develop a strong means of of income if you're willing to get out if you don't have a lot of money which at that time I didn't have a lot of money or nothing but time\nSo I was buying note pads I bought yardsticks that we're a little bit larger they're a little bit longer yardsticks there were a a meter and so and they had some corny phrase on it like stick with a name you can trust Eric Stewart and my phone number okay [laughter]\nOh yeah yeah and then I had another one like a couple of years later there was a hit huge it was the it was the flies water with a hole in the middle yeah it said get the flight chance but don't take a chance when it comes time to sell cars Aaron [laughter]\nThanks Jen you're keeping me on today for sure so um [noise] anyway but you know what's more important than the thing although it's good to have something people will remember you buy and tell their friends look at this plus water with a hole in the middle [noise]\nIt is that personal attention and that dripping in relationship that will cause success and cause you to win position\nAs people are thinking which is why major corporations such as McDonalds Coca Cola and others are constantly advertising not necessarily with a call to action\nBut with a branding exercise so you see that name you see that name you see that name and so\nYou know I went through a period of my life where I just love to McDonald's then there was a period of life where I just said I don't really want to go to McDonalds but then there's another period a life where I really want to go to McDonalds now I really like going to McDonald's for a long time because I've been a much more healthy eater\nOver the last Fifteen Years of my life and McDonald's didn't really have a healthy appetite pleasing kind of\nPlatter of food for me to buy their salads are okay yes sure but lots of sugar fried foods and so on now they've turned a corner there are definitely seeing the move towards organic they're definitely seeing the move towards healthier foods and so\nThey're branding though you know they're just always out there always out there are always out there and that's what I tried to do by being ... door to door knocking on doors and sharing\nWho I was let people know and so putting something in the mail little newsletter about the neighborhood\nI Would knock on folks doors and just say I I just wanted you to know how grateful I Am for the home that I sold two blocks away we got a great price for it I Hope you have a great Christmas here's a little something of value I never asked them to call me I never asked them for anything I just gave them something of value and just wish them well\nAnd uh you know ultimately it was just a good natured knocking on doors and pursuit that way the generated opportunities for me to sell lots and lots and lots of houses [noise]\nAnd I I took that stool with that one leg and I expanded that leg into another geographical area\nAnd a third geographical area and in my first six or seven years I'd moved from seven and a hundred houses to about five thousand houses that I was knocking on now that's fine that's a lot of houses and that's a lot of apple butter [noise]\nBut I I realized too I guess it was in two thousand and four about Seventeen years in a real estate that I I wanted to use some of the skills that I had gone to college for an acting [noise] and\nI had a ... what are the guys working for me at the time it was a good marketing guys said hey you should consider doing radio [noise]\nWell he reached out to um a a station actually buddy of mine reached out to me from another station and said hey you should think about doing radio and I thought well stars or in my eyes maybe I'm going to get my own show maybe they'll maybe they'll put me on the air and somebody has finally found me [laughter]\nI remember thinking in all arrogance thinking oh yeah I have been discovered you know here's how that discovery worked I sat with my friends from the radio station and they said we want to give you half an hour\nFor your radio show\nAnd I'm like oh my gosh I Can't believe this is his great half an hour for radio show we want to give you a half hour for your radio show so that you can communicate to an audience who will call you to sell their houses and this way you can leverage\nYour message to all of the listeners and I'm thinking of you know an old timer radios everybody sitting there listening to Eric Stewart telling his life story like he is right now [laughter]\nWell you got all the way to the end of the present\nDay she turns the final and give it to you for only a hundred thousand dollars\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nYeah that's pretty much how it was [noise] so [noise] you know and frankly\nWhen you're on the radio you're talking to a microphone and there's nobody across from you other than your ornery engineer who throws drops on your pieces all day long like Ken uh but you know but seriously I'm Talking to you like you're my friend I don't see you but you're listening\nWhy did you know any of these things come from\nThem carelessly underground me for my hand I always recycling never trust
