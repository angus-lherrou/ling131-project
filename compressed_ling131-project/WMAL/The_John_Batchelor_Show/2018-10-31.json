to the bench repair shop that a lot to get to today I Want to talk about the nature of anti Semitism the relationship between rhetoric and violence but we begin today with the president of the United states make them kind of a shocking announcement he says he wants to push for an executive order that would outlaw birthright citizenship the president of the United states\nHas now said in an interview that he is interested in signing an executive order that would end birthright citizenship for illegal immigrant children so here is the way the law currently operate if you come to the United states for virtually any purpose unless you were born diplomat\nYou come to the United states they have a baby in the United states that baby is automatically a citizen of the United states entitled to All right and privileges conferred upon all citizens of the United states the reason that this is a controversial issue is because nothing in the constitution actually said that the case not only does nothing in the constitution actually say that this is the case\nThere's pretty good evidence that the framers of the fourteenth amendment had no intent to do anything remotely like this suggests that just because you come to the United states and then you have a baby hear your baby is now the United states citizen and this does have some pretty significant cost involved\nRight now you have in California is in many stories about that you've had situations where\nLegitimate birth tourism is happening people are traveling to the United states just to have babies in the United states that their kids become American citizen\nAnd there's some pretty significant impact the center for Immigration Studies which is very anti illegal immigration\nThey estimate that between three hundred and four hundred thousand children orange illegal immigrants in the United states every single year meaning one out of every ten birds in the United states to any legal and mother all of those children are considered by the executive branch US government the U.S citizens enjoying the same rights and privilege as\nAs the children of us citizens the population of U.S born children with illegal alien parents has expanded rapidly from two point three million into thousand three to four million dollars in aid and that's not include children who are Eighteen years of age or older the actual figure\nIs actually somewhat larger\nAll of the benefits that are available to American citizens are obviously available to these American citizens there's a lot of talk about illegal immigration not having a tremendous impact\nOn the American economy\nBecause he legal immigrants are barred from federal welfare for example there are children however are not and this does lead to chain migration because children are now us citizens and they can sponsor their parents for the United states citizenship the center for Immigration Studies suggest\nThat many of the welfare costs associated with illegal immigration are due to current birthright citizenship policy they take greater effort to barring illegal aliens from federal welfare programs do not reduced cost because the kids\nAnd the welfare costs associated with illegal immigration are due to current birthright citizenship policy they say greater effort to barring illegal aliens from federal welfare programs do not reduced cost because the kids are still American citizens\nNationwide forty percent of the illegal alien hot headed households receiving some type of welfare in some states the rate is higher in New York forty nine percent receive welfare and California forty eight percent only Nineteen percent households headed by native born citizens make use of a major welfare programs in other words illegal alien who have\nThe Supreme Court ruled that ... was a child born in the United states where legal resident Chinese immigrant couple was included in birthright citizenship again that was a legal resident that's more like a case of my parents in law and my and my brother in law and he was born in the United states to legal resident parents and therefore he's an American citizen fine\nThis was not due to the question we legal immigrant children was not adjudicated all the way until Nineteen eighty two coming up we're going to discuss the Supreme Court case that really speaks\nTo whether the children of illegal immigrants are American citizens and has always Supreme Court dominated by policy has been for decades or have a high watermark for you know you're\nTalking about what family

Supreme Court this case basically was about whether the state of Texas could deny educational benefits to children of illegal immigrants so kids were born in the United states they were the children of illegal immigrants and the question was do they actually have to be given free public education at the cost of the state\nSenate pensions that now the Supreme Court said yes that's his his left that left the Supreme Court there's no evidence that this is really accurate but this is a good ruling\nJustice William Brennan a very leftist judge wrote in a footnote quote no plausible distinction with respect to fourteenth amendment jurisdiction can be drawn between resident alien she's ... into the United states was lawful and resident alien sees entry was unlawful\nWell that obviously is bull crap okay we make distinctions along those lines all the time all the time we are constantly making a legal distinction\nBetween resident alien who came here lawfully in resident aliens who came her own awfully like for example if you're a resident alien you came here ... we can deport you enter America law if you're a resident alien came her lawfully we cannot to barrio\nUnder American law at least not without some sort of violation so this is simply a nonsense opinion now just because it's a nonsense opinion does not mean that does not have some sort of legal standing it does\nAnd the fact is that there is legal standing for for ... versus do but that means that when President Trump says that he can simply issue an executive order and overrule that Supreme Court ruling\nOr overrule the federal laws that have taken that have taken precedence\nIn in order to ensure the quote what rights of of children of illegal immigrants\nThat's not correct an act of Congress might be able to do it maybe not in any case it was going to go to the Supreme Court and that's really what this is all about President Trump was going to sign an executive order and then this is going to be litigated all the way to the top of the Supreme Court at which point the Supreme Court will would rule and all this\nIs from really going to do all this going on\nAnd when I see folks on the left are very very upset about Trump talking bad executive orders this way I don't like executive orders this way either I don't think this is what the executive branch should be doing executive branch\nDoes not have the power nor does it have the capacity to rewrite laws or rewrite the constitution I felt that way about Iraq Obama rewriting the last to simply suggest was not going to prosecute illegal immigrants and I don't like it when President Trump says he can rewrite the laws with regard to birthright citizenship from the offices the presidency the president is not a king executive branch is not a monarchy\nWhat is this really about what is that the truth is the president if he wants to pursue something like that he does have a Republican Congress could push Congress for a law\nHe does have Republican Senate he can push the Senate for law\nThis is really about ... up the base in advance and the twenty eighth election\nAnd it ties into what President Trump key argument has always been with regard to immigration going all the way back in twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen which is that we are far too nice about illegal immigration in this country than there are a lot of folks are suggesting that is red red with regard to the caravan is over the top\nIn some ways it's accurate and somebody says I Want to be there as I can do about the president and his critics when it comes to\nHis treatment of this my grand caravan the migrant caravan is indeed a publicity stunt I mean there's just no question that that's what it as it's being\nWhen it comes to his treatment of this migrant caravan the migrant caravan is indeed a publicity stunt I mean there's just no question that that's what it is it being promulgated and push by Central American Latin American government being pushed\nBy the government of Mexico which is allowing migrant caravans you traveled toward the United states border\nWhen the president says these are not eligible for asylum is basically correct asylum is where people are being targeted by government is not for economic migrants who simply wants to cross over into the United states in order to take advantage of the economic benefit of living a rich and powerful country bad that it didn't move Asian\nI don't think that the big problem with that is that somebody is going to go and shoot up a congressional baseball game Idaho Bernie Sanders responsible for that\nI think the problem with these sort of radical polarized rhetoric the kind of inflamed rhetoric the problem with that sort of thing is that when something terrible does happen when somebody does something that is truly evil and somebody goes and shoots a synagogue for example\nInstead of a unifying and say all of that as bad\nWe are now more likely to see the other side as responsible for a crime that we all agree is evil the social fabric relies on looking at each other as though we are friends not enemies but if our politics is all about how we are enemies then when something bad happens to be first reaction is to blame it on your enemy\nAnd when that happened to social fabric actually the case that the biggest problem that I see here the only casts on things you write a piece for Bloomberg today and when she says that Trump hateful speech raises the risk of violence\nIt may be one sided focused on President Trump's speech as opposed to the left speech is counterproductive\nIf we want to say let's all take it down it's like I'll take it down a notch ... I agree with but you want to say that Trump is uniquely responsible for the tone and tenor of American political debate right now that's just not accurate it's just not accurate and you know it's not accurate\nI mean which intimate Lee in the last twenty four hours a Republican Party headquarters and blues account in Florida\nThe the windows were shot out here's footage from that\nJust walked in the coming through the back door and they sell the windows and\nNot have time at that point to look around\nAnd then um I didn't realize there was\nGunfire but there's one bullet holes in our windows and therefore bullet holes in the room so\nThe idea that violent rhetoric is only happening on one side is just a lot there's another problem which he just saying that rhetoric is is deeply connected with violent and that is the component to censorship\nSo there is a threat in saying that rhetoric is directly connected with violence here's a threat the threat is that people will then say okay let's restrict the rhetoric best restrict the rhetoric and that the move that's being made in for example Europe is being made 'em right now I'm I'm broadcasting from Vancouver it's a move is being made in Canada\nIn Europe and there's a case has been wildly under undercover in Europe there is an amazing amazing case in which a woman was fine for criticizing the prophet Muhammad hey this is\nThis is the knee description of the case from the Atlantic ram would write a few years ago I appear in alive Egyptian television show hosted by a conservative Muslim jihad sympathies he learned early on by offering to answer any question I had about Islam including he said what is the president ... what what are the prophet Muhammad was a child molester\nThose seemed awfully open minded I talk in the house humorless jihad as tend to be about profit when the lights went up in the program again I mentioned the travel Esther issue has remained true to his word that diversity and to re short chiding me for my apartments around the same time a woman referred to as he asked was convicted in Austria for in effect not raising her identical curiosity in the form of a question\nOn Thursday the European Tour of human rights upheld for two thousand eleven conviction for discouragement of religious precepts\nA crime and Austria the fact well yes did or not in dispute she held seminars in which he presented her view the Mohammed was indeed a child molester\nDonna Islamic traditions hold them on his third wife or you shop was sick at the time of the American nine at a confirmation Mohammed was in his early fifties\nThe offspring woman repeated these claims the Austrian court rules you had to pay four hundred and eighty year old or spend sixty days in jail and the ISI HR ruled Austria and not violated her right\nThis is the consequences of restricting speech because you believe the speech either leads to violence or violence there are consequences on the other side of this equation it's not all about rhetoric and violence are connected there or take down the rhetoric there is a problem with saying rhetoric and violence are connected and therefore we must restrict the rhetoric\nSupposed to be very careful about what it is that we are calling for here\nWe have to be very careful because we're not careful then the impact of that is going to be a lot worse than the actual disease itself in just a second\nI Want to talk about anti Semitism about the media's radical rhetoric we didn't get to all of that in just one second but first let's talk about your underwear due to fall is here as you switch out your wardrobe don't neglect your underwear now is a perfect time to upgrade or restock their drawers with all of all colors in print\nFrom tiny tiny neither do the best underwear in the business Tommy John obsesses over every little detail on stage they use proprietary fabrics to perform like nothing you've ever learned before as a result Tommy John men's and women's\nI mean these are the best underwear in the business Tommy John obsesses over every little detail in ditch\nThese proprietary fabrics to perform like nothing you've ever learned before as a result Tommy John men's and women's underwear spread to know what you're guaranteed what helped me in high school comfortable staple way stands and a range of fabric that are luxurious Lee soft better like moisture wedding\nReasonable designs move with you not against you that means no punching know riding up Tommy John instill confidence in their underwear that if you don't love your ... you know bull refund with their best burial everywhere or it's free guarantee\nSo what do you have to lose that includes their life changing women's underwear which is now fully back and stop before you spend another dime on cheap heat trapping multi packed underway remember there's no better way to take care of your good\nTommy John no just needed hurry over to Tommy John dot com right now is ... ... for twenty percent off your first order as prominent Cuban for twenty percent off only at Tommy John dot com\nI Love it these underwear you will do and again there is no risk because they've got that best Terry level where it's free guaranteed Tommy John dot com\nI Want to talk about the polarization and I'm One of the reasons that lying about the level of of rancor on the other side well whitewashing yourself to a bad idea I have to get right but I have a kid who's four and a half to two and a half\nFour and a half year old is just a wonderful beautiful girl she definitely has a herself the two and a half year old has now decided he's had enough and so he's going to harass or every waking minute of every single day and we as parents have to decide exactly how we're going to treat this\nNow the easy response is it when he pushes her and she screams in his face which is basically\nEvery hour or two in our house right now too I simply put him or punish are also\nThe answer is what I Do as I say to him you need to go aircraft right now right you get a time out you know how to put your sister and I said her Leah when you have a problem I Need you to come and talk to me about it I Need you to I Need you to actually talk man standing right here you don't need to scream and his face there is no authority figure for two to which you can appeal\nAnd screaming in his face or pushing him back is not the proper solution to this I'm now is he more responsible and she has you but of course yeah of course yet right he's pushing her but\nThat doesn't mean that you get to act like rats doesn't get to scream in his face I think it's pushing back and get to do any of those things\nRight now in American politics here's how things are going people unless see themselves as my daughter people on the right to themselves my daughter everybody feels like they are being pushed by the other side and they feel like it's okay to screen back in that person's face nobody is saying yeah I'm being pushed by the other side and that's bad but also I shouldn't screaming anybody's face and push back\nMaybe what I should do instead is appealed to the broader moral authority of the American people and not act like that\nYeah the the media has been saying for a long time President Trump needs to stop saying the press were the enemy of the people that President Trump I got a lot of blowback yesterday tweeted out at President Trump should not say that the media are the enemy of the people a lot of folks on the right to enter the fake news or the enemy of the people I\nWould buy that narrative except that President Trump has never been very clear about what constitutes the fake news now there's some I think is big news by their people who are quote unquote journalists who are actually just opinion makers there\nAre actual headlines that are wrong that stuff is big news but the president has been a blender ... and his use of the term fake news and there's a poll he doesn't like it's fake news and there's a story that he doesn't like it's fake news he's never actually been very good about objectively saying what is big news in what is not so I'm not going to buy that exact excuse\nThe press though they know the president shouldn't say that Trump Trump's and say that the press or the enemy of the people\nThat is true also true the media should not portray President Trump as the enemy of the people which they have been doing literally since the day he was elected and before they say he's a Russian agent they say that he's a traitor to the country\nThey say that he's doing all of this for his own personal enrichment without any evidence to this point\nThey say all of these things and then they think OK well our hands are clean our hands are clean and you can see the sort of attitude you want to know what folks are angry at me on the right to one of the reasons the folks are angry at the media on the right here's Jim Acosta going after Sarah Huckabee Sanders on his basement [laughter]\nIs going to say but fake news radio or the enemy of the people\nWho were just saying there are some journalists them ... hours of this country\nFor the beef a sucker for sure\nYou have the guts [laughter] sure just say we're ... we're we're journalists for the unreal [noise]\nAnd really what you should say is I mean what Trump things is huge of a ... that's what the obviously running through Sarah Huckabee Sanders has had she stuck between a rock and a hard place because at the press secretary or don't want to start labeling people enemy of the people is white from shouldn't be using the phrase\nBut if you're talking about fake news right I mean I think Jim Acosta is is not in the journal is I think just as objectively speaking as I can be I think Jim Acosta loves him some kind of Costa he sees himself as an activist more than a journalist\nAnd it's obvious to everyone CNN then tweeted out or in response to Sarah Huckabee Sanders who said that the debt I'm tired and you can just went after me she said you guys are polarizing the debate because you're suggesting that President Trump is responsible for shootings and bombing\nAnd as you said that the debt I'm terrible when asked me to she said you guys are polarized debate because you're suggesting that President Trump is responsible for shootings and bombing CNN communications said no press secretary\nIn and did not say Donald Trump was directly responsible for the bumps into our office buys ardent than in Bolden support we did say that he as you should understand words matter every single one of them but so far\nYou don't seem to get the cat's ally CNN has been saying for a week for a week at Trump should be taking responsibility for the money I mean I read you the kind of runs like last week for a whole segment and and and then host people like Julie ... is this radical journalists political journalists from GQ\nBecause Jews can actually be outstripped any as your sexual hierarchy by other forms of racism and so the intersection version of it at one anti Semitism it actually to lean more anti Semitism\nBecause what it suggests is if the Jews escape anti Semitism at the Jews succeed in Israel is using seat in the United states that is in effect of them climbing that inter sexual power hierarchy and not leaving behind their membership in the group victim put by in a group victim click\nAnd this is why the ... version of anti Semitism is not only wrong it is actually counterproductive and lead to more anti Semitism and has been mainstream into the Democratic party today understanding anti Semitism is the key to fighting it and I fear that a lot of folks don't actually understand what anti Semitism is or if they do they're ignoring it\nWe'll be back here tomorrow with all of the latest news from low back with regard to presidents on immigration plans all the way to\nDo you what I Would watch WMA a Washington\nThe reality when I was just [noise]\nIt's her massacre rumors right who I man cave [noise] the president and first lady I pay their respects at the Pittsburgh synagogue were eleven worshippers are gone down and visited others who were wounded at a local hospital Pennsylvania attorney general Josh Shapiro says now is not the time for President Trump to come to Pittsburgh\nSadly I think that the president's presence there today\nA and and and those protesters who came out in the street to follow the president's visit distract from the real issue and that is being eleven Pittsburgh or say eleven Pennsylvania the eleven Americans who after being very today and in the days ahead the focus should be on them\nThe president wants to drop the constitutional right to become an American citizen was born in the U.S to illegal immigrants Senator Graham says he will introduce a bill to end birthright citizenship\nHis statement comes after President Trump suggested he would do away with that citizenship processor and executive order and a string of tweets Graham said his legislation will be along the same lines as the proposed executive order one tweet raids finally a president willing to take on this absurd policy of birthright citizenship\nOthers say the president just fanning the flames of anti immigrant sentiment just days before the mid term Lindy Kenya

new book that's available now you can order your uh your ... your your online version and\nYou can a pre order your online version it's war with Russia from ... and then Ukraine to Trump and Russia gate we're dealing with Russia gate right now 'cause it's a week before\nThe midterm election where the allegation goes the Kremlin will once again be in the field to corrupt democracy we're dealing with the ironies of history how in the old Cold War they didn't tell Margaret Thatcher\nThat the Kremlin really had an agent in the election was their opposite number Michael footage labor party and in the new election\nOr they did they the Obama administration their intelligence apparatus their FBI their deal Jay shouted to the rooftops Hillary Clinton shouted that Donald Trump isn't it as a Kremlin agent with no evidence that the world we live in the new Cold War is a ... state and with farcical elements but\nThere is damage here and Steve I Want to begin with legitimacy what does the allegation a week before the midterm do for the legitimacy of the American government\nWhen we talk we talk about the potential and put a implications\nRamifications of this Russia the allegation that the Russians ... the outcome of our elections in the case of Trump in two thousand and sixteen and as you say the media's pushing this now in regard to the house congressional elections\nOn November sick so quickly you and I talked about this a little bit and it is a subject in my book war with Russia this question mark after it and\nThe war I think about this I don't see this going away in the sense that as you said damage is being done we need that\nSince a process so here's what I asked myself and it's it's more a question that an assertion but I think our folks listening ought to think about it\nThere is what I asked myself and it's it's more a question that an assertion but I think our folks listening ought to think about it [noise] um\nIf you say and you say it's for two and a half years\nEven though you can't produce any evidence that the Russians may have put Trump in the White House or what have you done to the institution of the American presidency\nBecause it won't end with Trump because the idea that the Russians could do this the Kremlin could do this and now they're saying the Chinese may want to do it but that a foreign power\nCould choose our president\nBoth ten certainly de legitimize is the presidency is an institution to cast a shadow of wine\nOr let's go to what's going to be the normal reaction the next Democratic president is going to get the same kinds of stuff thrown at him or her that the Democrats have been throwing at Trump it isn't going to end so what we have to ask ourselves is first\nWe get a\nAlmost a daily generalizing of our elections as a process\nBeginning with the presidential one and two sixteen now going into next Tuesday these questions had been raised so I have no doubt that if\nOther Republicans hold the house uh\nWho remain the majority that segment of the Democratic party and its media will be saying that the Russians were behind this or that the Russian to you know tip the scale\nBecause they wanted to protect Trump so would we then have a shadow over the presidency and over\nThe next Congress that's fairly serious in my mind mine John and then that raises another question in my mind\nIf these people take this seriously\nWhat are they saying about American voters\nOf the American people now in democratic theory and you don't have to be a political philosophy notice the bedrock a representative democracy is that the agency\nLies with voters and voters will make a rational a functional democratic decision and you live by their decision you would agree with that I didn't look like a loss for yet to begin with that premise may go on from there to talk about\nInstitutions representative government but you can't have institutions are representative government [noise] ah and less you\nHave people to elect them otherwise and some authoritarian systems\nOutwardly democratic parliament for example correct but there are simply appointed and control\nIt's called managed democracy but a real democracy\nAnd representative democracies the one we know how you need the voters but if the voters are said to be as they are in these Russia gate\nAllegations [noise] forever susceptible to a hundred thousand dollars worth of ads out of about forty billion ads bought or whatever it was a by some\nRussian wacko social media operation in St Petersburg what does that single at the American people\nI mean we got to think this through at about other people you and I John who've lived are higher life inundated by advertising on television that we don't believe for a Mac I mean I Know that if I buy that beautiful car\nIt is not going to get me all the beautiful women that are leaning over the car I mean we have been raised to be\nIntuitively skeptical\nOf the things that come to our attention I think that's fair to say I mean advertising agencies try to manipulate us but we know what's going on so to say that\nThe Russians are capable manipulating American voters is saying something less about the Russians than about our own people but that is what these Russia gate allegations are saying\nIt is striking to me Steve remembering the election and just I was participating as a reporter and I was watching on Twitter I could tell when the Russians were on line because it was morning time in Petersburg so I Would often wish them a very good morning in Russian\nAnd they would never respond because they didn't have a sense of humor they were working for money I understood that but it wasn't a threat it was kind of cheering that they were so keen on trying to influence us with awkward statements like Tennessee for Trump you know that kind of thing right\nFor the very first flight to very thank you very much picked a real hard date there for the Republicans imagine Tennessee So high I it never occurred to me that it would be it would be concocted to be a threat to democracy it seemed\nIt seemed kind of sweet of them that they want to get it that they that they wanted to get in on the process because they don't have anything comparable\nAndme me cause we talked about this I Will go into a store like whatever meddling or ...\nThey don't have anything comparable\nAndme it cause we talked about this I Will go into it but historically whatever meddling or interference the Russians\nDid and to sixteen was part of a long history\nOf ... of let's let's turn to that just moments the predator buyback of meddling in their elections where we'll check when we come back professor Steven up calling the new book is war with Russia question

I mean it's ... stress that this guy if this broken soul down in Florida [noise]\nDecided some were you for some reason to post a story about Syria what are they care about Syria we don't know yet what matters is as he got it out of the New York times Washington Post\nI I Want to ask it Shapes Our media and ... and when\nPeople walk up to me in the street and say Steve\nA is ... I'm going to decide is putting gonna throw the house to the Republicans the Democrats they are carrying and where did they get this they got up in the New York times of the Washington Post or they got it from cable TV which gets their segments from the New York times worse than both that's why it\nMatters that's one of the virtues of the John ... so you are kind of alternative source of news ... news analysis but\nHe only got so many million viewers a\nPool for a big country and a lot of people do believe this stuff not like\nI Want to go to what is to be done with these allegations of one version of what has to be done is censorship\nWe see that underway right now in all directions because the social media sites are acting\nUh intermittently and haphazardly and non transparently to censor or weed out Russian interference there are other things they're doing but where I'm concentrating on Russia right now Russian interference\nHow that actually affect the election I Can't tell you but I Do know it sets up the possibility that whoever loses on Tuesday is going to blame the Russians\nIt also it sets up the possibility that there is never going to be a safe space for elections in America in perpetuity if this if this theme continues tape our elections are always going to be vulnerable we can't shut the door fast enough\nAnd we have to find another way to go forward as the government which means didn't trust the mob trust the leadership that's where we're headed Steve trust the people who know best\n... that's what worries me among other things and that's a theme and a Bible\nAll that whereas this leading up to me and you got to get the language right Russia gave has been an elite project and one of the things I Do in the book is I trace it back to the CIA and Brennan maybe even before to sixteen and the story to the extent that it's\nKnown I put it in the book I don't claim to know at all because you never know everything that the intelligence services do that's why they're called intelligence services I guess but\nThe problem here is is it they set into motion these narratives about what's going on people believe them they were coming to a moment\nAs we know it's a week away where one week away from the election\nAnd these narratives about what's going on people believe them they were coming to a moment\nAs we know it's a week away where one week away from the election and as you say are the losers are going to blame the Russians they will\nWe've already have that in off year elections show where how do we get our elections back\nNow one thing we do you and I talked about it I won't go into it at great length I heard something the other day that reminded me up and we do to broadcast maybe more than one on the long history of American meddling in Russian elections are Russian politics sure\nAnd I cannot fix Nineteen Ninety six we throw money at it\nWhat we could start with Woodrow Wilson who sent troops to ride a bike riding Russian so I ... I mean it's a century long and we've kinda gotten used to it but\nThe problem is we don't recognize as Russia gate phenomena Israeli is rather modern day minor episode in his behavior somebody said the other day I'm not going to say who was because he's very famous\nUh I don't think he's alive ball but he's held a lot of really important positions [noise] he said that we wouldn't know that that he was in the Clinton and the uh\nUh the Clinton Administration [noise] and he remembers that at that time when Yeltsin was up for re election in Nineteen Ninety six right yeah and he was like seven percent in the polls\nSo Washington mounted a big campaign to save you often but the one thing we didn't do this guy said is the main Greivis against ... and was he hadn't paid pensions and two or three years\nAnd we didn't\nHelp them pay pensions\nThat's absolutely not true\nIt's it's a matter of public record Clinton got free Austin and International Monetary fund loan I Can't remember if it was four billion or a billion dollars but it was specifically so Yeltsin could pay pensions and unpaid wages\nAnd that was arranged by that and that was a cold and you'd establishments fact when we talked about food and if the threat of the pensioners said on that make the Kremlin tremble\nIf we think about it that we think about our parents and our grandparents and the rule the Social Security is played by ... played in this country for for for decades and we think about how pensions today or a political subject in the United states and by the way in Russia to uh\nYou could almost I I had a double negative you could not intervene more intimate buddy\nIn another country's\nThan by intervening in the pensions issue and I'm getting I have yes I mean how intimate that is to the survival of families and yet we did it now people might say well it was a good thing that Yeltsin won because the communist would've\nCome back to power it could say that but to deny what we did to have amnesia about our our very intimate intrusion into Russian election and then get all round up by a handful of Russian social media\nOh what a post in American electoral cycle seems to me to be stripped of all of his uh\nUh the we have very dangerous we have to turn to the other elections where the Kremlin is accused of bad acting I'm speaking with professor Stephen F ...

which is mostly based in New Zealand\nUm they were launched from New Zealand they've had to launch attempt to the second was successful they have a very small I could call the electron rocket fault is a company focused on launching small sets cube SATs making the image primary payloads and then she'll go have lunch almost once a week if not more than that\nAnd ah this third launch is tentatively scheduled for November eleventh and they're they're touting that launch as their first commercial operational launch and they already had a bunch of uh a cube SATs satellites payloads signed up for that launch while the news here is they signed up\nAnother company to put two satellites payloads on that law so you're going to have those to put these two satellites plus to all the communication satellites\nPlus an educational cube set plus a drag sale technology demonstrator um and plus another uh what do you call it a optical satellite now that there's a loss of a small satellite she's all small cube SATs on nano sets even small of that and they're sending for November eleventh launch\nThis is it even though the calling operation that's still a test launch in a sense that it's successful they're going to follow up with another a launch in December half that successful I think it's pretty likely that common plenty Nineteen companies can be launching almost weekly with keep sets it can be pretty exciting\nOut from their New Zealand launched side or are they still talking about moving\nYou know they they they're not going to move they talk to a week or so ago they announced that\nThere are also going to launch in addition at some point out of wall of silence the middle and dry a space support that's in Virginia so what will happen eventually as they ought to be launching from both sides on a regular basis this means that can really get a lotta satellite allowed satellites off the\nGround to make some very valuable as a settled satellite companies\nNow the

is the key to this what this rocket his intending is\nIt's going to put a lot of pay load at all but comparable to a Saturn five but that big goal with this rocket is it that we will be completely re usable\nThey thought they could maybe I'm a upgrade the falcon nine and the Falcon Heavy to be completely re usable because they don't use the upper stage but they decided to be better just built from scratch with what they now know\nTend to be as far as two stages of first stage which they know how to use that land that vertically the upper stages kind of like a ... a shuttle is using shuttle concepts as it comes back in the atmosphere uses its body like the shuttle did to shed speed\nSo that it can slow down enough to land but I'm like the shuttle it's not going to land on a runway they're going to use what they already know how to do and that's particularly land it\nAnd what they announced this week is that they're going to do the first top a test of the bill ... big falcon

about who is the real Andrew Gillum here is he the centrist or is he the founder which I found he is of this organization\nAaron how did you how did he how did this happen why wasn't he vetted why didn't he sanitized his background it does I Can't explain this I mean I'm reading some of these statements from their mission he worked on his cell twenty Seventeen he didn't win the nomination

used\nA let's say the far left of the progressive movement in order to build his base and won the ... and win the primary\nAnd he's in a very strange position because he's taking money from them and they're all this group that we're describing here is on the ground now in Florida are trying to get out the vote so I don't think kicking disavow them or even removed the activism given that he's not just too closely associated with them they formed the backbone of his campaign\nIs nonsense this is just nonsense ... there are people in Florida who are Democrats who run newspapers are they reading

I won't read it but is there a radical faction of\nNative Americans that are working who are working for him I mean what is this not is this is the rhetoric of the progressive that doesn't have any connection to reality\nYou know I don't know that it's for Native Americans I can tell you from being on the ground here in America by the way over this last year a and in New York I was actually in I'm In California the bay area just a few weeks ago and here in Florida\nI I've been with the young college age crowd and there is an element that truly believes in this stuff they died I think that's\nOriginal the was targeting now he's trying to balance that uh with this at the base here on the left in Israel which is in Florida which is more to the center and and I do think\nThat that's why this race is so defining if he ends up taking Florida with this radical background ... what that says about the Democrat Party is very telling and also I I Know that somebody like Christians who what Brad mainstream Democrat is\nGoing around with some of these same cast of characters and she's also associating herself with\nThis kind of ideology so it says a lot that the Democratic party as a whole is worrying thing that's often the director him pretty much openly while the media is sort of ignoring the so let's\nSee if he takes Florida and it's just part of why I'm here and why I've been paying so careful attention to Florida to this particular race and this is not just about today this is about the future right the ... party and then also if Trump can carry Florida and twenty twenty\nAaron Klein of Breitbart Jerusalem I'm John bachelor this is the John bachelor show\nOne in five point nine ... ... am six thirty Washington's mall double the run by our elections\nAre infrastructure our governments in the United states has a master hackers to\nThe best one of the CIA cyber age who defies all notions of what a deadly violence\nFormer intelligence agent Eric ... page turning\nThe tables are turned in big power cyberwarfare\nEric ... new novel from done books by\nThe Y.

[laughter] so while there were volunteers into the gas service at no point C O did I get the sense that the volunteers understood their risk and what would happen to them the rest of their

talked about in the press with often\nUh using terms like fighting fire with fire ... it was very little that really describes the um the the actual reality of what it was like to be on a battlefield\nOr with chemical weapons in said there was a little bit of a a kind of gee whiz or a new kind of weapon um and and these soldiers were kind of\nPulled in by the attraction of being on the cutting edge kind of weaponry without honestly\nThe weapon um and and these soldiers were kind of pulled in by the attraction of being on the cutting edge kind of weaponry without honestly like a real understanding of what that actually meant dissect\nMeanwhile back at American University the first effort is defensive they want to develop a gas mask\nThat is useful they can that they can sell or provide to the British and the French remember for a long period of time\nThe U.S has been making a great deal of money on the first war before it gets involved but it's now in the war and they failed at their first gas mask which tells me that despite all the chemistry that they've gathered together they really do not understand the risks the oh\nI think that's true and it was also something else did they did not understand with it you know these are first few a man and they were all men were brought into this effort to create the first gas mask these are scientists their academic\nOr they deal with a theoretical ah problems in question what they don't deal with something like industrial production and so\nWhat they did is they set out to ah create a kind of theoretical that gas mask without really understanding what it would mean to have to make millions and millions of them in at a very very fast paced and do\nThese scientists really had these very inflated expectations of how quickly they could do this and how will they could do it and the very first Mac it was created which was meant to be an American mass\nAs distinct from the French a Mac and the British math\nUm were as you said they they were failures or they failed and a number of ways and it was considered it's a great embarrassment for the soldiers who\nExcuse me for the scientists who are at the top of their fields and some of the top research universities institutions around the country they believe that it should be very easy and it turned out to be much much more difficult than they thought um and it took them a great deal longer to come up with a uh the the first American mask that could actually put in a mass production\nA month September of Seventeen there's a headline in the U.S papers following this story as they have here we go to war us prepared for barbaric the ... on unquote\nWhat the army does is very carefully looked for who can manufacture gases and gas masks and CEOs reporting is exhaustive the Dow Chemical gets involved of course old Barry electro chemical or not now ever falls no longer there American synthetic color company in Stanford Connecticut\nOr they find a proving ground gunpowder neck in the ... and the Chesapeake ... uh Chesapeake Bay\nOr they are setting up a chemical production facilities across the east coast and into the mid west of the United states this is the war department spending money\nBut the whole time the oh I got the sense again that they wanted an American stamp on their gases they didn't just want to imitate the British because if they did they would have just gone completely into mustard gas\nI that's true that's true I'm One of the uh features of the a chemical weapon arms race that essentially the Germans were always one step ahead\nOn and so just when the British and the French had a created a gas mask that would a counter or the new with German gases they would unleash a new weapon and so the uh the the allies the British\nAnd the French and then eventually the American\nUh we're always one step behind the German so the American you're right they wanted to they wanted to find a new weapon they wanted to find something that they could use a that the Germans and their allies did not have a that would be as much of a surprise for the German as the types of weapons that the Germans had been using on the allies [noise]\nUm so yeah the ... immediately it as part of this enterprise at American University and it all the satellite labs all around the United states it was his effort underway to find new kinds of chemical weapons or that hadn't yet been use they\nDo find one that they eventually called Lou a site for the inventor in Illinois campus ... chemists who invented at\nA on American
