market you know change is upon us and\nWe can do nothing and see what happens and we we've seen that happen before and the results weren't so good or we can learn how to evaluate opportunities and be able to shift our focus to take advantage of the opportunities presented to us\nYou know the market is always moving and as a do it yourself investor you know you can allow allow yourself to ride the roller coaster or more importantly you can get yourself out of harm's way and still focus on finding safer and smarter ways to generate income and so\nYou know Craig was involved with the markets for years\nIt's on finding safer and smarter ways to generate income and so\nYou know Craig was involved with the markets for years\nHe knew a little bit about trading right he'd been made made his way for thirty five years in the pits in Chicago\nAnd what he did was he recognized the need to learn a new way of generating income from the market so they'll Craig came to us and he was ... he didn't know what all\nEven though he knew an awful lot\nAnd so for you you probably don't have the same experience that Craig had\nWhich makes it even more important for you to start learning the mechanics of the market and learning how you can start generating safer and smarter returns in the market has do yourself investor and just recognize where we are it's October\nThe market is usually telling us what's gonna happen six months down the line and you know we have some a number of changes that will probably come our way in the near future and so we need to prepare for them\nAnd whether it's the election whether it's the tariffs with China you know there's going to be some major changes coming\nAnd there were a consumer based economy and the yeah the use of tariffs as an assault on consumers and the policies that our government is pursuing is an assault on consumers similar to the same assault we saw from two thousand one to two thousand eight\nWhere you know the price of oil shot up from twenty dollars a barrel to hundred twenty dollars a barrel\nAnd you know we're heading that same direction that interest rates are going up you know we've got a lot of crack showing the foundations\nSo now it's up to us to do something about it\nAnd one of the things I Need to challenge you say you know with the one thing we can count on his change you know the one thing we know that it's going to keep happening is change\nSo how do we educate ourselves to cope with that change and that part of being a ... herself investors be able to recognize the changes in the market so that you can change where your assets are\nGet yourself out of harm's way learn how to protect what you've got\nAnd then start positioning and the way we can start generates safer and smarter returns and so a lot of folks are coming to us with the million dollar portfolios hundred thousand dollar portfolios because they recognize they lost a lot of money in a week ago\nAnd if you if you're not rights while you could lose a whole bunch more\nAnd but we want you to do is get your money out of there\nAnd recognize that being in cash is a valid position\nAnd then you have to do is develop some strategies where you can use your money to generate safer and smarter returns for the rest of your life\nYou know that's what this has become it yourself investors you allow you to do and you know our perspective is that life is it do it yourself project right all the things that you're proud of in life\nYou know your education your career\nYour projects around the house even your family or things that you have done yourself right there was no use or guide but what you did was you know you took it on yourself you took responsibility\nAnd the things that you're most proud of the things that you know bring a smile to your face the things that you know make you feel warm inside are all things you've done yourself\nAnd when you think about your finances that most people don't get that warm feeling right most people's finances don't make them smile most people thinking about their future and their future income prospects don't get that warm feeling\nAnd it's because you've turned over your wellbeing to some stranger\nYou've turned over your future and your financial um opportunities to someone else that doesn't have your interests at heart\nAnd so or even worse they don't have the tools to allow you to generate the income that you need to live the life that you want and the ... effect the legacy that you're trying to have with yourself with your family and your community around you and so\nAs a do it yourself investor you know you just have to recognize that the conventional financial services are not for you\nAnd you've got to find new ways new ways of thinking new ways of acting and be open and coach bull\nMake a change and more importantly in the face of this threat in the face of market volatility in the face of these potential changes to have the motivation to see it through\nStill early in the face of these potential changes to have the motivation to see it through\nTo have the motivation to follow through on you know developing your own personalized approach to the markets\nEvery student that comes to us\nWorks with an education counselor who's focused on helping you identify what it is you're trying to accomplish [noise]\nOnce you figure out what you're trying to accomplish and why that's gonna you know formed the basis for your motivation moving forward and if you've done a financial plan before\nThe financial plan generally assumes that you know you're going to follow the accumulation model and that you have kind of static needs\nWhat we want you to do is recognize you know things are always up and down and so what we want to do is let's plan our financial lives the way the wealthy plan their financial lives you know the wealthiest people in the world the most successful clients I had as a lawyer\nThey all had multiple streams of income generally they have five streams of income so that no matter what life throughout them right maybe they might own a restaurant\nThey might have an interest in another business they might have some interest in the financial contract they might have some rental real estate but generally they each had at least five streams of income\nAnd so for you if you've only got one you've got to start saying why don't I have a second name ... why do I have a third income and rather than that second or third income being being in a ... driver\nWhich is basically a commodity that as a commodity you're able to get less and less for your commitment you know less and less for your effort that you're putting force and develop a unique skill\nAnd develop a unique approach to generate income because there's three basic ways to become wealthy one is you're going to be born wealthy too is you can marry into a wealthy family or three you get a valuable skill\nAnd you earn your wealth\nAnd as a do it yourself investor you've already started like you've built up some capital and but and you probably are wealthy you're probably one of the wealthiest people in the world probably the top ten percent of wealthy people in the world\nHowever you don't feel wealthy because those assets are being productive for you know those assets aren't generating the income that you need to and as you start shifting your mindset\nFrom you know being a retail person with a job and are looking at yourself like a business and start making businesslike decisions with your finances then you can say you know what\nWhy on earth would I invested in the business of getting me you know zero percent return\nReal estate good relocation nation dot com now for that when I get back to see how well your mortgage interest deduction stacks up compared to the rest of the country right here on real estate now [noise]\nIf\nYou're the one in your family that's always checking the value of your home on line you just love real estate you love to hear about the law financing investment market timing economics in more than I Want you to join me hey I'm Eric Stewart host of plenty you home every Sunday Morning here

I. mail\nYou can listen then or listen on our podcast and Eric Stewart group dot com that's Eric steward group dot com and I look forward to seeing you Sunday Morning eight o'clock right here on WBAI mail\nIt really dates with Harris doors [noise]\nSo we know what happened in the last couple of weeks with the stock market there was a massive correction that took place in very short term eight hundred point drop on a Wednesday a couple of weeks ago and there was a third pick biggest point drop of the year and the biggest since back in February\nSo uh as far as that sell off is concerned uh there's a guy who's the chief economist at window to real estate named Matt gardener\nHe said to him in a which is a ... reporting agency it's been my position for a while that the equity markets are over bought and we're due for pulled back\nBut as he points out mortgage rates are connected to the yield on ten year treasury bonds and normally a stock market sell off will drive people into bonds\nWhich actually will reduce the yields however that isn't the case right now we didn't see the bond market actually improve and therefore rates drop as a result of this people pulled their money out equities and didn't buy bonds there was\nIs right now we didn't see the bond market actually improve and therefore rates drop as a result of this people pulled their money out of equities and didn't buy bonds there wasn't a fear of the economy is failing there was confidence that the economy is growing but there's a concern that adds it's growing\nThat there are chances of a recession happening or in certain sides of the economy this will\nThis will effect long term it will affect bonds unless there's inflation so there's some there's a conundrum in place right now we noticed that inflation didn't really kick into gear so some of the concern about inflation rearing its head and driving asset prices higher isn't a concern\nWhat the president has done is actually introduced terrorists to Chinese products that are coming in and if you don't know this we import four times as many products as we sell to the Chinese\nSo if we were to put in twenty five percent levy on the Chinese products and they put a twenty five percent a levee on everything that we sent out to them they're going to be four times as affected as we will\nThat said this is one way actually to cause there to be a slow in a slowing economy is you increase asset prices\nUh unnaturally by putting a tariff which brings in tax dollars to the federal government\nIt actually makes the products have to sell for more or you have to change the chain of where you're buying products instead of buying from China because it costs more you might buy from Vietnam you might buy from Thailand or some other a country where we're proud of his produced\nLawrence Yun chief economist at the national association of realtors [noise]\nUh he he really feels like a ... the impact is really gonna be minimal from the stock market correction\nA certain markets that depend on the success of large tech companies such as Amazon or Amazon stock dropped could make it tougher for those who rely on the company's stock in order to buy a house you know it may make it more difficult\nBut remember this Amazon stock is still even if it's not a bit over two thousand dollars a share it's still up massively\nAs a result if you owned a thousand shares of of Amazon if you bought a thousand shares of Amazon back in uh in two thousand and uh and and nine at the bottom of the market at seven dollars a share a thousand so seven thousand dollars invested\nOkay would be worse one point seven million dollars\nThat say dramatic demonstration of the power of investing in quality companies and how can change your wherewithal look for good companies invest wise [noise]\nYou know what comes to mortgage interest deduction is that our country even or places like Hawaii and New York and Connecticut [noise] uh\nPlaces where the tax bills are so high where the amount that you pay in taxes you can only write off up to ten thousand what what is the mortgage interest deduction\nWell mortgage interest deduction is seven hundred and fifty thousand dollars on any property that is purchased after December of two thousand and Seventeen okay\nAnd that exact date you'll have to check with your account and about that but essentially prior to that you could write off up to a million dollars in\nA in interest on your mortgage now it's seven fifty and that's a combination of a first and second home so if you own two homes first and second home and they equal more than a million dollars you can only write off up to a million dollars total\nI bought a second home back in two thousand and five as it turns out it just was in practical for us to use it as much as I'd hoped\nAnd as a result we turned it into a rental property\nIf you own a second home and you're currently pain tax on the interest because you can only write off a certain amount of money you might want to think about renting your property out for more than Fifteen days a year\nAt that point you may be able to write off the interest on that second property as will no longer be a second home for you if you use it more than Fifteen days it's a little different talk to your accountant again [noise]\nDone a home inspection on a purchase\nSome questions that you might want to ask the home inspector after the home inspection is complete\nNumber one I don't understand what does that mean [laughter]\nThat seems so basic but oftentimes buyers don't just ask the obvious question it's a little bit like being in high school and not wanting to be thought of a silly\nIf you think about asking a question 'cause you don't understand the wisdom says seek wisdom seek understanding\nAsks the home inspector is what you're telling me a major problem or minor problem a lot of times homeless factors will inflame a problem that really doesn't exist they'll cause worry and concern in ways that don't need to be raised so think about the problems that you might find at a property\nReally doesn't exist they'll cause worry and concern in ways that don't need to be raised so think about the problems that you might find at a property and make sure that they're either minor problems or major problems by asking should I call in another expert for follow up inspection\nI told the story about a garage floored that had settled in the middle [noise]\nWe did and inspection with an engineer to decide that in fact the construction of the garage was fine it's just the four was poured over an from soil so all that had to be at it was a fresh pad their basically pouring concrete over the existing settled pad in the garage\nThat report that we got from an engineer gave our client the confidence to move forward with that report and the ability to turn around and sell the property with a clear conscience [noise]\nIs there anything I'll need to do once I Move in is also an excellent question you might want to think about now before you moved in if there's something that you really should do now major
