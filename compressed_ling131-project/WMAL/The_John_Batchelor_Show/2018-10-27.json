existed him it will continue after is gone and the media provide\nSo let's say for example Katie Katie ... over at MSNBC obviously a member of the left and came to her was reminded by I guess it out some of the violent rhetoric used by Democrats and recently she didn't like it wasn't willing to talk about it because obviously only one side of the political ... bad and volatile and used overheated rhetoric\nDue to the air or whatever and they said was the route and other ... other than Donald Trump say I'm so\nProud or or or or or or give kudos to another politician who body slammed reporter have you ever heard that from anyone else other than Donald Trump\nAnd the answer is no it's terrible\nRight now it's terrible when President Trump says that also is terrible and Democrats say that you should pick people when they said he should confront people in public places when Bernie Sanders claims that Republicans are going to kill millions of people with their health care plan to pretend\nThat the volatile political climate the United states than anything it was ridiculous but this has been a long standing democratic tactic for legitimately decade this actually is dangerous for the country for two reasons\nWhat a dangerous about meetings take on this is when they suggest that rhetoric that does not incite violence is responsible for violence there criminalizing rhetoric\nAnd when they do it for only one side it appears that they only want to criminalize rhetoric on one side which leads people to believe that they are coming for you\nAnd to fail to acknowledge this has to fail to acknowledge what's driving a lot of our politics these days which is a reactionary feel that the other side is threatening you\nAnd it's present on both sides now let's get to the right wing response to all of this preemptively so there are people on the right I think most people on the right who said listen we need to wait for more information here we don't know who did this the most likely outcome is crazy person and I said that's\nRepeatedly I said if you think this is a false wide attacking the jump to the conclusions falls flat attack based on nothing but confirmation bias you're doing it wrong there was a substantial sums frat I'm On the right that's ingested that they had to be a Democrat it had to be somebody on the left who perpetrated this because obviously it was convenient for Democrats in the run up to the election\nThis sort of conspiracy the arising is not good either the reason that it is not that either is because it allows people to believe that there are no crazies on their own side that evil is entirely relegated to people who disagree with them it leads to more polarization\nAnd again it's not good for the country when he would jump to conclusions based on your own confirmation bias and right now there's tremendous incentive to do just that\nThere's no incentive for people to say let's wait for more information let's wait from our information is one of the least popular sentences in American politics and it's usually right it's almost always right\nBut it's the least popular phrase because if you come to a conclusion and then jump ends up being right your side says how back I guess if you know how you know you gotta take because it was right and he gets it and if you're on your own side as well that was right it's just the fact that his ... in this case but he still knows what\nIt's like helping the conclusion being incentivize on every side right now and it's really bad\nAnd it's particularly that when the president of the United states has its own legitimately legitimately just a couple of hours before the FBI arrested the stuff that President Trump started tweeting about the ... It's MORNING so he pointed out about CNN plenty has any of the ... and others can criticize it will\nEven blaming made for the current state of bonds and ridiculous like comparing this to September eleventh and the Oklahoma City bombing it when it criticized\nWhen it could attack then they go out and playing chess not presidential he's right about that one that President Trump is correct about that one when he says the media rent him and the corn attachment well and when he worked when he responds they like the timber eleventh or Oklahoma City\nAnd he's and he's creating that he's not wrong about that but here's what President Trump does do wrong they can't just stop their\nWhen they were really looking for economic opportunity she'll go home and apply the right way I don't think there's anything wrong with Trump's and go home and apply the right way but if the idea that it's illegal for them to approach the southern border and apply for asylum that of course is not true either what is also not true is that the United states has an obligation to take an everyone who wants to cross the border and no matter what\nWhere they come from or what their motivation as John Case that gets back and he says that God he he's spoken to God\nThat as a religious person whose piece of God three times a day doesn't talk back to me but I talking to a fairly often like a lot okay but apparently got does talk to John ...\nAnd it's funny have less of a mock Mike Pence when he says that he has to prey on things in order to make a decision on John cases mouthing weapons platitudes and the name of God that is totally fine here's John casing suggesting that God doesn't want us imposing the caravan\nAnd let's stop putting up walls around ourselves and not understanding the place the trouble and the problems of others is law right and the war doesn't want it and our people ask their hearts wants to reach out to others look at what they do in these storms they go in a real people they don't know they put\nThem in their homes they feed him some mirrored model loosely garbage should this division and yelling and screaming and hatred on all sides\nOkay well it is also true that why does America is maintaining a border so there's that as well but even John ... the guy who's gonna bring us all together can't stop themselves from using this sort of overheated rhetoric\nIt's at the ... okay so meanwhile speaking of overheated rhetoric Megan Kelly is going to be out at NBC\nOr she's out at NBC because they are basically fitting about Megan Kelly being racist so this was sort of predictable making how he was not getting good ratings in mourning and so they decided they wanted to dump her and then they found an excuse to dump her when she said I'm a morning show\nThat she didn't see what was wrong with people darkening their skin for Halloween costumes they accused of being pro blackface as we've discussed over the last couple of days this was sheer absolute nonsense we'll talk about the media's attempt to polarize the culture on the issue of race\nBut first let's talk about your online data security with all the recent news about online security breach has had a hard not to worry about where my data goes making an online purchase or simply accessing your email\nCould what your private information at risk you're being trapped on line by social media sites marketing companies are mobile or Internet provider which is why I decided to take back my privacy by using express VPN expressed VPN has easy to use apps that runs seamlessly in the background of my computer phone and tablet turning on express again protection really takes a quick\nExpressed VPN secure as an anonymous as my Internet browsing bankrupting my data hiding by public IP address and protecting yourself with expressed begin costs less than seven bucks a month\nAt first the PIN is rated number one VPN service by tech radar that for a reason if you don't want to hand over your online history to\nTheir Internet provider or data reseller is a threat to the skin is the answer go check it out right now expressed VPN dot com slash then find out how you can get three months for free what's on your package that's expressive VPN dot com slash then X.

I Am ...\nIs it this time we met and take responsibility for our role and the problem of violence against women\nHe said that all men are guilty of violence against women\nHe says I decided not to cut corners joined me with due diligence in civic duty and publicly proclaiming I Am ...\nIn fact perhaps at a time we lay claim to a movement I Am sex and think about national international implications as we take responsibility for sexism or massaging are patriarchy\nIt's hard to admit we're sexist I for instance would like to think that I possess genuine ... bona fide bona fide he's but who am I kidding I'm a failed and broken feminist for pointedly I in fact is there are times when I fear for the loss of my own entitlement to the male toxic masculinity take many forms all forms continue to her and to violate women\nFor example before I got married I insisted my wife take my last name after all she wants to become my wife\nSo why not take my name and become part of me she refused\nShe wants to keep her own last name I was not happy especially as she had her father's last name which I argued contradicted her position against patriarchy but as she argued this is my name and is part of my identity I became stubborn and interpreted her decision as evidence of a lack of full commitment to me well she brilliantly propose that we both change her last name and take on a new name together showing our commitment to each other\nYes obviously the guy's a real anti feminist ... says if you're a woman reading as I have failed you mean it's like a male was forced apology\nIs it sounds like a POW tape\nThrough my silent and an aunt interrogated collective massaging I have failed you I'd help and continue to help perpetuates that 'cause I Know about how we hold on to forms of power that these human eyes you only to elevate our sense of masculinity I recognized my silence as an act of violence it for this I sincerely apologize\nThen really what he's doing is he saying I'm not a success because I'm apologizing for my sexism but every other male is the fact is\nIs that super heating the rhetoric that polarizing our society maybe just a little bit and let's point out the media topography when it comes to these sorts of issues when it comes to these sorts of issues every democratic mail is considered a non Texas in reality\nWhen it comes to when it comes to the media Megan Kelly happens to be a person right of center a Jimmy Kimmel is a personal left or center has anyone brought up the fact that if we're gonna talk about lack basic Jimmy Kimmel into thousands of an actual black face routine on national television on Comedy Central Jimmy Kimmel in in blackface not only\nMocking black people he's among Carl Malone specifically mocking Carl Malone for not being able to speak English properly there's a lot closer to insulting black people and making Kelly saying I don't mind if someone dresses up and dark and their skin is Diana Ross the honors Ayanna raw

reason why people to buy earlier in all honesty all over\nOver\nIs that\nA problem [laughter] fairly that wasn't a problem for Jimmy Kimmel but it's a serious problem for Megan Kelly just adjusted dressing up as a black person to honor a black person or is is not that bad she actually have to lose her job over it\nBy day they're going to pay her out but you have to lose your job over again\nHe polarizing environment predated President Trump will it will go far beyond President Trump because that is the that is the nature of the politics that we have chosen\nAnd it's the nature of the

but honestly ridiculous references like this is my favorite just because I happen to know something about that she talked about Jewish botch the ancient Jewish rabbinical code notice it to separate the apple sometimes treating people who had male and female part as women they could not inherent property or service priest at other times men\nWell ... noted that the stepped up for example sometimes treating people who had male and female part as women they could not inherent property or service free at other times men preventing them from shaving or being to Clinton with women so supposedly this means that it was a third gender\nNo adult okay someone who actually knows this stuff I Will tell you exactly what the Jewish while I was doing the while I was saying this person has to\nSeparate set of general we don't know whether they're male or female therefore we're going to be as ... as possible in every circumstance so we'll treat them as female for purposes of forbidding

the war\nHe presented the story of fugitive slaves and the struggle for America's soul from the revolution to the civil war this is a a historical analogy if it works and Michael is identified the the

forcing those in between to choose so that they're destroying the middle there discouraging the middle [noise]\nWhat is lost when that happens well dunk or things of that and I want to read a passage that he's sites in his introduction this is from Richard hostile to the story and\nHe wrote this up in Nineteen sixty eight during the year fifty years ago when the U.S was pulling itself apart\nOver the Vietnam War over civil rights over violence in Europe over the Cold War pulling itself apart and ... wrote about the loss of comedy that is a concern for ... bunk ... that was a concern in the Eighteenth fifties and Michael and I talk about it because that means there is no center\nWhen it comes down to according to offset or is this comedy exist in a society that to the degree that those enlisted in its contending interests have a basic minimal regard for each other\nOne part of your interests seeks the defeat of an opposing interest on matters of policy\nBut at the same time seeks to avoid crushing the opposition denying the legitimacy of its existence or its values or inflicting upon it extreme and gratuitous humiliation beyond the substance of the games that are being thought\nThe basic humanity of the opposition is not forgotten stability is not abandon the sense that a community life must be carried on after the issues of the moment have been fought over and one is seldom\nAnd in the sense that our community life must be carried on after the issues of the moment have been fought over and one is seldom very far out of mind and awareness to the opposition will someday be the government is always present repeat an awareness of the opposition will someday be the government is always present\nThe reality in value of comedy can be best appreciate it when we contemplated society in which is almost completely lacking Michael that's a warning hopped on a road in Nineteen sixty eight we know that at some point\nThe alienation that we experience today started there in the Vietnam War we know that we live for we were young men\nIt's wonderful and important that those sentiments should come from a Richard ...\nA because Richard hopes that it was writing a in the Nineteen sixties in in ... before Vietnam or the fifties and sixties in the last period of a after glow of World War two that created\nThe longest lasting\nUp period not simply of comics comedy but by the sense of national kinship\nAnd unity that that then began to the phrase slowly with Vietnam and has unraveled to the point where it is today much like the ... before the civil war but hawks Tatar was riding from a period where both\nBoth of elites in America you know bright who left to that extent we're\nWe're committed to the same larger vision and uh to each other\nA ... there's no getting around it and today the opposite is true and what's really important and dumped go I'm In in in all of his writing about a abolitionists and the civil war that\nUnderscores the fact that the abolition is considered terrorists some to be necessary if only to break the never ending gradually lose some of goods and met\nA quote in his book company\nBecause they meant Roy the opposition not on the basis of policy but physically destroy so that the opposition would never be the government that's what they meant to do\nExactly and it it it because as I'm as radical a profit seeking to expunged what is April\n... funding of evil is the destruction of fat author or elite party which is no longer fraternal but now the devil incarnate and what this does which is exactly what happened in the Eighteen fifty is that\nThere's um a\nClear and uh you know unvarnished a declaration that we're out to\nTo do to reform you and make you submit and if you refuse it will be expunged is exactly what drove the south to\nThe intense aggressiveness that they exhibited in the Eighteen fifty it's not just the fugitive slave act but all of the ... of terrorism and and and the like\nYou can always

[noise]\n... about a week or two ago the New York times had a front page report about how Jared Kushner had not paid any taxes in the past five or six years and [noise] you know it was kind of referring you know in ... you know what kind of sketchy deals is he doing where he's\nCheating the government out of taxes and that that's just not the case I mean whether or not you agree with with Jared Kushner is politics or not um she did not paying taxes because he took advantage of certain incentives and the tax on set up that have been around for a while that I think a lot of business owners need to understand as well ... and the real estate property business\nHe buys buildings in rehab damned renovate them and rents them out there are some specific depreciation allowances that are allowed for businesses like him so he can take some up front deductions\nThat that offset any income that might be coming in business owners themselves have the availability to take some significant deductions on capital equipment\nThat they buy from many case up to a million dollars a year John and if you're a business owner and you want to buy equipment like Jared 'cause you don't necessarily have to pay for it you can put a down payment you can finance the arrest as long as you put that equipment or that property him to service you can take a big tax deduction for Cushing who did this\nTo the extent where there's the ... were even exceeded as income and then he was able to carry forward there's losses or even carry them back as well so everything he did was\nCompletely legal and above board and not only that it's good tax strategy a business owners themselves should be paying attention to that kind of tax strategy making investments like that\nAnd capital equipment property taking the tax deduction I think it's a very very good you know strong business moving I Hope that are a lot of accountants are making those recommendations to their clients\nDid the tax cuts and jobs active twenty Seventeen make this even more attractive as you can because this is the first year we discovered that\nIt did so these these deductions\nI've I've been in place for a while I mean the big one that a lot of business owners needs to be aware of its called section one Seventy nine deduction just ask your account and about that that deduction year after year I'm is kind of up for whether or not it was going to be renewed ball and the taxi format\nNot only was it made permanent but it was increased from like five hundred thousand dollars up to a million dollars that businesses can take as a as an accelerated depreciation to touch and\nNot only that and the tax reform act the act at allowed an added more deductions for certain business used vehicles trucks in your business as well that didn't exist before\nSo these are all things that are there and you and I are talking about this now it's late October there is still time left in the year business owners that you can you can make investments in capital of the equipment you can get them finance put him into service before the end of the year and take a significant tax deduction while doing that and why not\nWhat the number again Jane\nYou can the section in the Irish code is one Seventy nine one section one Seventy nine you want to ask her account about\nTrade war we are\nPuzzled as to where it is and where or when it's going to visit our house so trade for\nThe dispute with Canada as you mentioned in Mexico looks to be moving toward resolution the dispute with Europe\nHas not has not at this point crashed anybody's economy and Europe is talking but this dispute with China as I indicated is going to drag on does this worry small businesses because they're worried about the macro economy or can they see this in their prices\nWell there is that there there were a lot of impacts on small businesses most small businesses themselves um or not to ... affected by the trade war but their indirectly affected by the trade war and\nThere are large companies like Ford who announced approximately twenty thousand employees that are going to be laid off\nBecause of increasing costs and Harley Davidson that's moving operations to ah you know other countries that side of the U.S to avoid ah the terrorists that they would have to pay and\nCompanies like three am and caterpillar that are facing increased costs on on some of the corn materials that they buy 'em and also some of the markets that they might be losing because\nYemen caterpillar that are facing increased costs on on some of the corn materials that they buy 'em and also some of the markets that they might be losing because of the war that's going on right now and it is a war with China that\nIs an indirect impact on on small small contractors\nSuppliers vendors that that work up to those larger companies and then of course there's the consumer effect there is you know the most recent round of tariffs do affect electronics and consumer goods that are being sold by the Wal Marts and the targets of the world and that you know filters down to consumers who\nFor many you know our our customers of small businesses and\nIf they're paying more there are willing to take away some disposable income that they could be spending this holiday season a at a small merchants are or restaurants\nSo it does have that impacts right now like you said things are pretty much resolved with Canada and Mexico to be aware you know all the legislature still have to approve this right\nSo that's still up in the air depending on how the midterms go Europe right now we're sort of a truce so discussions continue on with China like you mentioned before is the big thing I\nI was at a meeting of small a bunch of small manufacturers just this week in Minneapolis and some of them were saying that all of this you know if you ... yelling and screaming between the Chinese and and the American counterparts\nIs all coming down to Trump and president gee\nI'm meeting in November and I am one guy stood up and said you know what I understand but Trump is doing when I have a big agreement that I'm going to make with a significant supplier I Want to meet that person face to face and work it out with him I don't need my sales guys are representatives doing it on my part\nAnd some people think that that's what Trump strategy is that that's a lot of bravado and all building up to the big deal that ah that that the two of them are going to are going to make in in November um doesn't sound like you're as optimistic about that happening\nI Know I'm not however I\nDo have a positive peer to end this the macro consumers are spending gene ending spending and spending the wall Street Journal notes that the consumer spending is powered by all the jobs and the really good jobs and that means a good Christmas season and that's what we care about right now\nAgreed agreed and you know I think that the president now at ... we've heard that GDP um you know as potentially impacted by a trade issues with China but John I mean right now GDP is growing and like you said consumers are spending in the economy is strong and\nUh you know maybe from the president's perspective is like if I'm if we're going to fix this issue with China\nAn issue that so many of my clients have been complaining about for years\nWhy not do it now when we're in

on board about two weeks ago and uh they therefore they've had to do a lot of investigations about why that happened bought\nA this week they successfully launched\nA show or use rocket launching military satellite or out of that plus a large size space part in the middle of the country and what that means is that they now are confident they can down the issues with the Saudis rocket\nNow there's a variety so he was rockets but all of them generally use the same first and second stage configurations which is what was the problem on that first launch that bad launched two weeks ago the changes or the third stage or they do use various different stages and so\nThis launch was a success and it does indicate that they're getting closer to solving the problem\nIt's Warren pointed that they wanted to do a variety of unmanned test launches with the soy use to make sure they've got things right\nAnd this is one of them that got at least two more before the man's flying December that means I assess is almost certainly not going to end up having to be evacuated unmanned John there'll be able to get the manned launch in December off on time\nThe report also had an interesting detail about the investigation into the fair yeah we thought that there was a collusion between the strap on second stages and leak law first stage of the solar use a there was some speculation that one of the foul vented valves that's supposed to help push that strap on away did not work\nBut new reporting suggests that the ... that the booster itself the strap on itself was installed incorrectly one that was assembled and they forced a mounting log\nIn that ... out of shape in the process that's what I've got here think of the logs on your car I'm the king me is similar nominally occurred\nOr an unmanned launch in eighty six and to my mind that's a little puzzling if you find you got a problem that how you assembled this shouldn't be redesigned the engineering so it won't happen again [laughter]\nI Can't answer that that's just a question\nTry Bob what a star liner\nCell line it was one of the two commercial capsules that are that are being built by two different companies to provide us access diet says without depending on this all use Russian rocket it's being built by a Boeing they're going to use you LA's atlas five rocket to launch it\nAnd the first unmanned test flight of style line it's tentatively scheduled no early then march while the good news here's the atlas five upper stage the sentence upper stage has now been delivered um\nTo Florida it's came by barge but it is arrived and so they're beginning the assembly process of the actual rocket that will long stalled liner sometime early in the first quarter of next year we help\nBlue hardships knew Glen we worried about do Glenn 'cause they've delayed it Bob ... any more concerns\nWell I don't know if this is actually a positive piece a story a blue arch in just like the atlas five\nUh upper stages delivered to Florida um they are now delivered to Florida blue origin ship that's going to be used as a landing platform for new glands first stages new Glen is their orbital rocket that supposedly going to have built by twenty twenty with its first launch twenty Twenty one I'm\nA and this is going to be like ... nine in the first stages will land on a ball on this ship\n'em what's a little different is the ship we'll be moving when it picks the when it picks it up I'm not sure why they're doing that but that's what they say but either way it's been delivered to Florida and they're going to do work on it and there's the article doesn't run as much information I linked to\nOther than that it's going to be a much bigger public announcement in about a week so we'll have to wait to see what that means [laughter] but it doesn't mean that blue are just moving\nForward on its new Glenn orbital rocket John I'm going to see it so\nGreat for us Bob base for do I get my uniform a patch or any merchandise at all of the Trump people read it\nUnfold on its new Glenn Little Rock shot him could achieve shelf\nSpace for us Bob based force do I get my uniform a patch or any merchandise at all of the Trump people ready to send them out\nBut we only got a few seconds but my impression is that moving forward with it and we'll just see how much ruin dug all this has got to be caught in the coming\nYears I Want my space for uniform Bob ... I Want to be a lieutenant colonel by the way it's anybody's listening Bob Democrat\nHe keeps the website behind the black on John bachelor this that the John bachelor show [noise]\n\n\n\nUm but I think a lot of people are just hoping that uh\nThat um you know in terms of orders of magnitude he'll get closer to market economics then obviously the P. T. is even if he does make you know you can do the full Monty\nSecurity uh I Do I have never traveled to Brazil but I read anecdotes to say that the streets of the large cities can be dangerous because of abduction dangerous for the well to do does ball so narrow speak to that is what he says credible\n[noise] well first of all I Would say that most of the danger and we talk about danger I think like with respect to homicides most of that occurs in poor neighborhoods and the\nThe major victims of the high a homicide rates are um the poor\nI mean they're the ones who are killed in these bad neighborhoods and that is why I'm despite the fact that he's been accused of being a racist and so forth bomb and he does have some support not huge um\nBut he has some support or some significant for it I Would say from um people in those neighborhoods\n[noise] um I'm a little bit skeptical as to whether he can I'm actually make a big dead in crime I mean part of the problem is is this is organized crime and it's funded by uh the drug habits of wealthy Brazilians and wealthy Europeans and an American who\nBy drugs or you know through the supply chain but eventually\nThese are the people who are supplying them so um those people have a lot to lose their very well armed\nUm I think it might be very difficult for him to dismantle those organized crime groups not like nobody has ever tried before I'm having said that I think he's going to do some very simple basic things\nTo try to get on the side of the police\nI'm In a way that the government has not been the problem is that the police have basically withdrawn their presence is not there in some of these\nAre tough neighborhoods they've given up this territory and one of the reasons is because the civilian government has not are stuck with them when they get into trouble um so they're not they don't have enough weapons and for example if you're a police\nAnd you shoot somebody and one of these neighborhoods basically immediately there's an investigation against you and and you're you're pretty much considered guilty until you improve yourself in a sense\nUm which you know he sort of saying you know if you're in one of these neighborhoods and you shoot someone there should be an investigation to see it you should be prosecuted or not there should be you know you should get the benefit of the doubt you should be\n... you should be able to say I'm innocent until proven guilty like any other citizen would be and you know\nI think that this reminds me a little bit of what are we they did in Columbia\nWhich is basically to to get on the same side as the military and say I will defend you in your in your work against these criminal organizations and of course ... did not to defeat those organizations but he did reclaim\nUm the territory for the state he re establish a presence of the state so that's possible and that's basically what both ... says he's going to do\nThere is the possibility of the other candidate in the runoff is that a dog the man from Sao paolo\nYes it is and um that possibility still exists I mean I'm I'm not a ready to say that he cannot when I'm a big part of it will come down to turn out [noise]\nAnd um I think you know the sense is that a lot of his constituents\nUm there was a very poor they're the ones who depend on you know basically state entitlements and so forth and the sense I get from reading the polls is that those people feel like I'm really that\nEight entitlements and so forth and we sent they get from reading the polls that
