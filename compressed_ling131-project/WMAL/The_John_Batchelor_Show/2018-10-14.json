the\nBy John Solomon over at the hill who's the opinion editor for they don't also video over there and he joins us now\nHe made a lot to talk about thanks for joining us out of the well the first is of course the president had that a flight with Rod Rosenstein yesterday I hadn't done to Orlando and everything seems to be hunky dory\nA but your reporting suggested this whole idea of wearing a wire recording the president and getting them caught in the twenty Fifth Amendment situation uh there were some people who are dead serious about that over the FBI yeah\nI think so certainly are the ... the I call them will push for that conversation thought so and so those are my column today it was last week so to speak with us one of the general counsel the FBI\nA ... interview with Congress Mark Meadows ... remembers the house oversight committee each and a during that interview Baker said hey there was no joking about this uh this conversation it may twenty Seventeen or it's real it was serious we were seriously talking about wearing a wire\nAnd recording the president and taking that information to the cabinet and hopes that we can get him removed from Congress so and his source of that information was he had talked directly to the acting FBI Director ... former deputy director Andrew McCabe and to Lisa Page capes\nA lawyer at the FBI support of bakers\nAnd as we know these pages also famous for her text messages or with Pete stroke the or Russia lead agent ... lead agent yeah but uh by his account everybody yeah yeah I thought this was a serious matter that local area so\nIf you think about it is dropping the FBI whose job is investigate crimes is now trying to get involved in an effort to remove the president a it's a it's really remarkable\nNow I just want to be clear on this because a lot of people are taking your story John to interpret that a that a Rod Rosenstein is lying when he says it was just a joke that he really is a problem yet he may have been joking right\nBut ... your own no right to your story says that McCabe and those guys at the FBI they weren't joking about that they weren't there were serious about\nIt so at least the people in the room walked away with a serious in France if this was something they should consider doing\nOne of those awkward moments where you might make a sarcastic joke at a table and everyone looks at using oh is that something can we really do that\nYeah no that's right we don't know and and we should give you the benefit of about weight justify the eleventh\nHour should be on a later this week on Thursday the ... so the real question is uh what is his account what does he take of it did he ever tell the FBI you shouldn't be talking about that staff who brought the idea of a there's a lot of things that we don't know about I think most importantly though\nThe Congress was hoping to get on by October fourth and fifth answer their interviewer roses team\nOr the Cape and other member that that reference this meeting that they've awarded alive this conversation about recording the president\nAnd the Justice Department has yet to turn those documents over so we've seen this pattern many times that Congress wants documents justice at all they do an interview then they turn over documents later and you find that there were things you wish you knew what documents before he did\nYeah and speaking of all those FBI documents you know one thing that we've all noticed is these ... were told that releasing any\nAny documents would jeopardize national security jeopardize the FBI and how they go about doing their business in their sources and methods and then then when we finally get the ... that's not the case at all and and you found in your article two days ago I was a little bit of a paper trail here that suggest that this is all politics but yeah\nCertainly certainly the reaction I found there is no national security reason whatsoever mission\nYeah well a little bit of a paper trail here that suggest that this is all politics\nYeah certainly certainly the reaction I found there is no national security reason whatsoever this involves a another thing that James Baker told Congress last week which is that\nYeah during the height of the Russia investigation a few weeks before the end of the election or they were going for the price of ward member of President Trump and Hillary Clinton are competing against each other they're going to go get advice of weren't based on the political opposition research paid for by the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton yup uh\nOkay

I'm going out for free to Brazil or we're not seeing you order a psych exam\nAnd they helped me in the county six months and like I said I'm sitting here at the crime it's like I Want to Chicago I

done uh and and I\nDo wish you well I'm ... and decided to scale morality uh I think you're dealing with some very amoral individuals I Would say that if we're talking about the scale of one to tend the folks that you are dealing with probably starting out around the a three and so I don't like your chances of ever getting very far with those folks but uh hey ah you know if for now\nWe're going to try to find those folks who are at least at least you know five six is on our overall sliding scale morality which by the way if you missed it at the onset of the show it's kind of my theme that I'm tying things into today\nI like to say there are two sides to stories one side effects and you have the premise of the premise of anything is faulty built upon it will fail to but they're also it was a sliding scale of morality and so we're on it\nWe exist and where we're at or best maybe we're good people where we're at our worst maybe we're not quite as good but the differences are we've somebody who will end up hurting others what we see in today's world we got a lot of folks that are willing to hurt others and we have a whole political party right now that is willing to do that as well\nAnd a lot of that happen through misinformation so let's talk about the employment situation again for a second record low unemployment for minorities black\nUnemployment rate at all time lapse\nAnd somewhere along the way you have Donald Trump that brings out the best and many of these minority communities you have somebody who actually sat down with Kim ... which many of us were skeptical about at the onset and something constructive came out of it\nNow you have Kanye West who goes into the oval office and\nSomething constructive might come out of it\nBut more to the point the more open minds we have in this country the better the employment picture or minorities the more opportunity not only politically that comes with it\nBut the better the opportunity for the entire country open minds equal better opportunities and a better chance for a more moral nation because if we adhered to pull politics and the people that start out on that sliding scale of morality\nFrom a really negative place\nWhere are we going to be taken for the people who wanted to believe for example Christine Ford and Chuck Schumer who said he believed her Dianne Feinstein who believes her people believe them\nSo you have people that started out and that sliding scale morality and an amoral place and have taken their politics and those folks left with them\nThat's not good Donald Trump taken whole minority communities including black adults women Hispanics\nEven Native Americans to new heights economically that they had never seen before bats that shade and change it and that's the difference and that's the irony of Donald Trump who in his own personal life maybe not the most moral man fine and the grand scheme of sliding scale morality\nOne politician has kept more promises inside of two years then that man that always told me that the there are two kinds of people you got people who will tell you something and you can't believe it and you got people who will tell you something and you can take it to the bank\nWhen Donald Trump says something you can pretty much take it to the bank I'm Brian mud in for the gray one month\nHim Washington Mall W.

M. A. L.\nWashington comes to talk [noise]\nThey play for the government was\nSmart smart guy let me\nOh there you go I mean go Kevin assume\nSarah Huckabee Sanders gun us\nTalking about the ... entertaining exchanges you heard the president he said he could do it for many done what you want a bad but there is a certain amount\nHave talked about some entertaining exchanges have you heard the president he said he could talk for many time why do you want the bad but there is a certain amount of empowerment that God gave feels I mean like ... and it's the president said he is smart cookie [laughter] [laughter]\nYou can also see him going you know what the president said I can speak for many time\n... that could be entertaining and has a ... we'll see where that story ... now a a story that I\nCan't believe it is still being discussed one that has been long perpetuated as a fraud not as significant as the Medicare fraud the Medicare for all idea that we were just talking about but the minimum wage\nThe the greatest fraud perpetuated over decades of time has been the need for the minimum wage to be maintained by your federal government now recently we had the Amazon dot com increased to Fifteen dollars per hour which in and of itself and don't get me wrong\nAmazon they built a better mouse trap but I mean the puck proceeded to talk about the a buck or see on the left and it was no balance remember a once upon a time\nWal Mart was the greatest have full in the country because they were coming to your neighborhood and and killing mom ... they were taking them out there taking their businesses and then they were ah putting a bunch of people on the as minimum wage right a plus a Wal Mart\nThere from uh from Republican place aren't they have their those people so I mean for all those reasons so many Walmart was just a evil\nBut here you go you've got a you've got Amazon dot com they happen to be greater than three times the size of Wal Mart yes yes the Amazon is three hundred percent the size and market capitalization of Walmart and loved by the left\nBut again you know I I big ... big rush them nothing happened to be a capitalist they built the better mouse trap but anyway I digress so Amazon goes to Fifteen dollars per hour and then you hear the the folks go\nEverybody should take Amazon model now I Will point out some of the obvious here\nFor people to understand economics there are many other businesses that operate in retail which happens to be a low margin business there are getting crushed by Amazon dining ironically enough are going to have a harder time increasing wages because Amazon at their size scale and ability to deliver the way they're delivering\n[laughter] they ... they are killing the profits or take a look at any number of you'll retail companies that you grew up with that are dead and dying as we speak now\nThan not withstanding\nThe number of people that actually earned minimum wage I went back and actually check my research on this and ironically enough the last time it was a really big issue and kind of like coming off the Occupy\nCrowd and the twenty fourteen mid term elections I happen to be about four years ago that we had the the big minimum wage conversation and hey you know what a lot of folks in the country had a point\nBecause they did kind of ... you know for eight years of Obama we average one point eight percent economic growth we never even got close to an average US Economy so yeah okay but even then what percentage of people earned\nMinimum wage yeah number in your head how many people back in twenty fourteen you think earned minimum wage already one point eight percent even ...\nObama's economy it was only one point eight percent what's more is the average age of somebody who earned minimum wage happened to be twenty two and a half but it'd be working part time\nJob and I mean you know that the people that were heads of households that were you know trying to raise a family and uh you know they needed a living wage right\nBut that was then and when I got the best economy in a generation we've got the lowest unemployment rate in forty nine years weve got record low unemployment rates for everybody but pretty much why the white people\nAnd how many people actually earned the minimum wage\nYou're reading according to the bureau of Labor Statistics point six percent\nPoint six percent zero zero point six percent now what's more is that Ninety nine percent of those people be point six percent are under the age of twenty five\nAnd what happened as soon as Amazon raise those wages we got the minimum wage conversation come up again ah\nOne of the great frauds perpetuated that's out there still living wage is funny what actually happened a good economy economics Amazon dot com profs prospering and they had the financial wherewithal to be able to increase wages just like what we're seeing because here's another little factoid oh by the way\nWe need to take a look at the average amount of money\nJust just like what we're seeing because here's another little factoids oh by the way\nWe take a look at the average amount of money that a person can not only are we finally\nJust about a three percent towards a wage growth by the time yet and bonuses goes over that by the time you add in your tax cut churns out to be about another Eighteen hundred bucks for the average person working this year is what\nThe average Jeanette take home pay now a six point seven percent year over year you have to go back thirty two years to find the last time your income growth\nThat good [noise] so [noise] the living wage [noise]\nFunny what happens when you actually have a good economy living wage and the minimum wage\nIt's just a bunch of BS\nMedicare for all\nSides authorities one side effects will continue to do a lot more\nThe factual stuff right here I Am by mud in for the great one Marshall that\nThis year buybacks right this horrible shareholders of which you probably are one\nActually the employees get this according to the CFO council CNBC is now thirty five percent thirty five percent\nOf all tax cuts savings has gone to a combination of bonuses and then pull you raise is\nThirty five percent twenty percent has gone into debt reduction which makes sense we've seen interest rates rise companies that have dead they should pay it off that helps the company become more stable essence their debt burden with rights rising\nFifteen Percent Fifteen Percent on share buybacks ten percent upgrading software five percent upgrading ... uh upgrading equipment and five percent have increased evidence so all in the combination of share about buybacks in David in payouts twenty percent that's it\nAnd even then you probably benefit because once again something that is not perpetuated informational lead by our friends and media generally\nFifty two percent of Americans own stocks and by the way despite the volatility of the past few days way with the greatest wealth creation machine the history of the world is your United States stock market so I don't apologize for that anyway but the biggest beneficiary is you\nThe employee but [noise] you know\nI I guess conveniently that that message has just been missed you know I I'm sure that any day now it's going to be a big story that will be a reported on\nAnd again CNBC they're the ones with that story interesting how even NBC ... other news outlets hasn't decided to actually run with their own story from their own CFO council\nOne of these days I'm sure it's just over ... All right let's go to Ross in South Dakota Russ go\nProbably doing all good [laughter]\nWell I see it as kind of a ... problem really I mean you get a single payer healthcare system and you're going to basically just keep these big hospital in the smaller ones they're not going to survive\nYou know they're not going to make the money that these bigger wants to make it out because they can't cut the costs that the government wants to cut them down to you for all of this stuff\nThat's the first part I see\nThe second part I see if we need to adjust something in the hospital\nThey know what it costs to manufacture up one thousand feet of sea bag of fluids I Would think not much I'm guessing you know a dollar I I did the research for my call just to make sure I had the numbers right and you know what they charge you for it in the hospital and a lot more than ... hundred dollars well and\nAnd so Ross and I appreciate the call and you have a in a a good point by the a couple of things in it that we should discuss when we're talking about insurance generally\nThe biggest problem and affordability in health care is health insurance\nThe problem is we had been raised the idea that health insurance equals healthcare\nThat's not the case one of the more remarkable statistics in the wake of Obamacare has been the lack of people that can afford health care with health insurance\nAccording to the Kaiser Family foundation hardly a conservative organization they failed to this day are proponents of Obamacare I mean after all the kind of have a vested interest\nBut here's what they found in their research there are forty two million Americans forty two million have health insurance they can't afford healthcare you think about that for a moment\nThe average health insurance plan eighty five hundred dollars now if you don't pay all that they might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the only an average cost of health insurance right now\nNow if you don't pay all that they might be because your employer sponsoring it but that's the only the average cost of health insurance right now\nSo would you be better off\nIf you had eighty five hundred dollars but you could use on health care or would you be better off if eighty five hundred dollars whip for health insurance and then after that you got to see how much you had to pay out of pocket before you hit the deductible which often happens to be a high deductible\nPlan which state and you can't hit which is why people can't afford health care that's all part of the financial fraud so the number one way\nTo get to more affordable health care is to break the back of the insurance first model have embraced it was the first thing that we did that was a big time mistake\nOnce you do that you are going to get to the crux of what you were talking about there which is consumer price transparency the most bad crap crazy thing I have ever seen in my life\nIs walking into a medical facility being handed a piece of paper that says in so many words that whatever happens in that facility\nWhich you have no clue and generally yet what that's going to be in whatever it happens to cost which state and generally can't even tell you\nAnd whatever your insurance company doesn't pay for which they also can't tell you you'll pay for\nHow crazy is that you mentioned walking into a store building a car with stuff not having a clue what any of it costs and signing that piece of paper that says some point later we're going to tell you how much you're going to pay us for this\nAnd that is bad crap crazy\nBut that's what we have with our insurance first model right now\nSo you break the back of it we get to weigh the way we use the shirts for everything else in her life how is that well what we do if we have you know the chemical problem with our car well we we go pay inhabits ex\nIf we get in a big time accident we fall and insurance claims were already at the point with health insurance to where it's essentially a catastrophic care for tens of millions of Americans right can't afford to use health care the rest of the time\nOkay so why don't we go to that place to where we use health insurance as a catastrophic plan which by the way is what the president's new plans the ones that are called skinny and bad plans and but the Democrats are are sitting there you know what I'm saying it's the worst thing that's essentially what they are is catastrophic care\nWhich is cheaper and better for people who otherwise wouldn't be able to afford to use the other more expensive policies anyway\nBut at that point you're able to do what you're able to be a consumer we are incredibly good consumers when we have an opportunity to shop oh we gotta find the best deal in the world on MTV or whatever else it is will sit there and we'll take a look at best deal boom done\nBut was health care we never have a shot we never have a shot at doing it on the things I Do somewhat routinely I'll take a look anytime we have research that will show the costs of a procedure from one place to the next\nUm I had a I had a minor surgery years ago that had I gone through my insurance would have cost a thousand bucks\nDecided to shop around\nPaid cash and it was five hundred dollars sounded to the point there\nWe never know because we sign pieces of paper or those that something's gonna happen here and we'll pay you for whatever the insurance company doesn't so they'd be if you really want to get to the crux of it not only is Medicare for all financial fraud but frankly the\nBiggest lie of Obamacare is not the you know it's going to be cheaper and you can keep your doctor and all that\nIt's an insurance equals healthcare insurance doesn't equal healthcare insurance is the antithesis of healthcare for tens of millions of Americans will can say the conversation coming up next I'm Brian mud and for the great one month\nAsk any a Mac remember what they like most about belonging to the

Wonder what she was really taken by the end of that interview by the way and it's fascinating to do what ultimately didn't make it because lord knows how much they had that they went ahead and edited out but anyway uh so we're talking about the lack of climate credibility at the United nations now\nShared with you really well done um bees from the specter that put in context power wall and United Nations has been under climate prediction every single year for years yet\nFor some reason they retain credibility for some reason we subsidize this nonsense for some reason and we know what the reasons are all political it's embraced by those on the left now\nI think any honest and decent person you are wrong if you are white heck wrong for your entire professional career somewhere along the way you'd have a sense of you know maybe I should do something else\nBut if you are part of the leftist climate science crowd\nYou're gonna keep on keep it on and they're gonna keep on federal and your your nonsense and that's exactly what we've seen it's fascinating as you take a look at the entire way this thing came full circle you go back to the Nineteen seventies while was that it was the big global cooling and the ice age ...\nSo I uh actually pulled earlier this week and the un report came out in the June twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy four times article it was based on this climate science called another onstage\nAnd then on April twenty eight Nineteen Seventy five Newsweek they published a story that cooling in the world because that's what was going on\nManmade global cooling\nAnd then somewhere along the way it's like oh crap well that's not working out so then it became one in the eighties and nineties you'll remember what it was remember now every aerosol can every little above that hairspray for that big eighties here that was another chunk out ozone\nLayer oh yeah the elimination of the ozone layer and then somewhere along the way are like oh you know what it actually\nHas something to do with the ozone layer and guess what if we actually get a gate at the entire effort of this world towards eliminating that we probably couldn't because we're probably not going to be highly effective at taking out the sun oh and by the way some of those are holes [laughter]\nFunny thing is sunspots you know [noise] so that went away and then what it did it become ... global warming only got global warming for many years Frank\nAnd then ...\nNot buying it to go from global cooling we go from the ozone layer to global warming to something that actually Israel does something that's actually real to climate change\nAnd that is how they completed the corrupt circle because climate change Israel always has been always will be funny things happen we'd had ice ages we've had periods of extreme heat\nWe've had a minimum of three mass extinction events all remarkably enough before we were even on this planet\nIt must have been on like the the dinosaur flatulence you know you know like a cow farts they actually are more political than than like a you know cars so if you just had a if you think about it is it the pita crowds to really think about this for a moment and if we don't eat meat\nI I mean what happens you care more about the the ... or do you care about uh you know your your climate change there because they got you know we have more cows what's going to happen\nThis is a real moral dilemma you should consider this anyway apparently or what\nHappened was a bunch of ... and I dunno flatulence ended up leading to a mass to extinction events ... will be just you know following all the logic to its natural conclusion you say\nOnce again two sides of stories one side of the facts I joined back then we'll continue to bring them to you I Am Brian money for the gray one margin\nThere's something else that is kind of a an important in the cons contacts in the conversation and this is a a meeting you for anybody who could be a long any coastline you'd be in the northeast could be anywhere in between you could be on the Gulf and take a look what happened to Mexico beach\nI ah I had an idea there is one silver lining that came out a Hurricane Andrew was building codes we have what's called the Miami Dade code that is rock solid you don't do anything but concrete anymore\nAnd affected areas and it makes a difference every now and then you see the pictures to Mexico beach you'll see structures that are still standing right next to whole areas that are just completely wiped down nothing but debris and you'll what's the difference there\nHad an idea that a lot of those homes were built well before we had the Miami Dade standards after Hurricane Andrew in Ninety two went back and took a look the average home that was built Mexico beach is Nineteen eighty three Nineteen eighty three\nWell before the standards would framed homes and so the media you is your in one of those types of homes and you're at a point to where you could be impacted by a hurricane\nYou know you you might want to think about your situation because if you get a hurricane that's like a tornado comes near you you know think about the impact in your home the ones that are standing\nBy and large are your structures that were built\nAfter Ninety two with those upgraded and updated standards to me and the difference not only in life and death but it can make the difference in your home being there versus your home being wiped out to make the difference between a community that can be rebuilt and something that isn't even recognize civil\nWas mentioning Hurricane Irma last year you go to the er the lower keys\nYou'll see when you go down there every now and then it's like huh wow it seems like there's a lot of space where they're used to be homes\nThat's the case there are there any more Arabs completely wiped out many of them were just taken straight into the ocean and the and the lower keys or or when they came through and he got others Mm couple of shingles missing\nCan be the difference a life and death big big deal so anyway\nAh just ah as you're seeing these pictures putting everything in context\nA you know you get it was a I think very very much like Andrew in I think we're very fortunate that it went in in an area that was ... as sparsely populated relatively as that area to minimize the damage the devastation where it cause because it is real\nBut thank God it didn't go into a place where you had millions of people for example at that side and that strength\nAlright uh been talking about some of the financial frauds the climate front throughout the course of the show oh we're going to check in Todd wanted to talk about single payer Todd in Ohio do\nOr not to be honest to this one are pointing out real\nQuick what are your friends can check it out are paying back now onto your two birds out loud or were Crowder\nUnder Cover the Canadian health care system they have a couple of his buddies go in with cameras hit then try to get healthcare Canada is buddies are preparing to\nBan this go watch and see how bad this is I mean it's like for our series or four hours more to see a doctor so you're there like eight hours earlier but on ... days\nThey're closed on the weekends or no care on the weekends or but if you go to the private sector but just the basic jacked up the nurse told him that Tom from nine hundred dollars if I went to a private doctor\nThat single payer health care a bird just north of us are sort of labor and people need to go see how bad of an idea this is they're doing really good job showing it on there so\nThe our TV ah yeah go check it out appreciate it does\nAnd uh by the way you know you're you're absolutely right uh I run a clean up being here in South Florida we've got a ton of Canadians especially starting in about a month during what turns out to be our season and a lot of folks come year round for exactly the reason you're talking about health care because yes when you are in that type of environment\nUltimately you're at the mercy of the system and the system ultimately is going to weld dictate unless you end up paying through the nose the exact a different outcome which is why off and people come here get better choice of care it's funny how that whole thing works uh yeah yeah and and let's just talk and ubiquitous terms for a moment\nBecause I like simple concepts to complicated topics or ones that at least have been a bastard eyes as health care has been what has the government taking over\nA bastard die as health care has been\nWhat has the government taking over it's gotten better\nAt you know somebody that what is the government taking over but it's gotten better or what in particular as the government had more influence on over the course of time but it's gotten better in your whole life\nThis blood that question is somebody the words ... ... there'll be some crickets chirping\nOn the other end there by the way talking about the er TV uh you also can check out life liberty and live and Fox News or ten eastern if you don't already do this and do what I Do I have to get up early
