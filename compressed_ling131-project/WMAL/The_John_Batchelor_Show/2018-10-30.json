a\nHorrible horrible weekend well let's let's jump into the news\nOver the weekend obviously the worst inspection you attack in the history of the United states eleven people murdered in a synagogue during what we call a Brittany law\nA breast which is where in a day old boy circumcised and the baby naming ceremony takes place at that point as a conservative synagogue not politically conservative than a dog a religiously\nConservative synagogue in Judaism in American journalism anyway there are several branches of Judaism I'm an Orthodox Jew which means deeply observing keeps habit don't drive on Saturday keep kosher there's conservative Judaism which is\nSort of less orthodox people drive on Saturday sort of the foremost habit or they don't keep kosher but they have certain respect for it to our laws in any case\nThis concern a than a ... didn't have much security and an anti Semitic white supremacist but I hate myself walk into the Pentagon armed with an air campaign and proceeded to shut up the Brits me like he was screaming at the time all Jews must die so obviously it's settled fella\nSo why does it matter of personal I I think that we need to get something off the table right away when an anti Semitic attack occurs\nGenerally don't need to bother blaming particular politicians anti Semitism is literally as all the Jewish people literally as old as the Jewish people and other politicians in the past who have called for anti Semitism their politicians in the past who've actually called for the murder of June\nI'm not saying a lot of those on today's Americans saying there are a lot of politicians on Native American theme hobnobbing with anti Semite who make common cause with anti summit don't get to all of that in just a second but\nFolks who are blaming the left or the right for the answer to that shouldn't have happened yesterday white supremacist on an anti Semitic attacks on Jews had existed for decades in the country and long before anything that is going on in today's politics and it's not downplay what's happening in today's topic is what the rest of the show is going to be about but let's just be clear about this\nWhen it comes to attacks on Jews there is nothing new under the sun legitimately nothing new under the sun I don't know a single too\nThere's a single Jew who is not one degree removed from a violent attack on a Jew and that's not saying that America's violent country for ... it is not America if you have this country in world history for ...\nAmerica's incredible place project but because the Jewish population is so small and because so many Jews know each other and because the Jews sort of consider themselves and extended family just as Christians consider themselves and extended religious family\nIt's difficult not to feel it deeply obviously when when an attack like this takes place the history of the Jewish people is filled with fractious division but history history and the Jews the court closely bound\nDeeply obviously when when an attack like this takes place the history of the Jewish people is filled with fractious division but history history and the Jews the coke closely bound unit Jewish identity isn't really a choice it's a reality\nMainstream members in the Democratic party routinely hobnobbing with that I sound like for the Jewish community really produce really care about being Jewish there's not a way of difference between a job or for being a Jew in Jerusalem and you learn from her being Jewish in France or giving more for being Jewish and Pittsburgh it's all of the peace\nIt's going to talk about anti Semitic rhetoric and who's to blame for writing Jewish that the world over a rise in hate crime of the world over the lead to actually talk about it wants to talk about that I think what they want to partisan hacker it\nLet me are happy to talk about President Trump\nWinking and nodding at the outright and two thousand sixteen thousand Seventeen they're living in a less apt

the\nMasses adventure the Russia also media are very focused in on his President Trump's fault everything is president from salt because he was winking and nodding and the alt right in twenty sixteen twenty Seventeen as I say and have said many times over I was there I remember I condemned it I condemn it by the fact is we need to be honest about them\nLet's be clear about this when president from\nPride to wake and not at All right he was taking a fringe group a fringe group\nThat was not associated with the conservative movement and he was winking and nodding at them for political purposes and then you toss them out on their ear which is why they're angry with him in mainstream Democratic Party the mainstream Democratic Party and the left in this country have decided that it is perfectly fine to hobnobbing with people who support anti Medicare isn't\nThey've decided that's okay I'm not blaming those folks for what happened in Pittsburgh that's not their fault either\nBut if we're going to talk about rhetoric and its impact on anti Jewish sentiment the world over I'm gonna go with the folks who every time there's a war in the Gaza Strip suggests they choose the world over are to blame or suggest that Israel is to blame for defending itself or suggest that when Jews are attacking a kosher supermarket in France but that that's a random attack\n... will condemn reckless condemn writer I'd I'm happy to separate rhetoric from violence and happened to that at all side\nIf we're gonna talk rhetoric you have to condemn rhetoric when it happens where it happened and from ...\nCondemned President Trump when he was candidate from doing this nonsense the all right I did it over and over and over and done the same thing with ... I don't see anyone on the left doing the same thing to folks on the left I can only doing it to folks on the right for partisan political reason that's all I'm seeing I'm seeing a bunch of people who don't get a good damn when he gets killed in Jerusalem\nPopping out of the woodwork to say that the rate is responsible for what just happened in Pittsburgh all the while championing an Iran deal the Lincoln ... millions of people if the rainy and have their way\nAnd that is partisanship that is a tough thing partisanship and that will show you that sort of partisanship in just a second because that's the\nPoint that we're actually going to talk about policy what separate rhetoric and policy for just a second again I'm\nFor the one time when anti Semitic rhetoric or rhetoric that putt putt anti Semitism takes place I Will condemn loudly and strongly as I hadn't even go back and listen to the show I've done it every step of the way against people on all sides I don't care I'll keep doing it\nBecause the right thing to do I'll do the same thing with racist rhetoric I'm happy to do it on every side Kevin now let's talk about policy which policy is getting she was killed if you're talking about policies that lead the Jews dying\nIt ain't President Trump's policy and the Obama administration lie in the American people and promoted neurons heal that gave the mullahs the a clear pathway to a nuclear weapon\nPresident from not only move the embassy to Jerusalem you also cut off aid to the ... the anti Semitic openly in Medicare supporting Palestinian Authority you a bomb in his ration tried to make Israel make concessions to those terrorists\nBombing in ... in the middle of the Gaza War in two thousand fourteen threatened to cut off military supplies to the Israeli the Obama administration was just blatantly not only anti Israel but\n... a promotional or they wing of of progressive views for progressive isn't came person Judaism came second\nSo we're going to talk about policy that led to Jews forget they forget the location\nThan you actually have to talk level or another and talk about any of that stuff obviously we're not going to talk about any of that stuff so that was talking about how the media ... responded that's because while it's just tremendously dishonest so let's start with a media story\nNow let's talk about how the media ... responded because while it just tremendously dishonest so let's start with a media story\nThat I'm currently I'm Sorry that the all the deeply offending a blip setting because we should all be on the same time when it comes to anti Semitism I think that we probably all would be on the same side when it comes down to some of them but nobody is actually willing to call it anti Semitism and when and where it exist on any side almost they're busy defending\nI mean headline was eleven killed and shooting at Pittsburgh synagogue and then underneath that headline that says Trump allies set the tone for violence they denounce critics say really that's what we're going now Trump allies set the tone for violent denounce critics say well that's that's a fun way to journalism critics say the one I have an opinion I just stay in\nThe Washington Post has an opinion they just say critics say how\nConvenient how convenient and then you have ... and they still call journalistic you know here's a reason to be mad at Trump back in two thousand Fifteen thousand sixteen she wrote a piece for GQ about millennia Trump wasn't very nice and\nA bunch of all writers and ... an anti Semitic fashion President Trump was asked about it he didn't condemn it that was gross that was stupid and that was wrong I said so at the time go back and listen to that they\nHave a truly a job he has gone off or rocker here's what she waited too overwhelming gentile telling me what to think and not the ... and not think about the synagogue shouldn't today highly shut up today is you're going to be quiet\nNo everyone is entitled to their opinion the question is whether that opinion is good or not like for example Juliet dropping a Jew or opinions suck\nRight here is or who are second take on this\nOrange my fellow American Jews the president makes this possible here where you live out the embassy move over there where you don't live was worth it now it's using Jews in the United states who voted for President Trump or support President Trump now of do a loyalty they care about Jews in Israel and non Jews in America because the president is getting killed in America well he's being pro Israel\nExcept for the fact that the shooter specifically hated President Trump and except for the fact that you don't get to blame Jews for how they vote on Jews getting killed and blaming the victims ... anybody at the synagogue voted\nMaybe they voted for Trump maybe they didn't it doesn't matter you don't get to blame people for the death of other people when they have no connection to the death of other people\nBut this is what the weapons decided to do they've decided that every bad thing that happens in the country from an evil person\nHas to be the result of President Trump's rhetoric now again I condemned to President Trump when it came to the right stuff but you can't show me the connection that is solid between what happened at the Pittsburgh synagogue and President Trump's all wrapped up number one and number two\nIf we're going to talk about rhetoric that leads to violence against Jews that's going to open a whole can of worms I don't think the last one to open\nAnd Maddox lazy as who is just\nAn idiot and many of these Ralph he's Ralphie from from The Simpsons over and over ... weed out about Steve ... leads you to go he said this morning's attack as a reminder that anti Semitism and other forms of bigotry still persists in our society and must be confronted in combat in return Iglesias when David do without the baggage\nEvery Republican is responsible for a white nationalist shooting up us in a dog ... I'm an Orthodox Jew this is a lie is a lie I go to synagogue way more than any of the people who I quoted so far in the show\nAnd not only that I'm seeing an argument being made well get to this and the second the gun control argument that as being made by folks on the left in response to all of this you know my response to solve it says\nI'm going to start carrying a gun to shall\nSay that's my response to all this marathon does Jews should be armed people and synagogues should be armed\nAnd you know why because white nationalist are not gonna give up their done\nEvil people don't give up their gun that means I Want more people at my school arm I Will or security guards and Marshall gets all of that\nIn just a second but first let's talk about life insurance life insurance is certainly not most enjoyable thing to talk about most people don't like to think about what happens after God Forbid something happens to you but actually having life insurance is a really good feeling it's nice to know that if anything were to happen your family won't have started off on me policy genius as the easy way to get life insurance on line and just two minutes you\nCan compare quotes from the top insurers to find the best policy for you and when you compare court you save money it is indeed that simple policy genius has helped them for a million people shop for insurance they placed over twenty billion dollars in coverage they don't just do life insurance sales have your disability insurance and auto insurance home insurance\nIf you care about it they can cover itself if you've been avoiding getting life insurance because it's difficult or confusing if policy genius of tried just go to policy genius dot com air quotes applying minutes into the whole thing on your phone right now policy geniuses indeed the easy way to compare and by life insurance there's no reason for you to put it off actually irresponsible for you\nNot to have life insurance policy genius makes everything really easy because again in two minutes you can compare quotes from the top insurers and find the best policy for you go save money policy genius dot com and the easy way to compare and by life insurance\nAs I say members of the Democratic left have decided that when an anti Semitic shooting takes place in Pittsburgh that has nothing to do with President Trump is obviously President Trump's fault and they've continued with his narrative Franklin ...\nWho is a columnist over the land store the full column basically on this idea that members of the Jewish community who support Republicans are responsible he tweeted the organized shutting up Sheldon Adelson Jared Kushner and other ... as a matter of protecting the secure\nYeah the members of the Jewish community who support Republicans are responsible he tweeted the organized shutting of Sheldon Adelson Jared Kushner and other Jewish enablers as a matter of protecting the security of the community so they get this right being mean to Jared Kushner is now going to prevent shootings and synagogues\nMhm Sheldon Adelson one of the great supporters of Israel in the United states and one of the great supporters of Jewish programs like birth rate in the United states that is somehow going to make you safer in the United states\nSo if you elect rock Obama or if you elect Keith Ellison work elect a bunch of Democrats who openly hobnobbing with one that's our sore and that makes you safer but if you Shaun the most pro Israel president in American history\nAnd any support that President even while condemning his rhetoric than you are somehow making the Jewish community safer\nAnd then you get folks like Adam Schiff and Democrat from California because President Trump set the tone of hatred this is an easy argument always again ... this is just an extension of the argument made last week about the bombing attempt against democratic members\nThat rhetoric is is what causes violence\nI don't remember any of these conversations happening on mainstream television after Bernie Sanders supporters shot up a bunch of Congress people on a congressional baseball field I don't remember these conversations happening for longer than two days it was out of the headlines immediately now we're going to get nothing but this for months because this was always let let's be clear about something this was always going to be the Democratic narrative\nAlmost has nothing to do as President Trump President Trump plays right into the heart of it because you can't shut his base but\nThis has almost nothing to do with President Trump is this happening under President Bush you get the same crap because this happened under President Romney you get the same crap would not matter people on the left practicing Jeff ...

I Believe what happened in Pittsburgh and you can\nYou can separate out all these issues you can condemn bad rhetoric when you see it on any side without doing this routine is part of an act job where Adam Schiff then suddenly the great arbiter of decent rhetoric in the middle of a terrible political time\nKnowing sets the tone more than president and I'd say it's a and they're told that he says his one of division off in one of hatred or sometimes one of incitement to violence against journalists a and there's no escaping or collective responsibility but there's always scraping the tone of your ... for the country\nOkay it's just it again I agree that President Trump's instead of better at home for the country to blame President Trump's tone for everything that has happened church import is insane and the tone of the country was already off the rails by twenty twelve years since we've had a decent political conversation in this country is getting very very long time\nBut let's not pretend that in the world started spinning when president from suddenly entered the political spent ... scene and let's stop pretending that the Democratic party has clean hands when it comes to association with anti Semite\nAnd one of the one of the more scoreless attacks on on Trump and folks on the right is he suggesting that if you're a critical of George Soros you were somehow anti Semitic\nAnd so there's been a big narrative put out by folks on the left that George Soros who is a lean democratic donor that if you criticize George Soros by suggesting that he gives a lot of money to causes are inferior then this means that you are somehow anti Semitic\nNow you can attach George Soros and an anti Semitic way you can suggest that is part of the Jewish ... attempting to run the country but it seems to me that the criticism of George Soros on the right on the mainstream right has been\nNo more market than the criticism Sheldon Adelson on the left\nIt seems to me that the criticism of George Soros is very much akin to the criticism of the Koch brothers on the left and yet the idea now is that we're going to spend every critique of George Soros into this is all about George Soros is Jewish heritage which is nonsense but again CNN is pushing this fire in and say you're blaming them are you blaming them\nI'm blaming them for putting gifts over here and not computer correct to give it a real time and I so far as I Do twelve hours later doing nothing about it I don't believe me honestly if this level after we have to go sort of low regard and I've known all those people in the past ... on TV every night on blaming the management of Fox and the investors and fire when he's talking about here and there was a fire in the\n... who said that the caravan had something to do with the Soros the Soros run State Department or something like that\nAnd now is that anti Semitic know and maybe idiotic but it's not anti Semitic and George Soros doesn't run the state department but the idea that going after George Soros as an various force in American politics is somehow inherently anti Semitic is ridiculous and the same way as ingesting the going after Sheldon Adelson is inherently anti Semitic when he's a major donor to the Republican\nParty but Democrats are looking for a narrative they found a convenient narrative again\nI'm not going to pretend I'm not going to pretend that the left has\nHands when it comes to fighting anti Semitism and they certainly not in the women's march pointed out their sympathy for all of that they didn't win it feeds him and said we are turning our grief to action with\nWith Jewish Action than a clear message that these anti American Xena phobic attacks can never happen again if you're not in DC turning around three PM to our Facebook page watching ... the women's march includes to head women who associate openly and defend ...\nI'm not interested in your help ladies have you with your usa denounced the anti Semitism in your own time not interested there's solid\nI'm not interested in your health ladies\n... usa denounced the anti Semitism in your own that I'm not interested in solidarity event in New York City Al Sharpton showed up at the solidarity of them\nIs there anything more power than in ...

the blow to the nation or the very hard blow on an attack on a synagogue innocent people shot\nWe're told and the allegation is against a man who as\nAt this point appeared in court he used to be

marching marching marching the latest news is that more than five thousand military personnel are headed to the border in various stages\nTexas Arizona New Mexico California the news from Central America and from Mexico is that\nThere are there maybe two or more caravans marching\nYoung men we see video now that some of them are violent as you can understand in that heat with very little prospect of six test leaving their homes and marching north for unclear purposes [noise]\nAh ... the first caravan is now about four thousand according to the latest grows and shrinks to reach the U.S border perhaps around the time the elections so\nGentleman the polls are moving but who can tell David I start with you is the caravan a story about the polls or is this split screen election\nWell I think it's a split screen election in part because where I think kind of back to where we were at the beginning of summer which is a house that is poised to flip to the Democrats may not but I think it's it's it's sort of headed there and the Senate that it's not going to end you have two different battleground\nThat's that is poised to flip to the Democrats may not but I think it's it's it's sort of headed there and the Senate that is not going to and you have two different battleground Syria with the uh suburban and ... battleground where Indians and Trump are\nAre mixed at best to very poor and voters interested in and making changes for all sorts of reasons and then in the Senate you have a very pro Trump Republican battleground bunch of red states\nWhere Republicans are poised to not only keep their majority but add to it and so I think things like the caravan may be a helpful in the Senate races where we know the Kavanaugh episode woke up complacent Republican electorate and got an energized and\nThe caravan is certainly not going to be on your helpful um and it may be helpful in some of these races although I don't know if a Republican need much more help in the Senate races at this point I don't think it's going to\nLeave that determinative if at all in the house and I think part of that is there are now so many competing issues are that are helpful to Democrats or helpful in terms of where they're going to steer independence and then I think they're going to overtake the care of an issue but in part it's just because we have two different battle\n[noise] um it's fun the Trump voters in twenty sixteen were not routinely people that the Republican Party counted on for voting I'm being very diplomatic wondering around this story are they going to turn out is there an issue they care about or did they wait for twenty\nFive spoke tonight with John McLaughlin a Republican pollster who says the most important issue next Tuesday will be does the Trump will turn out\nAnd that's why Trump is so assiduously going to Trump centers in Fifteen twenty states are running six rallies between now and the election trying to get out the vote\nA he's not going to any counties were he was close who lost to Hillary\nBob we will know that and I'm I suspect them the whole thing about the caravan is about driving up the Trump vote saying that you know on President but you do no time for relaxation the country is still in danger and that's why Trump uses such Marshall language even the\nTone that would seem inappropriate after Pittsburgh he's trying to basically say we're still in a war footing which means we have to demand sacrifices from you'll go vote\nThat is to have a question a general we're talking you know obviously it's a mid term it's a base election both sides want to turn their supporters out are you seeing any single issue that is really swing the independence one way or another David [noise]\nI don't know if we're seeing a single issue I think ultimately Trump is the factor and where Trump can be helpful and John mentioned where he's going to be traveling\nTrump is helping to turn out his base and what we're seeing unlike a year ago is very little separation between the Trump base and the standard Republican base and there's little separation between the Trump base in the Republican incumbent who Trump didn't always get along with but does at the moment\nI I think in the house it's working against Republicans by and large you just have so much energy and money even where Republican enthusiasm has picked up\nUm they're still fighting across such a big plane field it's become so why even today the Republican House campaign committee ... advertising in Charleston South Carolina in a district\nThat are elected Tim Scott a few years ago and really shouldn't be a problem for the Republicans but it all say they're just so many house districts that are competing for because of all this anger and ain't that has been motivated by a a rejection of Trump but that's what's making it very hard for for Republicans in terms of the house fight\nJohn you know the first billionaire president ever elected has apparently encourage lots of other billionaires to go take 'em down a Michael Bloomberg who's obviously running for the Democratic nomination won\nSome scouts civil all he is dumb to I think in the last day or two six million dollars any single house race Dana Rohrabacher is in California which is now I think the most expensive house race in the country almost thirty six million dollars spent\nThe amount of money that his poured into this widened the playing field a David mentioned just astonishing we have never seen a party control Congress\nAnd be so swamped in terms of resources\nBy the opposition party which is a minority\nOr it's almost as if K Street spiritual donors are irrelevant these super PACs are by the way Democrats by the way no longer complaining about Citizens United you'll notice these super PACs and these billionaires are dominating the playing field financially in the selection of the Citizens United has not benefiting the Democrats the Republicans\nAnd John six million dollars from Bloomberg one district in one district because he wants the house that's it\nHe wants credit for turning the house he wants to read it for carrying certain districts he wants to establish his bona fide either the Democrats\nUtah Mr Clinton teased is again John today\nWell if the Democrats take the house\nHe wants to establish his bona fide he's as a Democrat\nYou thought Mr Clinton teased his again job today\nWell if the Democrats take the house you'll hear more rumblings about that or it may be implausible but she just she she looks at

know I Know right so I'm saying that you know and the site and every place and and YPG course stepped up its efforts we have a meeting tomorrow where we bring everybody together\nTo address that subject that once and for what we have to make security a priority and while law enforcement everybody has its role and government has to help it's got to start with the communities will help every community because the more we do\nThe more the police can do and and that we fill in the gaps that they don't have to do and this is it has to be a priority and the the you know it's expensive it's difficult when you have such a plethora of schools and synagogues and other institutions so much infrastructure here\nBut we have to find a way to improve it and that means it has to be societal because putting the band aids on is not enough\nQuickly or the Palestinians are threatening to reject recognizing Israel how do they put it\nThat the pillows central council met today this was a non

trip to Oman girl said great\nVery important in a very positive and because they allow that to be publicized even more and now they talk about it and they said that you know this the whole reaction in

it's a he has tried to the ruler of a month to bring the Israelis and Palestinians gather\nA and we'll see whether that plays out the the other big measure was today in Abu Dhabi where the Israelis

were\nSomehow otherwise um fled the area that we're able to uh to shut the fire besides American saw some of it taking place that by happenstance that the wind blew from the\nTurkish quarter towards
