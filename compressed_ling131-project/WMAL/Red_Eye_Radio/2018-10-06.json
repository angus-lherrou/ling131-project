the chairman of that committee on friday wrote a letter to the Senate Judiciary committee unsaid\nUm they've asked us speak for the committee\nSo and there's you don't use even in a store and there

in you and I said we don't make predictions look if you if you look at past history the Republicans should lose\nA house members mhm that's what happens I mean it's almost a a a a a a guaranteed right just like when somebody asked us up back in twenty sixteen oh you're going to be surprised Trump's going to win I said well actually we won't be because\nThe history shows us that when you had this long of a down economy the opposition party usually wins and that that's what uh what what what happens what's\nGonna happen here I don't know it will tell you about you know you saw the NPR\nA poll

nobody really has that don't work cobra electronics here's your forecast\nWe started the week with heavy rain in the desert southwest that has cleared out the problem area now for potential flash flooding heavy amounts of rain and maybe even some local severe weather today including high winds hail and some locally produced thunderstorms and tornadoes is the central Midwest\nSections of central Kansas into eastern Iowa far northwestern Illinois and south western Wisconsin we can even include the Detroit area under a wide swath of heavy rainfall potential today\nThis is what this is different because of the culture that's being created by the left and the media on the left this is this is different than an objection to high taxes and and things that are very real\nHere this is a a behavior a pattern of behavior by the left that's being very clearly demonstrated over and over again\nAnd I remember uh other you know intense times that were based on a particular issue ... ah for example after the twenty sixteen election\nWhen when uh a W was talking about uh you know the bridge loan mhm uh\nAnd you had and and and even before that right before the election or you had the the the passion when they talked about a bailout and right on ... but that\nUnification there were people there was an intensity there\nThat existed McCain fined gold you and I were working together on McCain Feingold McCain Kennedy right right or the immigration bill mhm that was a that was a that's when they you know blue the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that when I read that was on a specific topic yeah I did harp\nSame thing heart bright that's hard work are short lived yeah sure Charlotte this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about ... this isn't really about Trump\nAnd reading right here it says but rather than a Wall Street journal\nOr interesting that they write this the same day that you know you do the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while 'cause the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now\nAh and it says you look at you know talks about the cabinet is a part of you know ... isn't part of the whole Trump ism thing\nRight he's he's separate from that can believe that and we've talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said boom wow all of a sudden they are absolutely in in support of of\nAnd in supportive of a cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is it I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to it well except maybe for Bill Kristol\n[laughter] that was the one old out [laughter] except for except for Bill Christ that I haven't seen anything from George Will head it's like ... yeah exactly so you know if they're not part of the ... he he's not some of the right and he's done some Steve Bannon insurgent and\nThe judge is the epitome of the GOP legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spend twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it what I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's surreal is Asian\nFrom\n... from ... I think you have a realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah and don't like where the Republican Party is going where they realized\nUh we got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life this goes beyond a political issue it goes to what\nOne Trump the election it is\nThe it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture where because it's a war on ... it's it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were you know we were never on that never never got about ... we voted for\n... you and I don't practice political I dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us in rallies going ra ra ra whatever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea and what particular issue and why\nAnd we end up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults so see that what do we know now you\n[laughter] [laughter] I mean we don't want to go for air as I read Rick Perry and one of his was one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election ... sixty and you know well uh you know I guess he wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was\nMe [laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that\nThat ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these ... going on and many of them who started making alliances with people on the west or you know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that are never Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really do this is what you really we it wow\nWhat will you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral well we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democrats' side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call\nLook the party isn't perfect\nIf you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or listen to the pocket from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's when you get to this point of the actual election it's a binary choice\nMhm it's a choice between this group and that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one\nAnd I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or is looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh a guy who was it uh I'm trying to think of the the the the person oh yeah yeah it was ... was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary correct yeah\nAh I thought this would because I I I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that and I saw it on social media are a lot of people furious same excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary and and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol\nA and and those that are Jonathan is it ... they're at a ... on Fox News on the\nOn the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives that what came out with the I'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right yeah\nYeah by the way that was after the the the house report that house GOP report the eight hundred page report\nOn been guys yes so I I think that's you know what's happening so again or you look at that and you say wow liberal except for Republicans then I see this Washington Examiner\nOr

to happen but it's a supplemental background check the president agreed to that\nYou know I was watching a Sarah Huckabee Sanders part of the press conference on Wednesday\nYou know and they were wanting her to basically say the president was wrong for mocking you know Dr Ford but then one of the last question actually I think it was the last question from a female reporter well why is it that the president came out and spoke against the abuse and the Catholic Church\nAnd those those who are claiming that they were abused were men but yet he won't defend any women\nI'm paraphrasing but I'm pretty damn close that was the question and she said Sarah Huckabee Sanders answers well wait a minute he\nHe's the one who actually ordered the supplemental background check he's been more than accommodating in this entire process so his comments or the rally or were factual based but he believes that there's nothing to back up the claims\nYou know why because there's nothing to back up the claims the left to once again has created their own little fantasy that these are credible claims but sorry in this setting there or not if you can't find anyone to back it up\nEight six six Ninety

Mitch McConnell saying that all senators will have an opportunity\nTo review the report\n... over the next couple of rice as we go back and you know because the the cloture vote could happen you know late friday so they could take all day Thursday and all day friday a and I suspected that well while he may not allow multiple copies to be made again there's only one single copy\n'em that he could easily say well OK over the next couple of days we'll we'll take our time with it and it won't be the the one hour restriction\nA you know maybe a each of them can go into that room are either as a group or individually and they can you know take their time with it um\nAnd and they likely will do that but I'm I'm guessing they will do that either and one large group or or smaller groups\nEven a in order to to see everything\nUh we'd seen the story or late yesterday that the top FBI a lawyer a James Baker offers explosive testimony on a normal handling of the Russia probe into the Trump campaign uh and that's a Fox News headline from uh yesterday was going through additional\nMaterials you're in the last hour and saw the hill dot com and John Solomon\nOf who I Believe was with the was a circa yeah certainly does yeah when when they when they release the ... they we once were desert or ... or a car to write new ... I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the Pfizer courts rebuke in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of\nOf of twenty Seventeen well his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific of the allegation will get into the the the details of it but here just as the first line congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers that's Perkins Kuwait\nBut but really I mean the approach would likely be because I can see a a rural being enforced is breaking the rules and and it is punishable I don't know what that punishment is um but certainly\nYou don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be working for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate there's a lot of close races and there's no one\nYou know talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place uh in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look\n... and it it's going to be this it's already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday while there are dozens of people thousands of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that have ah have information at potentially they could be witnesses that is one of the words they use to potentially and their story\nOr that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough the the we need of a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to Ford\nOr Kavanaugh there's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to plug it got down to the ... but I I\nDo believe that because the ah Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff ... and not on this but Adam ... who will be talking about\nUh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bombshell\nOr out of a of out of DC uh yesterday about the James Baker [laughter] uh uh apparently telling the house or the house uh uh I don't know which paddling was but uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them\nHe talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got a warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official\nOr at that time which without question shows that politics played apart and he talked to them about\nWhat was going on me talk to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely\nThe wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you and I ask questions over a year and a half ago\nOh is this where this is going and we ... you know what I'm saying is every question that we asked\nAbout where this were what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true\nIt is all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it ... ... ... well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we can say right\nUm that well first of all one of the first questions the big question really\nWas there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration that that a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have it there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for that or Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam Schiff is though Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and other feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah you know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release it all they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nYou know a ... ... ... ah in the in the Senate want to keep\nA this ruling affect that hey we can't be ... every background check we do have every job of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nAnd the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here\nIn the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat this the first two hours the rest of the show go home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ... I really think that\nYou may see that led set right do you go to mark his in Virginia Marcus welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show high [noise]\nHey I just what you were saying Adam Schiff to investigate it I think he's done a leak in the old time he may you know [laughter] I Know\nYes I mean well I don't know he has put right we all believe yes I mean I grew up in a a whole family a Democrat my whole life and even even my father lifelong Democrat my sister my brother in law everybody [noise]\nThey're they're like totally disgusted with what has happened with the Democrat Party [noise] yeah I and I don't think it's going to last I mean they they uh overplay their hand while they went off the rails said\nThey did but keep in mind markers and and and thank you for the call we all share is a\nBig big old there hey my I got two kids in college and a fake socialism greatest say in the world\nOh sure and and that's what's going to keep the insanity alive that's why it's not really there I don't see them coming back from where they are a because this is now the mainstream the mainstream has to follow look [laughter] uh it doesn't matter a who's a protester is or what the causes\nThe party the protestors the far left now leads the party they lead the media they're very active in the media [laughter] they're part of the media you know that's what the ah you know they were saying former CNN officials or or or management uh including Ted Turner\nAre saying they become a CNN's become too political and Jeff Greenfield coming out saying who used to run CNN coming out saying you know it's the these the people at CNN believe they are part of the anti Trump resistance their activists as we've we've known for a while but\nThis is not going to change but it's not going to end they're not going to they may have overplay their hand here but what they'll tell you is we didn't\nDo enough what they'll tell you as we didn't wrap it up enough\nAnd even if he's confirmed this weekend\nAnd we move on from this they'll believe that they're empowered\nBecause they at least got the delay got they got they got the supplemental background check done and all of that they put the pressure on Trump and and they were able to manipulate Trump and the Republicans although it's Jeff Flake and that's that's going to be\nAround it but on the the other side they're going to know\nA that they're in they're in trouble because you because at the Supreme Court at this point than you have a a five four maybe not on everything\nOr maybe not on everything that would be viewed as originalist store construction is doors they call it conservative which would I think is mislabeled ... of it but they will uh uh you know it's going to it they know\nThat if Trump is reelected in twenty twenty that's why I think they're going to go up up the insanity or whether they win or lose any seats or whether they take over the house or whatever there it's going to be pure insanity from now till twenty twenty\nBecause they know that if there's it between now and twenty twenty if there's a Supreme Court a seat that opens\n... we've seen how insane as bad now where they're promoting the fact that there is no presumption of innocence right why this is where they are right now so far where they go who knows but they don't get I Can't\nI don't think they can imagine Trump being president until twenty twenty four because then there's a possibility of more Supreme Court seats that was your so will they moderate their message in order to maybe be able to win\nOr will they just up the insanity for the next two years yeah the uh the Trojan Horse a tactic\nOh we'll just moved to the middle\nA little bit in order to gain power right which is what they used to do that is what I

G. being given all this ah on redacted information from\nThe White House you you know that there's only one reason the inspector general exists that's to look and see if there's any kind of corruption or misdeeds\nStay late in the department of justice accounting irregularities like there's like a pencils home things like that and just you know if you're new to the show what we've always talked about is the Democrats have said Trump polluted with Russians to hack the election mhm that was the initial charge or what have we all find out and we all know now nobody's debating it\nIs it was the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary campaign the paid a law firm ... within paid a opposition research firm fusion GPS who paid a former British spy who got dirt he says from people close you know Russians close to the Kremlin on verified\nThat they then\nTook to use against Donald Trump to defeat his campaign\nWhen that didn't work tried to destroy the legitimacy of the election and use that and verified information that they got from the Russians are to get themselves a Pfizer worn a secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd what we're being told now is that somebody from the FBI met with the law firm who helped initiate the whole thing along with the DNC and the Hillary campaign right before the Pfizer warrant was issued and just weeks before the campaign yeah so hopefully that does I think that explains it all simply as you can explain it\nAnd a number of details coming about uh you know with the Solomon a report that broke on on Wednesday Wednesday evening\nAnd then of course you'd go back to the fact that a Bruce or a at the time a high ranking ah an official at the department of justice his wife worked for fusion GPS\nSo there are connections\nOver the place to this\nAnd a pattern of behavior an activity that right now points in one direction\nAnd that's political motivation\nPlain and simple the question is what if any crimes were committed along the way eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nDrugs with what I told her he wrote a [noise]\n\nCheck out all the latest in news events tracking information jobs and pod cast at red eye radio show dot com that's red eye radio show dot com\nDid you ever look at the stains and your coffee cup and then realized that's exactly what happens to your teeth power swamps is the five minutes solution to get your teeth white without visiting the dentist\nThis is John Green the c._e._o. of Paris robs and if your teeth or Spain for coffee tea or smoking all it takes five minutes with power swabs in five\nMinutes you'll see an average of two shades wider teeth and in Seventy\nSix shapes its clinically proven to white natural teeth as well as caps Anthony ers the secret is it to the church and that was developed by Dr Martin ... that live stains off of your teeth best of all there is no matter if you strip search trees that you have to leave in your mouth for an hour just rub your teeth for five minutes and you're done to try parents swabs risk free call one eight hundred\nSix seven nine o nine six nine that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nI guarantee you a bright white smile will have your friends talking about how great you look try at risk free today one eight hundred\nSix seven nine o nine six nine that's one eight hundred six seven eight nine ... nine six nine\nHey if you're driving right now and you'd like to read the informative and entertaining content found in the current September October issue of road teen magazine or if you'd like to listen that's right I\nAnd I said listen as a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you will listen up\nFor starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of vote your drivers is now available for free as an F.

Supreme Court from this point forward\n[laughter] they're going to claim he's part is in and try and demand that he recused himself or staying for many votes\nMay have you with anything they want to but they they don't they can do\nHe's the no it's not he's the only person that can recused himself\n[noise] okay yeah they can't scream that\nWell they they ... ... email us ... screaming all day long but they'll get nowhere can't get anywhere with it okay 'cause I've heard lawyers you know try and no show that judges should recused themselves oh yesterday on our well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated then we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah oh I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases where we've even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves a I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I don't remember I\nCan't wait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they were seated on the ... got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argued a case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if\nIt's or or are there for example they're arguing the case of deals with the law you know with the company and their wife works for the company ... and writes for the economy at that point to have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them and that's not going to hold any water\nYeah you remember when they talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process uh the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like okay [laughter]\nWhere she would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that Tom putting is indirectly working with my brother's company and and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family but\nThe ... the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere's a great deal of respect by everyone that seem to be on the court right now for the process\nNot that they make a decision that we should always agree with in fact a a while I can think of free that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but we can talk about that\nBut the procedure on procedural issues\nAll of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court have a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case uh it is not it is not driven like the social media world of today\nAt the Supreme Court in terms of procedure\nNow the hearings often have these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of them and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context or they did that with Scalia um but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nAnd ... and but I I think can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the federal judges to begin with is not the social media world that I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that it's not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great ... great aunt monies to make that their ... their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe\nAbout the process of cabinet is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because that means\nThat door this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate and two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three oh two secret\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some contempt came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the claim came out the what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh to accept that they found that they couldn't find any anyone would first hand knowledge of the event or the claims\nThen they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate\nWell they know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what we're looking at ... here's\nHere's the point that nobody's talked about\nWith all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are uncorroborated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated I ordered to defeat somebody\nAnd never get known to the public eye and the only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is gonna be the exception to the rural ... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete rules the Senate complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority\nThat is a more construction is well journalists court and then\nLearning of this this rule now it puts it all into prospect she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information\nTo the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would have been in the official thrilled to report and you wouldn't hear about\nIt when it would have never it would've you know that's the ... when you think about that that's the whole point nobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not that would not have been able to cooperate and then at that point\nIt died just like probably the thousands of other allegation yes and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices over the decades\nAnd that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now what makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically and why weren't the her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nNow you know why Lindsey Graham was

may have his opinions of what he wants day to day on do you know what we should do with immigration or a help our welfare should go or what taxes should be\nBut on the constitution there used to be

can willfully even gleefully destroy a man as distinguished us Brett Kavanaugh they can and will do it to any conservative who threatens their grip on power sure\nRepublicans are well aware of Mr

think about the whole Russia investigation over the last of a couple of years a this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony uh yesterday by a\nUh you know Well hi FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hill dot com John Solomon or has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Cooley the Democratic National Committee is private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do it within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes\nWhat I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee in Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm Perkins ... law firm ... who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day and verified in order\nTo uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy\nOf his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that dossier promote we know was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that\nThe FBI lead counsel met with the law firm Perkins too we\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign we've gotten to the law firm they were with the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers right\nAnd I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question the the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm\nThat would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that is part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI do as they say well as well as he says to talk about the allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election but it was\nLawyers meeting with lawyers right why why not an agent asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys meeting\nSo former FBI general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS\nWho then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compile the dusty a oven cooperated Ron ... alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed or by both testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the size of court in October of twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide that Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday sources declined to the ...\nSources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins could we law firm and the FBI we bought the state of the ... I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah and you can do a capital a season though you could do probably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you can include us in the group that was first in asking this so many of the important questions on this and when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack and or changed because of change then to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and then in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump on verified\nInformation still today is\nHeld by the way if it's an verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's false ... ad ride over after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that\nIt was to destroy the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and ... well faking it as intelligence instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they still make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nThe way to the whole Pfizer court ... everybody knows it's true\nI don't know of anybody decide or or that is\nA it tried to even debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circa news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out\nUm and what was going on to the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem with\nHaving something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active Mueller and his team are still working which means it's still\nRelevant even though right now and the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario where\nDo you think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story start falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's right a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a mill cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere mhm and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats did what Stein Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name secret yes", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Washington", "day": "06"}
