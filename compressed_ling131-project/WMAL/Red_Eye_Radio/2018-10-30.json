this is from MSN dot com Democrats were sounding growing alarms and the final push before the midterm elections that the party lacks the message it needs to combat President Trump and went back democratic majorities in Congress as\nWe haven't had a real message since the last presidential elections so why change now said democratic strategist Chris ... we had no message and twenty sixteen we had no message in between\nYou had no message going into this election you have to give people a reason to vote for you not a reason just to vote against someone else\nDemocrats think they have a good chance of retaking the house majority despite problems given the fact that they're voting base is fired up\nOr to send a message to Trump polls have tightened however and there is recognition that Trump has started to fire up his own base the narrow path the Democrats won saw for the Senate majority has largely disappeared in terms of the Democratic party having even a semblance of a message it's just not there\nThat's the reason this election is going to be unpredictable said ... nobody should be surprised if it's a good night or a bad night [noise]\nUh Democrats found a winning formula in two thousand six when they captured both chambers with the promises to champion a series of specific policy proposals\nRaw early the following year including the minimum wage hike and cuts in

campaign arm said his party needs to be more clear in his message for the country\n[noise] ah I don't want to say we did everything right you know six but we had a six in oh six agenda a set of ideals are that are very clear\nA second democratic strategist that Emanuel makes a great point I couldn't tell you exactly what we stand for no so in that sense I think Romney's right at least back then we had a target we knew we needed to do to get there I can say the same now and that's troubling\nThey talk about democratic leaders are quick to reject that the notion because they've talked about health care costs and boosting wages and fighting government corruption by the way to end fighting government corruption if there isn't a more useless campaign issue\nTo go on ... by the way any government corruption when you think of a government corruption for the Democrats but would you think of\nIf I write for a Democrat if you're a Democrat I mean you're well if you're an American ride to Democrat or Republican Russian collusion right and we know it was the Democrats who colluded with the Russians not the\nNot the not the Republicans there's no evidence of it mhm and any government corruption that you could look at right now and I don't know they claim they're running on on corruption I don't know where I haven't seen an ad on corruption\nBut if I one thing but if they could promote if they wanted to get away ... or if they wanted to help eliminate any type of corruption or a wrongdoing and the process is a support voter id\nCertainly they're pressing for that right yeah I think they're talking government ... right I Know but you start with the idea that because that's where it comes you know you come down to all the voter fraud situations and you often have officials that are involved in\nSo but the biggest my my point was the biggest ...\nThe biggest question on corruption is the Obama administration and the FBI and the department of justice and our intelligence agencies it is on the uh the size of course rebuke in the Obama administration for violating the rights of American citizens when it comes to secret warns those are the things that we used to view\nThe ... but when I say we [laughter] I met we all but specifically liberals used to care about\nYou know up until about a month ago yeah ... well they cared about that since Trump spinning off well no I mean the ... if you think about the Russian collusion thing they cared about that all about among right All right then it disappeared\nHaven't heard anything on it right I mean they're not campaigning on on any of that now\nIt's that Trump is responsible for uh the suspicious packages\nAre and the synagogue shooting and the most evil and heinous acts that's an ... when the glare of the

amazing how people who believe\nThat overheated political rhetoric causes mass murder compare their opponents to Nazis without hesitation yeah I'll expand on that it's amazing how people who believe that overheated political rhetoric causes mass murder compare their opponents to Nazis and ISIS without hesitation yeah\nAbout it but the ones that are trying to make that point are the ones without the most out just accusations\nAgainst their opponents the ultimate being that an incoming president colluded with the Russians to hack the election uh-huh and they pounded that year in and year out\nYou know it's ah when when you look at it and we just to you know talked about you know the whole lock her up thing with Hillary Clinton and how the Democrats have jumped on that same see how in civil he is this is how radical they are they're saying lock her up lock her well and we just explain why\nBut we read earlier the to\nHave the analysis of the Democrats running on health care increased wages and getting rid of government corruption white admitted they only what's the what is the only government corruption that we know of what is the the the biggest ally looked into the living room\nOf government corruption many people believe it's the Hillary absolutely broke the law and was not prosecuted because of it\nIt's ... it's the entire Russian collusion as we're learning more it's the allegation from the Democrats over and over again that this president ... go you know a a as in their own words\nAre committed treason because he colluded with the Russians to hack\nThe election that it was changed the outcome of the election and what we learned in that time in that time we ... we learned it is the opposite that it was the Democrats and the Hillary campaign\nThat actually paid money to a law firm that funneled that money to an opposition research firm which funnel that money to a former British spy who got on verified information that he claims unverified still to this day on true I think it's safe now\nSince there's never been any evidence in uh over two and a half years of investigation\nA of a false information from people close to the Kremlin\nThat Donald Trump did all these heinous things that they used to try they wanted to destroy his campaign\nThat Donald Trump did all these heinous things that they used to try they wanted to destroy\nHis campaign when they couldn't do it they try to destroy the legitimacy of a presidential election in twenty sixteen\nThey also took that information and used it to get a secret warned against the opposition parties campaign you want corrupt possible corruption that's corruption\nThe out as absolute ... how do you debate something like that how you debate those facts when it's documented\nFor

especially\nAh the tragic shooting at Santa got I I just think that it's\nIt's something where they they're on full display a by the way they don't believe they're wrong for doing it\nYou know she she made this comparison to ISIS and made this absurd statement because she believes she's right not because she's trying to get attention not because of anything else\nShe believes it was the right thing to say and that people agree with her on it that it's respond civil\nTo say that she believes in fact it's hurt responsibility to point out what is clearly\nBlatantly falls\nBut she thinks it's right\nOr looking here at some of the polling from rash person which might affect the election next week more voters now commend President Trump\nFor his economic leadership butter less impressed by his performance when it comes to foreign affairs that's good news though for Republicans face you know election with voters said Trump and the economy are the big issues the latest rash some reports\nNational television and online survey finds at fifty one percent of likely us voters give the president good or excellent marks for handling the economy thirty three percent still write his performance in this area as poor\nTrump's economic positives continue to rise from thirty nine percent in August of last year now to a a fifty one percent forty nine percent gave his economic ... gave his economic of a performance\nGood or excellent marks for months ago when it comes to foreign policy forty five percent of voters said Trump is doing a good or excellent job down slightly from forty seven percent in June\nForty four percent consider his performance poor bought\nThe cab you out here just six percent rate national security\nOur top voting issue right so it's really not an issue that's the point that I was going to make our said as long as\nWe're not we're as long as we're not at a war you know new a new war people don't care right uh the we see a a survey this is what does this here the president's job approval rating\nHas been in the high forties uh for most days in recent months speaking at a high up fifty one percent two weeks ago Trump's approval is tracking higher than President Obama's at this stage in the president's seat on the Rasmussen poll\nPredictably eighty eight percent of Republicans think Trump is doing a good or excellent job of handling the economy but only Nineteen percent of Democrats agree well eighty percent of the GOP voters give positive remarks the president\nAnd his handling of foreign policy Seventy seven percent of the Democrats say he is doing a poor job\nAmong voters not affiliated with either major party fifty one percent said Trump is doing a good or excellent job\nOn the economy but only forty three percent feel that way on a foreign policy the older the voter the more strongly they approve\nOf the president's job performance when it comes to both the economy and foreign policy well black unemployment is at a historic low blacks are much more critical of the president's economic performance than whites and other minority voters blacks are similarly unimpressed by the handling of his foreign policy\nEconomic and consumer confidence already is at near record highs is moving up again in the latest Rasmussen consumer spending update now that's interesting to say that when it comes to economic things because I saw Rasmussen uh that uh he released a few hours ago the president's latest job approval rating\nAnd here's what he writes Trump approvals today back and fifty percent black voter approval at record high\n[laughter] while we were talking about the economic can inform but\nToday back and fifty percent black voter approval at record high\n[laughter] while we were talking about the economic and inform but overall they say Trump's black approval right now I'm at a record high yeah\nWell and and I I think right now you're seeing again everyday people this this is the question as it is with every election what is what is what are the American people thinking right but but but really we're not talking about real things we're not talking about\nI mean in part on the positive side that's the last caller pointed out you know he focuses on the winning which which I I Would assume we didn't get to ask them but I Would assume it would include the economy things that are going on the positive things that are going on with the economy\nBut but really it's it's not about that what drives the election right now if you think about it\nBecause there were conservatives before Kavanaugh there were conservatives that clearly recognized the positives and the economy but they're still never truckers\nThey're still right now maybe going to sit on the sidelines for a while\nI ... a number of them can't quantify it but let's just I think it's safe to say there were a number of that right so there's that that part of the Republican Party that after Kavanaugh looked at it and said I'm OK the game has changed\nAnd now it really is about building this wall around the constitution as I've been saying\nIt is about protecting the things that are very real and we can have our inhouse discussions on what to do here what to do their terror of no terrorists by the way we're the original ...\nAll of that can be discussed internally no problem we can have those very real debates on very real issues with no issues going forward because right now\nThe the the game has to be the end game must be protecting the constitution because the process is being with old it was it was all but shredded in terms of the confirmation process uh Brett Kavanaugh\nAh they were given way too much leeway but guess what ultimately it works\nI think to the benefit I don't know if it will actually show that in the house of if it will mean a win for the Republicans in the house but it showed enough to bring the Republican Party together like I've never seen it\nIn a one thing I just want to bring up here 'cause we're talking about the different you know challenges out there you're talking about you know never Trump or whatever you know maybe staying at home and I was thinking of a local story here you heard that the Dallas Morning news indoors a better or ... and they claim you know you hear the conservative\nThe conservative Dallas Morning news a conservative Dallas Morning news with the conservative Dallas Morning news yeah there's no way that you can be a conservative and support paid or work number Ted Cruz up though you're not a conservative and I started thinking when I saw that story to begin with\nHow many think about this in the media\nThere seems to be what Jennifer Rubin for example I'm a Republican conservative though you're not you're not a Republican conservative she's she's a liberal or a Max Boot who is the the vote for ... I could talk ... former conservative columnist to see the picture of him with Stormy Daniels and the other day yeah like it's like wait a minute\n[laughter] yeah nice conserve your Stormy Daniels any posted a picture of him with Stormy Daniels like proudly on on uh on on a a a Twitter ... but it's just like it was most bizarre thing in the world and and you look at other\nYou know you look at a a a um a Bill Kristol ... ah who just has lost to John Case it\nOr who just you know completely have shown that they're not conservatives but you've got in in the media you have a a lot of different people who are claiming that there are conservatives and they're speaking for the conservative movement but they're not conservatives anymore and I don't mean because they're not supporting Trump\nI'm Talking about there any allergy has actually changed who they support actually changes you can sit there and say maybe I don't like Donald ... I don't like Donald Trump but I don't like the fact the cruise now is with Donald Trump and so I'm not going to vote for it\nTo say you're voting for ... because because the ... the Ted Cruz in conservatism has failed you is the most bizarre thing on the planet you couldn't possibly say it makes no critical thinking sense at all year not a conservative why\nBecause as a conservative ... what is the most important thing and let's go to the late Andrew Breitbart who before he died was on our show\nAnd we asked him you know why should people vote for Romney back in twenty twelve Supreme Court\nYou know if Trump was done if Trump was done today\nI was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like\nTrump was done if Trump was done today\nI'd be happy I was I said that to a friend over the weekend or because they were like okay but but but the work's not even he's not able to get work done because then I said no he's he's got a lot and I said but but imagine even the tax\nCuts didn't get done I'd like to imagine that 'cause now I'm paying more in taxes let me let me a method that would you please [laughter] um [laughter]\nBut imagine that the you know there were a number of things and and imagine even that the economy ... weren't growing as fast a ... and they didn't want to be happy ... there are a number of things here and again we don't\nIt's not the we never cheer the endgame you and I are ... the rates is never finished because there are so many things to do\nBut it's what we're looking at right now\nAnd capital\nI I can I can sleep go

yesterday that the media was talking about the fact that you know the president's still device if he goes after his political opponents or we need unity\nEvery president calls for unity zero presidents presidents get unity go out to go any further with it\nNever happened every president calls for unity every person calls for unity and then they go out and they do what\nThey express what they believe and they're roughly half the people agree and half the people disagree as soon as you have an opinion you had created a divisive atmosphere how stupid are we\nHow stupid is the media rather not stupid there\nThey believe that it gets to their advantage but every politician calls for unity and as soon as you open your mouth and say here's what I'm going to do a significant portion of the population disagrees with you [laughter] it is impossible for a politician\nTo create unity in a country\nCan we move on now\nAre we going to are we going to continue living as fairy tale

L.\nWashington comes to talk [noise]\nMain\nRadio he is our hunting and I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety read I was just looking at a Fox News article from Newt Gingrich\nA and remember they contract with America that that he'd come up with a he's talking about the fact that they should have come up with because he's talking about now proposed Republican pledge on on on healthcare you and I talked about this long time ago that the Republicans\nIf they lose and remember health care's one believing issues out there right underneath the economy if they lose part of it is their fault for not oh yeah solving the problem of health care and not going in with a plan for it and he talks about you know a a a pledge that you know that that the ... that ah they should take\nA and there's ten different points to the the pledge and then what would they do\nSo they should take a and there's ten different points to the the pledge and then what would they do\nTowards a better future and then he goes on to the Republican accomplishments and they go to the accomplishments [noise]\nYou know including eliminating the Obamacare individual mandate\nUh the uh uh six billion new to fight opioid epidemic in the past the right to try legislation passes stored VA mission\nOr as the Trump Administration providing more affordable health care options for Americans through association health care plans and short term limited to ration plans so they go through that there's ten different ones there then they say the Republican promises for additional improvements\nIf the American people re elect Republicans to a majority in the house and Senate we pledge to enact a series of practical in specific changes based on what works in the public and private sectors to build a better healthcare system the system will keep people healthy and provide effective treatments and economic security for those who get sick\nThese legislative changes will and they go to the pre existing condition which really goes back to the block grant right\nWe do we do so by committing the resources necessary for states to try new approaches like high risk pools and reinsurance so everyone regardless of medical history has access to affordable insurance but again it goes to the states that states make a decision as to what they wish to do\nAnd further reduce the cost of prescription drugs by requiring additional transparency and accountability across the entire prescription drugs supply chain\nA lower premiums for individuals and small businesses by eliminating the health insurance tax\nReducing Washington's mandates of limited choices the drive a cause for insurance strengthen Medicare by protecting Medicare part D patients from excessive out of pocket costs maximize medical innovation that go through that but basically go through all the things that they should that they should actually do this has been a failure of the Republican Party completely\nThere is something that probably Ryan\nShould should have been talking about on a consistent basis there should have been a marketing plan for this with massive television ads leading up to the election that if you will like this ... this is our plan this is our contract ... and Newt Gingrich bringing it up and this was two days ago it's too late oh yeah yeah it sounds\nLike it's not going to work uh now we're inside of a week first of all it's because a Newt Gingrich is is only going to ... no one is going to uh pay attention to Newt except for the choir\nUm because that's who he's preaching to but you're right with a ... Paul Ryan at the beginning of this year we talked about twenty sixteenth although they were going to do away with with Obamacare we're going to do away with Obamacare we will\nDo away with Obamacare and then by the time they got there the sentiment by the rank and file a changed and it was like okay well we'll do away with the some of the\nObama Care and then they finally got to\nThe individual mandate which of course then under the funding mechanism and then forced them eventually will force them to pay for it in another way premiums going up all of the ... which is exactly what we're saying\nAnd we we talked about that disconnect between twenty sixteen\nAnd the end of last year\n[noise] now you have this this whole new cycle and and the whole new opportunity to essentially launch the new plan based on what you do about the public sentiment and they do know what then\nWhy wouldn't you do that to say if you give us if if if if we are in charge this is what we want to do and go at a point by point as Newt Gingrich to\nAn end and it should have been it should've been Ryan and the president yeah this is what we're going to do look it isn't done yet and you promote the daylights out of it by because it's one of the top issues than Americans\nCare of all because here's what I Would say too is that there's nothing wrong with saying look the the set of it by the American people is is shifting on health care and this uh this is where the sentiment of the American people is right now\nThis is what they're telling us this is what they want and this is the plan we believe will work\nYou don't necessarily have to go back and apologize for not getting it done because the American people don't care that you didn't get it done but what you do have to do what you are charged with now is because you know you break it you pay for it\nWhat you're going to have to do now is put together a plan a very realistic plan and put it in front of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich is one thing\nThe party didn't have any desire to do that\nOne of the American people but that's that's not happening I mean Newt Gingrich was one thing\nThe party didn't have well\nAny desire to do that again ... because you saw this was a failure of the Republican I and we said this by the way and we got criticism ... we are criticism we got criticism when we said they're not repealing Obamacare right stop saying that we are we got criticism and guess what we were right they weren't repealing Obamacare but they just they were what were they were doing was were pulling what\nThe mandate but the actual benefit state which means somebody has to pay for it which was taxpayer money through the back and an increase in premiums but you didn't solve any of the problems right\nAnd so you should have focused on solving the problems immediately there should have been the president and and and this is why we have said that we know that people love the rhetoric but it's about winning and it's about getting things\nIt's about getting things done more to the way that we wish to get things done so we don't end up with a Medicare for all ...\nSo we don't have a monopoly running our health care system of government monopoly running our healthcare system and this is what the Republicans were supposed to be fighting for\nAnd they did not do this they did not do it and we criticized President Trump from the very beginning for not taking a stand on repealing Obamacare but just saying well just sent me whatever and I'll sign right\nBecause the president has shown that when he sticks by something\nLike the corporate and individual tax cuts and he keeps promoting it any keeps fighting in a lot of people have been told us the last couple of weeks the weather like about the president that he's fight fight fight fight fight fight fight the fight has to be more than just rhetorical\nYou've got to take the hardy shoes and one of the hardest issues out there is health care\nAnd and I I've heard the point made by pundits that well you know there are things that ... that he clearly understands that are within his wheelhouse like taxes because he's a businessman what you can not that you want to oversimplify healthcare but one of the main concerns\nThe number one thing that this president did as a candidate was to what ... well acknowledged the problem right I mean overall yeah but I did but\nThat's one of the problems deregulation a no Donald Jean what the problem is with health care regulations part of the ... well yes regulation is the is the problem you have the right now the burden on employers and hospitals\nThat's the problem you have I mean how many different items but you don't even have to get that involved this president easily\nCould point at it and say there are too many the cost of health care going up\nAs a result of I don't know an aging society or something like that is one thing that's not something the government is necessarily going to be able to Kirk\nWhat they can do is get in front of the regulation and that regulation right now is choking in hospitals it's choking employers and as a result who was it that pays\nAnd so you ... and ... and ... and and when he got out and in payments to the insurance company have\nUs and and and the the president pointing that out house that's not too difficult\nYou know I've seen those pundits make that case before that well that really wasn't in his wheel house so he was leaving that up to other people know recognizing the the unnecessary skyrocketing costs of health care\nIs well within this we'll ...\n... unless in his mind he believes in Medicare for all\nRight well and then that case he's going to have to start talking about yeah 'cause otherwise you're not going to get anything done\nBecause if that's what you thought then you should have brought that up already mhm\nBut this is just this is a failure of Republicans on the administration for not you know if if they if they lose the house that is one of the reasons oh yeah no doubt it because they ... they said okay let's just ignore held\nLet's pretend we got rid of Obamacare when we really didn't mhm 'cause that was the cry and then the president finally had to admit no well no we didn't get rid of all of a bomb and care\nBut I mean but that's ... by the way that is part of the the you know you're not talking about people not wanting bay that's part of the problem we have with the right we said look he didn't get rid of Obamacare yes I did yes he did no we didn't know and people would argue with this why because they just wanted to believe what they wanted to believe in the facts didn't matter in that\nBecause the heavy costs is coming from the regulation that are still in place the hospitals and employers and by what the you know those those policies and plans have to cover\nThose those policies and plants have to cover\nWe're still paying the costs yeah H and we consider to matter what age six Ninety red eye [noise]", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington", "day": "30"}
