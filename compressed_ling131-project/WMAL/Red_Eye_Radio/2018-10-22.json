the the big thing really uh here we got in rancho rain everything as as you know around where I live and if you've ever flown into Texas and error into Dallas or into Texas and you see all the lakes are all manmade and\nThe number one reason is for flood control number two reason for water and the number three reason\nFor recreation but my leg that was sixteen feet three years ago and the horrible floods which really closed down the lake for year is almost twelve feet over there right now I mean it's it's closed my leg that that I live on his clothes completely again so we had just\nMassive brains or somebody told me we have like twenty six inches of rain since the beginning of September here in Texas\nThat I got laid off that the some some close to that um and it's it is unbelievable the the uh the amount of rain we we ended up getting a break over the weekend this past weekend but uh it's not even starting to dry out for the most part I mean there's just no real dry and potential here and this is going to be one of those\nFalls that apparently we're going to have what are the normal a situation a going forward in the fall and winter\nWe really went from summer to uh Texas winter period of a day on\nMonday and Tuesday of last week our first couple of days on vacation before it was in the forties for the high I cranked up my fire plays voted I you know and I was like you know I don't really feel bad about it on Wednesday I was like OK I'm ready for the rain to be done now I was done resting I was I was becoming restless\nOr to go outside so I was like yeah I'm ready for the rain to be done\nBut uh we kept getting rain and you know the temperatures moderated\nYou know how bad the weather was ... I never picked up a golf club once my good me now is not one of my goodness have not even swung a golf and I got a big argument coming up yeah the independent Bob Dole all by the way I knew was sort of an independent Bob just\nCalled me a few times just ranting I Begin was on vacation he just ranting and raving Elizabeth Warren thing just sent him into outer space\nYeah he's just like this is just well they they they believe that's a good thing to do\nBut they believe that this is a good tactic would you and I just kind of just in general if you just look at the tactics right now the leftist using I mean politically we're not talking about the moms in restaurants we're not talking about you know the the the rank and file with the protesters talking about the people holding off it yeah\nTheir political tactics I mean there may this is their mainstream political tactic and they believe stuff like this is going to work\nAnd and that's and you and I made sure that before it went on vacation when we were talking about cabinet and to understand this is the mainstream now yeah ours is the Democrat leadership in this country because we'll always get calls from people saying well this isn't the average Democrat\nAge the average Democrat now representing new sure in Congress and in the Senate right\nThis is the standard and we'll get to Elizabeth Warren too and uh the the three big problems that she by the way they want their uh down just to to three was one of the things I I Love was uh I I never believed in white privilege until Elizabeth Warren\nA white person makes the claim yes she's Native American you all white privilege that white privilege fried rice or cultural appropriation\nYeah right I and and again they believe they're on the right track\nI Know it just it's just unbelievable so we'll get to that to the polls everything else you got a great show ... for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nSet to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region immigrants\nFor cobra electronic here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there is a low pressure system and in the Pacific there's a low pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the southern Sierra is an southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that pretty sick at the end of last week the winter weather forecast from the climate Prediction Center was issued\nAnd it looks like they had that meaning they met all weekend about it [noise] okay we can get up and walk out which ultimately they did or during the a committee vote on on on Capitol\nYou know and that you had come out Harris going outside and doing the press thing and all that but it wasn't that wasn't so much the ... that was like the protest after they are they still voted yet and they still voted so there wasn't affected really anything you know it it will show but\nBut they had the meeting that first weekend they had that meeting\nWill just get up and walk out\nThis is this ... this is a mainstream Democrats today\nThis this is not the protesters and we've talked about how the protesters ... lead the party\nThey lead the party Bailey the call for the party but how many groups how many different causes and different protest groups are there this is why they have no direction because they're in every direction and it's it's it's crazy\nAnd then then I guess the the other point was so Elizabeth Warren then does DNA matter\n[noise] right right\nDoes it does is destroyed transgender as if DNA matters because remember the the the next thing is as as we all know uh we we've gone through the whole trans racial thing than the left just starting to embrace ... remember you're talking about Elizabeth Warren who was [laughter] before this one of the leading liberal icons\nSocialist icons social justice warrior ... who broke a ton of social justice warrior rules and regulations [laughter] number one you were saying the DNA matters does it does so DNA matters across the board that ... that it matters for uh your your sexuality it matters for your gender huh\nThat writers for your race huh right is is that the\nIs that the whole point or or does it not in okay what's the determining factor of what you are then what is the what is the [laughter] where does that decimal point go what is the what is the fraction that indicates that you are a particular ethnicity just great stop\nWell and if I were doing a debate with her on stage I Would say a former President Obama said race is just a social construct yes do you agree\n[laughter] and people forget about that because again what you know if that when a President Obama\n... just before he left office I Believe that was the was it the letter or a New Yorker I forgot what I think it was ... he did a a an interview with\nAnd they asked him you know why do you say that you're black when you know there are members right next mixed race some and he said because I've come to know I've I've come to realize that race is a social construct it's what you think you are ... so is that it now is that done now\nHas a ... moved on because when when you look at it there were so many rules of the social justice warrior that Elizabeth Warren broke and they were completely quiet mhm totally silent ... everything from cultural appropriation\nTo the fact that race apparently is no longer a social construct it has something to do with DNA that's\nWhy are you using science [laughter] since the war I met [laughter] remember when Ben Shapiro brought up science on a on the doctor drew show he was threatened with violence\nSo you can't bring up science that's wrong but see this is this is the madness of the left because there are so many different directions how do you know which one is the ...\nArab here's here's the thing when Trump says something the majority of what Trump says that they criticize in fact check this off the cuff Mm right it's it's an opinion or just the thought that he just boom records out right and and and the insanity of the left\nWhich is I'm going to call them the whole my beer party from now on\nCars whatever Trump does like ... hold my beer I [laughter] you think that the ball watch what I'm going to say it's actually premeditated um thought out yes no planets\nThat are trying they're trying to prove them wrong on something that she didn't give a half a second to he didn't give one one hundred and twenty fourth of a second [laughter] my my favorite was the hot water over one\nOne hundred and twenty fours of a second [laughter] my\nMy favorite was the [laughter] water over one hundred and twenty fours yeah [laughter] maybe seal and it was a huge tied with a gun [laughter]\nWe're ... and the swimming pool it's you know ... that's ... it really is the um that's the madness because they believe that something\nThat's going to win for them\nLook in her state in terms of you know her Senate seat yeah she's pretty sick like Dick Durbin he can get away with saying and doing a lot of crazy things he's safe as long as he wants to that seat but at least for the time being you want to enter the arena and twenty twenty\nFor the big house well but by the way not prison the White House I mean that but [laughter]\nAlthough although Hillary was a contender for both um [laughter] we do you have to get up on that stage and you have to bring down out look again\nYou know those um those blue states where they're safe they can they can do the crazier things they can do the protester type attitude but do that up on stage you know we talked about this the few months ago when we were talking about what the the the pool of contenders in the primary season and twenty twenty will look like right\nThere each going to have the top each other on how much they hate Trump\nThat will be gold number one you've got to show your anger and you've got to show how much you so the person who hates Trump more\nIn terms of the perception by the voter or the rank and file Democrats might get the nomination because that's the goal number one for them so but in order to do that they have to get up on that debate stage during that primary season\nAnd that's what they have to do they have to do the crazier and crazier and crazier because no longer can you have\nA debate no longer can you have a real discussion because what are they going to say well the economy is suffering Mm as long as it holds between now and twenty twenty no\nA jobs we need more jobs ... we haven't finding enough people right now [noise] um so the what are you going to do well you have it has to be about the hatred for Trump's so you're going to have to display you know the one who hates the most is gonna win ...\nOr where it's going that we thought the only way that they could go if they were going to go more or less which is we're offering you everything for free\nYes yeah and that I mean that's ... ... and that we are the other\nDay we yeah we do we we do have a fascist mindset and we do is to control\nA a lot a lot of things we do believe in the intimidation\nUh uh uh the tactics out there we don't believe in the constitution of the United states right by the way it's become clear and we brought this up a few years ago and we were amazed\nAt the very little response so we got from Democrats on this front where we said look they don't really believe in the constitution we don't know that they don't they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the cars that by the way that gain ground overhear vacation than the Senate has to go to the electoral college the electoral college just to go to\nThe Senate has to go and what they what they may not realize it but that's when you get into not carrying that belief get you to the point of\nNot caring about individual rights because that's why the Senate exist that's why the electoral college or you know it exists because we're not a direct democracy were republic or constitutional Republican or a public why to protect individual rights that\nThe Democrats and the ACLU used to care about right but now as we know they do right and so you know that's where you've got to we really don't believe in America\nAnd so in order to get you to vote for us we'll give you as much free stuff as possible to me that's actually what the Democrats round\nAnd uh I you're you're spot on and but the problem there is what\nCNN Jake Tapper and Chris Cuomo asking tough questions from Ocasio Cortez and ... you know separate interviews okay well how do you pay for it how do you pay for it but but but beyond that forget about the media asking wasn't so tough but they did ask the questions\nIf you're Hillary and you get back in and twenty twenty\nThe it used to be the boiling the frogs slowly right okay we'll give you a little more free stuff and then we'll a little more free stuff\nYou've got to go full on because you have Gillum and Florida promising world oh Casio\nCortez promising to world Bernie's been promising the world\nCan all Harris now over the last couple of days yeah you know saying okay\nLet's give everybody a let's let's give people six thousand dollars a year that's the starting bright right let's just give cash to people and and so uh so we're to the the the the free cash free health care and free college yeah\nSand and they know they can't pay for it and the American voter knows they can't pay for it but\nFree health care and free college yeah\nAnd they know they can't pay for it\nAnd the American voter knows they can't pay for it\nBut how how do you do it if you're Hillary and you try and put up a plan of a little more free stuff no you've got to go full on like the rest of 'em dead somebody

normally in the mid term you're going to have the party in power like the Republicans yeah they're going to lose seats Mm I'd that's what that's what normally happens\nAh in in a case like this uh of course we live in unique times and every election is completely and totally unique I look at what the Republicans have right now ...\n... what's the Brits WMA a Washington have\nRight now the economy right the economy is doing the uh the economy's doing good uh and that is huge\nYou have the cabinet hearings where America has seen\nThat there are major major things that are important to many Americans that they now understand that the Democrats do not believe in and we talked about the cabinet forget about the Supreme Court ... what it showed was that depending on their politics\nThat the Democrats do not believe in a presumption of innocence right or the mindset of due process and we sort of back at that and you know at that time a few weeks ago\nSo the ... look on we understand that when it comes to a lot of things out there on the for example on the the ... of separation of powers and the three branches of government and the rights that are included in the first amendment to the constitution\nOf the majority of Americans can't tell you what they are\nBut\nYou look at what is ingrained in our culture\nAnd one of the reasons is the TV load the TV shows on lawyers all the way back to Perry Mason or the presumption\nAnd one of the reasons is the TV ... the TV shows on lawyers all the way back to Perry Mason or the presumption of innocence and due process the mindset of due process is ingrained into every single American\nSo we saw that with Kavanaugh and we saw\nThe reaction of\nMany people realizing that not the fringe of the Democratic party but the mainstream of the Democratic party has now jumped off the cliff and\nBecause until I think Kavanaugh\nIllegal immigration was still the number one issue of concern for Americans and as you said\nIf there's a conspiracy out there in our regional meeting from it in order to get to build the wall right Trump is funded this whole thing because if I got to have a lot of conspiracy theory that did because boom\nThey

so now we know the DNC will be working to make sure that of course she's ushered in you know make it seem like Bernie is really catching fire but not really [laughter] like we learned it's what's he's

Harris you've got are probably not Elizabeth Warren [noise]\n[laughter] now but you've got you're going to have a field that is going to be greater than it was what did they have three three and a half candidates go up against Trump\nNo but if you in their primary or a [laughter] ... well build me a heck of a lot more I I I well I don't know I I I'm not going to you know you\nYou have to and you said this earlier it's going to be\nEither who hates Trump more than a combination of who hates Trump more and we're going to give you everything right and so right now the base level for the Democrats and bend and Kamala Harris set it over the weekend or of last week\nWhen she came up again with her guaranteed in a ... plan yeah of six thousand dollars was one of the figures that was thrown out so now it's\n... well ... praises income yeah first is get rid of the the tax cuts right they act taxes would have to go up there in order to pay for it even though they ... it wouldn't pay for the six thousand dollars and but six thousand dollars what any American the mix under a hundred thousand something like that what it was I\nI'm a but a ... is six thousand they're free healthcare completely Medicare per hour where you pay nothing ... there's no deductible there is nothing mhm\nWhich ah by the way uh I thought the president had the best response for that before we went on vacation when he said oh good screw with people that that right because what's going to happen right you you you you think you're going to Medicare for all you can just going to enter a screen all people because they're not enough money for the old people that have put in for Medicare that we can't pay for Medicaid for his album right\nUh but uh you know so you have you have that and free college free college free health care free money mhm and we hate Trump and really if you want to look at it there was nowhere else for them to go\nBack in ... we already know what twenty twenty is going to be yeah\nYep I age because there has to be again that that battle on stage to you know who hates Trump more or or now will just kind of ushering this this thought and entertain this for a moment\nOkay\nIt is Hillary or maybe it is Joe just anyone that can beat Trump except there has to be more than that there really has to be more than that because what you're looking at at the end of the day or on election day\nIs uh what's going on with the economy and and what are they really promising and and do I hate Trump I Know a lot of people have Trump but I didn't vote for the guy I may not ever vote for the guy but\nAm I motivated to go out and vote for this person what are they going to do for me you're talking about other sports were just talking about rank and file voters rank and file voters right because what did you see Wall Street journal going through Harlem and the and the day after the election and twenty sixteen why do you think he was\nJust you know random participants on the street interviews and the the one common thread in those and those respond is from most respondents was he was talking about problems we have here at home\nShe kept talking about problems over seas somewhere\nRespond as from those respondents was he was talking about problems we have here at home she kept talking about problems over seas somewhere\nOutside of this country was ... the reason the Trump one was not because he had all the solutions but because he simply identified what the problem was\nWhat the problems ... and the fact is you haven't had presidential candidates that have looked at the topics that people have cared about\nAnd even point out these are the problems that we have to solve them that's how bad it had gotten by twenty six team as we said the Democrats were talking about and still are climate change and race are two major problem ... well they're not\nWritten Americans didn't view it that way right from is president because\nHe identified what the problems were and now we can debate all day long whether all of the solutions that he has come up with\nOr that he has promoted or the correct way to go or not mhm but the fact is he came up with the problems and identify the problems and politics are so bad in America today\nWhere you just identified the problem in twenty sixteen that got you elected president of the United states right\n\nAnd then what you have now is two years later you've got a ton of people looking at the same and you know something a lot of the solutions are the correct solution some\nI mean that's in in that's it it because what you have to deliver in order to be reelected for a second term as results so if we're still looking at low unemployment we're still looking at you know the people taking more money home because taxes\nAre lower if we're still looking at a situation where the economy is getting better\nThan where\nDo you go you can offer free stuff what's that going to look like ultimately you're going to have to spell out how it's going to work\nUltimately you're gonna have to you know I mean\nWe say what you will about Herman Cain's nine nine nine plan but guess what people still say the the name of the plan now we toured a part in it didn't work and ultimately didn't work for him but the point is is that you come out with something very simple here's how my plan is going to work\nHere's what I Want to do while you're up against potentially a president in twenty twenty who has delivered some pretty stellar results on the economy\nSo you're going to do what promised a lot of free stuff do people still buy the hype\nIn the free stuff if they believe that will never be delivered ultimately\nAnd because\nHere's what changed after the break session and we saw this it was well the banks got the bail out so I should get mine even people that otherwise might be conservative you know we're like okay we want we do want more free stuff we got a ton of those calls and and so there is\nThat in fact there but the concern is too is that\nAmongst the you know just the generic voter population out their rank and file voter\nThey're looking at as a this big promise oh free health care for everybody free whatever it's going to be the big free package and they say to themselves you know what it will be free for somebody else and it won't be free from me\nThey they compare themselves to their neighbor or somebody else and it's like now I just got to end this good economy I just got to making this amount of money and guess what they're promising something to somebody else I'm not going to get any of that\nYour calls and comments coming up eight six six Ninety Retta\nWinds over ... ...

N. A. how Washington comes to talking [noise]\nInternet radio he is currently I'm Gary macaroni get to more of your calls and comments coming up following the bottom of the hour up but I I thought it's\nImportant to bring that up because that's more the the emotion of what drives an election but I don't think I I don't think we should discount how important that is in the ... election that reason the Trump is drawing the crowds that he is is drawing\nA especially from a Republican Party to you'd think two years afterwards that he's going in and doing these rallies and he is drawing these people and we had mentioned the the uh the the story that came out over the weekend that Tibet O'Rourke a small little theater\nHe couldn't fill that we're in the state of Texas just a couple of weeks out is was reported over the weekend that the real rock star even though we hate that term for politicians to begin with\nBut the real rock star still is Trump and why because there is an emotional attachment to him that is based on the substance of what\nBut the real rock star still is Trump and why because there was an emotional attachment to him that is based on the substance of what he's doing\nAnd that's what it is but that's what it comes down to it also how the left is behaving in reaction to have to be and that type of ... that that poses if you think of the what happened during the capital confirmation process\nYou know so that's that's what it comes down to watch the greater motivator on each side and will seat and a couple of weeks for video road logging here's your forecast\nTexas set to receive more rain today there's a couple of systems that will be providing moisture to the region in the Gulf of Mexico there's a low pressure systems and in the Pacific\nThere's a lot of pressure area both of those systems funneling moisture right into southern Texas and the four corners region\nAnd if you get up into the higher reaches of the southern the Arabs and southern Rockies you could pick up some snow fall as a result of that pre sit at the end of last week the winter weather forecaster on the climate Prediction Center was issued\nLikely not no but it was kind of a\nYou know with all due respect and well the answer I think we all know that any critical thinkers does\nI don't expect a Lindsey Graham or or another conservative on the committee or or Republican on the committed to get up and do what Kamala Harris did you know after the committee vote get up and storm out\nThat wasn't the point\nYou know but oh wait wait a minute and again you can't make the case he was trying to make the case that it was the same and I'm like no it was unprecedented what happened right [laughter] and you you can look at Justice Thomas you know that goes back you know twenty five\nOr ... that goes back twenty five years ago and and uh you know he those hearings were held and then but then but then he was he was you know confirmed that I Believe some Democrats even cross the line and voted for him yes they did I Believe that yes they did well I Believe it was a Democrat said at the time\nYeah ah so yeah so you know they they ... but this was unprecedented nothing was nothing we've ever seen\nA ... in our lifetime or in modern times\nHas has been like this so to even question that to me uh shows ignorance and that doesn't mean stupidity it means\nA lack of knowledge ah on on\nHistory and that's why we brought up he said that didn't happen was sort of my er and that didn't happen with Kagan there were people that disagree with that because we we believe that sort of my or and Kagan many times not all the time\nOn the with\nThe cell tower right to cell tower\nCase of the cell tower that they agreed with ... they you know that ah they used the in their writings they used\n'em a prior judgment or by opinion written by ... majority opinion written by Scalia is ... exactly that was the press and the right they use\nBut in many of their many of their answers and many of their their decisions we believe they legislate which is not their role which is why we were against their nomination but it was based on ... what they would do not\nBy what we want each in everyday mhm mhm ... what the job of the judges and that's the difference and that's something that we brought up with the whole Kavanaugh hearings that we said look ... you know conservatism Republicans stop have to stop arguing\nThe same premise that Democrats are arguing right Republican keep arguing most conservative versus liberal justice no it's not ...\nI'm not voting for a conservative judge I'm voting for a construction is an originalist I'm voting for a judge irrespective of what they wish the government to beat each and every day understand that their role is not to make law either left or right\nThere their job under the constitution is to interpret what the law says\nYou know it's interesting too is that as we got to the uh the the closer to the the\nUltimate vote on on a Kavanaugh you know I made the point that even the liberal justices respect the process in my opinion based on experience and I think one thing you can look at\nOne judgment you can look at from SCOTUS\nWas recess appointments which was ... yeah against all by against Obama yeah because if you look at that that really was something that was very clear on what the process yes\nAnd so respecting not only the process of how you know the confirmation process of of of how that's done but also again the process at the highest court I Do believe\nAnd you know you can say what you will about the opinions written by a Ginsburg or or whether they're descending or majority opinion you can we can tear it apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that\nBut in terms of the process I think\nThey're descending or majority opinion you can we can turtles apart and say well they're wrong about this or the wrong about that or we disagree with this or that but in terms of the process I think ah by and large\nI've seen them display consistently respect for the actual process and I can point to that one example but there are others\nA recess appointments was ... that unanimous decision where luck you can't do that and and and that is that is the difference when the left no longer respects the process when you don't respect to process what is left\nBecause what is left is shouting people out of restaurants do away with the Senate do away with this do away with the president they do away with the arts college do

posted\n... supporters are lining up for blocks one day\nSalmon or ah as late Sunday evening posted ... supporters are lining up for blocks one day before or the big Trump cruise rally in Houston so they were lining up a as early as Sunday\nYesterday that in what is it likely of voters or the Republicans are moving closer ... hookah that came out just yesterday I think I have writers somewhere yeah\nThe the the story here but it's so much tougher to tell 'em those house seats I just I I Wonder that if we're going to gain in the in the in the Senate mhm and so that's you know that's looking at populations across the state and right here or that\nYou know I just wonder how they extrapolated out to so many of these races where if they're using the public polls out there there are so few of them\nSo few and far between Saudi for those ... if you're going to the internal polling polling which I'm sure is being done by the campaigns you would have the better\nYou know a better guess at that right\nYeah it it gets here it is a a a Dems midterm advantage narrows among registered voters yeah my new national poll a few weeks before the midterm election shows the chances of a blue wave are far from a slam dunk for the Democrats NBC Wall Street Journal poll released a Sunday shows forty eight percent of registered voters\nWould prefer having Democrats in control of Congress compared to forty one percent supporting the G O P the seven point gap is narrowing from a ... point gap that Democrats had in September I don't know if that tells you anything though\nWell and and again I mean registered voters ... we've got to talk of likely voters and then again what the motivation is on election day this we've been talking about this it has changed since the Kavanaugh's confirmation\nLeading up to and since I don't know to what extent I Can't tell you it's motivated the left or the right more we do know there's no doubt the right is motivated Republicans are motivated right now are they more motivated than Democrats I Can't tell you that\nNow I I watch it on the Mike call before we started talking about you know the the whole Russian collusion at the top of the hour and I say that because my was not driven to call based on what we had said and\nTherefore he became passionate about giving his point of view across my called with that passion about the Russian collusion investigation and his anger and\nHis feeling that this could possibly changed the election you know and and move it to the Republicans before we started talking about I think that's important because I don't find many people like Mike mhm I don't think honestly\nNow we covered everything when it comes to the whole Russian collusion from day one and we've asked every question known to man kind of we do things that we have looked at it more\nOr as investigators in partisans and we believe that hey that with everything going on and with the Pfizer warranted and and everything there that we are going to find out\nThat probably the Democrats were up to a lot more hijackings than the Republicans ever dreamed of actually doing it as we know already\nThe only evidence some clothing with the Russians in any way directly or indirectly would be the DNC and the Hillary campaign to\nGiving them money to uh Perkins gave it to a fusion GPS and gave it to the former spy Christopher Steele who said he got his information his salacious unbearable fight information\nOr I or against Donald Trump from people close to the Kremlin ... so the only people that colluded any way with the Russians were the Democrats from the information that we have\nAt this particular point but I don't think right now that's driving anybody to go to the polls\nNo it really isn't um\nIt it could it is it an underlying factor as a part of the larger I guess scenario with Republicans or conservatives are based on following you know the work of of many really great reporters who who really brought to light so many things in this thing if you really followed it but\nIt could be there again is that underlying motivator\nThat's I don't think that's the big push right now I don't think that's the big emotion nothing right now um I Do think there's something to the the the fact that they've been alleging all of this sense you know a after the election and since certainly he's become president\nUh and they never showed anything for it and and it's really been this media circus and it's really based on nothing I think that's a motivator but it's not what I don't think it's the here and now I don't I don't see it I look I I think\nAre some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian coast\nLook I think that there are some people that have looked over the last couple of years and what the Democrats have done and they have included a ... in its in its contacts the whole Russian collusion thing and how unfair they believe it is and maybe that's apparently what's driving them to the polls but the difference that we've seen over the last month\nIn the energy level or what are they called the excitement level of Republican voters to come out\nWhich would make the difference in keeping the house and increasing the number in the Senate none of that has to do with Russian collusion right right or the mall or investigation at all or not\nI see I don't know what a of a ... report does\nThe if the ... if the report from last week is true that says the that Mueller would would uh issue the core of his report after the midterm right after the mid term\nI I don't know what that does politically because first of all how can it be an actor report without including the fact that of how all this information was obtained and what you just spelled out not us that direct line that we know\nThat no one has disputed between the DNC and the Hillary campaign and ultimately Christopher Steele\nYou can't you can't debate you and you can't put that out a report I don't think they do it's it's incomplete and what I Know the report right now it's not going to even talk about that and and that's that's the whole point it's like a ... but it's not even going to talk about the possibility of Trump looting with the Russians\nI I just because where where it would be the evidence if there's not going to be in the movement on indictment if it is just to report\nA chrysalis over at CNN\nA former Washington Post Iraq that you know where he said you know I think it's ... it's ultimately going to be just a just a report he's been saying that for a while it's it's ultimately just going to be a reporter is really not going to be any more indictments unless maybe there's a you know lying to investigators charge somewhere else along the lines\nAnd and we've got what are the Michael Flynn hearing and everything else\nOf us probably will never see those ... right\nBecause in and that'll be a complete does that it'll just happening right it's it's not the ... done the last two\nYears yet accusations gone just as good as the owner except for the fact\nThat you have the I. G. working on some information of what was going on at the department of justice during that time based on what the president and the White House sent to Mr Horwitz\nAnd we've been asking this way I still haven't seen anybody else asked what ... what we asked why would the White House sent it to the inspector general\nBut we're talking about the bad as the ...\nThat is the most interesting mystery that exist right now in Washington DC and nobody is talking about is asking the question is taught by the way on vacation I owed everywhere nobody is talking about talking about and we said it when it happened we said wise you send it into the I G the only reason you're sort of the ideas because\nYou suspect corruption why are there no leaks on this is nothing coming out on the story at All right\nWhen ... and people have just a refresher when rubber when President Trump said he's going to declassify or the ... the application and other emails that were sent between the FBI and the department of justice was to Twenty one different pages right ah and then it came out well he\nUh uh we have some allies that don't want us to ah you know release it there it might be some sensitive information so we're going to send it to the inspector general\nTo look at it and expedite whatever that are being poured yeah expedite a report out of and we said well why would you give it to the I. G. I. G. is nothing to do with whether you should release it oh\nCorruption and how how to our allies know what would be and how our allies know what's in it and what's not in it how could they object either way because they don't so why you sent into the ID so one reason you're sending the I. G. is that you believe you because you\nDeclassified have spotted a criminal event and you know that as\nThey was the role of the I G and because of the power that they have\nThe gene can go in and get the documents that even oversight committees haven't been able to get\nWithin the department of justice and the White House wouldn't be able to get it I mean that would be a political move right and there's also takes it out of the political realm you give it to the I G you give it to Horwitz and see what Horwitz can find in Horwitz has access to every corner note and cranny\nAnd the de OJ and and since that happened what almost three weeks\nMcGregor maybe you and I said what are we missing here is that what what are we missing alcohol but he also talking about this are we missing something completely in it right [laughter] eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nI have six\nAre we missing something completely in it right at eight six six Ninety read I\nHave six X. rated [noise]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "city": "Washington", "day": "22"}
