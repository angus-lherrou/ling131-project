filling in for a ...\nAnd uh you got some great calls up there and let's go to Jake in Quantico, Virginia yeah you're on with mark\nHijack say mark hey how ya doing real well how you do for a\nGood point I just wanted to make is that you mentioned about all the good that a hundred and she was doing with I'm moving the embassy to Jerusalem are recognizing conservative values of a nation of laws with one of the build the wall and all that despite of his personal shortcomings\nThink are a lot of times we can see with the uh the recent\nInterview that he did when he was asked a lot of those hard questions along with the first lady\nThat we can overlook a lot of these things despite his personal shortcomings of infidelity and such like that he still is fighting for these conservative values appointing these Supreme Court justice is like you were a noting about a course touching a cabin oh\nWhat is something that uh you would think would be something that would be condemnation let's say a and twenty twenty the next election if something came out you know fighting against someone like Hillary Clinton in the last election with a you know her\nHer personal server and breaking that sort of a\nSecurity law in that regard being part of the deep state having someone was something that you see you might come up to be the next battle that he's going to fight in a in the upcoming election\nWell I'll tell you what's going to be the next battle and off you heard last night we may very well I Hope we don't have the people were cheering me up last night and I tend to be an optimist that we might lose the house 'cause every race stands on its own and I know some reasons here in California that I never thought what happened like thing or are backer I mention his name and I know him\nAnd he's in trouble because they're spending millions of dollars so if the Democrats take back the house Jake you're going to see hearing you're going to see subpoenas you want to see the attempt to impeach President Trump and Kevin off and make these next two years worse than the hearings for judge Kavanaugh that's the biggest fear I have\nAnd we got to be very careful great call thanks so much Jake\nAnd now we go to your national forecast for cobra electronics\nSeen in the past couple of nights some freezing rain in the area of a western Oklahoma northern Texas north eastern New Mexico and south eastern Colorado\nBut that will likely not be the case today because the moisture source providing that freezing rain has moved off to the east and warmer weather for South Texas will see heavy showers today\nOysters source providing that freezing rain has moved off to the east and warmer weather for South Texas will see heavy showers today those looks down through the architecture region down into New Orleans areas hard hit by hurricane Michael\nThat could be further from the truth the truth the matter is that and I wonder why people like Hillary Clinton and and that all the so called a\n... bad actors that they refer to know why they haven't been handed out subpoenas and why haven't they go to the judicial process the justice system\nAnd I have to wonder that\nWell the way I talk about later probably well I'm very disappointed and Jeff Sessions he showed no guts no no uh for for us what am I thinking of you know he's been so we can in his position\nHe I was for him when he was named them but I've been very disappointed in him and by the way just to your point about Hillary civility that even the very I was thinking about this when you were talking the secret service they treated horribly who who who give their life up for them or she is and what what you did the\nAnd the other hand and you take a look at Joe Biden you know swimming naked in the pool and and and so on and so forth the papal they they're beyond the word despicable or a show where he puts it uh we ... a you know it it it it's you have to be\nTotally blind\nOr just totally ignorant of the fact that you I mean just look at the facts and look up the scarp respond in eight years we had we had a leader previous so our presidents so called president take this country down and I believe you set the racial relations and in our country back fifty years\nI I don't know the number of years or ... but I agree with you totally I mean saying if I had a son the Trayvon Martin whenever he looked like me are always assuming that you know that and what was the guy's name in the other state I can you know hands up don't shoot all of a sudden that there has to be believed\nYeah Michael Michael and he he sent it back and a lot of people who voted for him because he was like hey we're going to show we're not race and so on and yet he he update you're right it's worse now the animosity and this country's is worse than he was president\nAnd you know the the most disgusting part of the Michael Brown incident in ... was a simple fact that if you look back and look at the history of as as the events happened as everything went down\nHe walked into as I recall to convene a convenience store he pushed the owner around the store or the attending the store knocked it down to down walked out with a budget goodies and then went on down the middle of the street looking for trouble the guy was wired for sound so\nMinority it only ... yeah yeah I Know there are minority leader says that said\nIt was the way the police officers simply look you are right on all counts or member Obama what was it I don't know how many days before the election said we're going to fundamentally change this country have a I have a friend on radio sense measure of you sent your wife when we get married I'm going to fundamentally change you\nI mean it's it's it's insane and this was the guy we ... and the president and at\nThe end of the day as far as the person is so that\nIt didn't take very long for them to ... to ... to respond and I'm I'm Talking about ... odd Eric Holder and Jesse Jackson and\nAl Charlotte and it didn't take um what was it a matter of a day or two and they ran to Ferguson ... to ... to ... to stir up the eight and discontent as usual and you know what the amazing part of it was as they grow that Michael rounded gone end of the the officers patrol car to retrieve the officers gun just showed him\nNo matter\nSo so exactly but but so where so where are we as a country now the racial racial division in this country is incredible and it needs to stop\nBut they kept talking and driving home all this crap as nothing more than a dance smokescreen to make us look at the next issue that pops up and whether we like it or not the mainstream lame stream media is running this country and\nPete I Want to have their ... said it triggered a point that I think is very good on your side the left just goes from crisis to crisis to crisis right and most of it is nothing writes the the collusion with the Russians have what what do we wait two years on this stuff\nOr you name it and it's a crisis right now I don't want to get into the global warming now right now although uh it became climate change always from Craig in crisis in the world is falling apart but you as you said you've got a president now who's not letting him get away with is in fact my love what he said the minority community\nHe said what do you have to think about what's been going on in the last twenty thirty forty years\nAnd you know mark ... another thing I knew he was going to win that election and I'm going to tell you why and I hope\nPeople listening or will agree with all the time maybe maybe I'm wrong I've been known to be wrong we all we're all human\nThat election and I'm going to tell you why and I hope people listening will agree\nWith us maybe maybe I have long\nBeen known to be wrong we all we're all human but the thing about it was a he ... his debate ... including Hillary smoked every one of them smoke them off the stage basically\nWell and there was this guy has\nOh basic political affiliations he had never dealt in politics at all\nWell thanks Pete I appreciate your call very much yeah that's what I said in my opening monologue kind of the people\nThe respect the fact that finally you got somebody who didn't care about how he came across just said what are your thoughts over the top sometimes you know I Wish he didn't say some things on you know write songs on Twitter that he does\nAnd I wish he would I say that I Wish you wouldn't respond to a lot of people but he ... this guy you know you get the whole package\nAnd as part of the whole package I think he's done a great job I just listen to it gave a partial list\nAnd far better than George W. Bush and in certain ways they compete to one of my heroes Ronald Reagan because he he's done so much he doesn't get the credit for a lot of stuff he's done and as I said\nI don't care what he says I care what he does\nYou know ... I'm just thinking about a on a personal basis what kind of surge in do you want someone who does a great job for you or someone I you know has a great disposition ideally you want both the guy's been terrific in office and\nI think he's grown into an even better than I expected um and here's someone else who agrees but I go to disagree to Marcus in broad run Virginia you're on with mark\nOh yeah [noise] yeah I'm here thank you more and um [noise] I agree with your last caller and President Trump did not need this mess\nHe did not needed at all he was already a billionaire he wasn't going to lead is he could have sat out there and and not worried about anything\nShe worried about the people of this country and to go back in this country was going okay we're going down a socialist path\nThey were going down we are going down so long\nPath and he pulled us out he grabbed Josh pulled us out\nAnd do left is going crazy and he is right when he goes to the uh [noise]\nYou know campaign saying he is talking is absolute truth look I grew up in a democratic [noise]\nHousehold humming lifelong Democrats [laughter]\nOnly time my mother which was where she voted for Nixon back in the ... because of the anarchy that's going on and now we've got an arc here again [noise] ...

President Trump is pretty funny says you're going to get tired of winning so I mean who would say that yeah he goes over the top uh as we said you know there's a Twitter his tweets I should say\nBought two would ever say some right he's a character\nBut he's growing into the job and I think he's doing a great job I Can't wait for\nHim to be re elected a new although I shouldn't say that can you imagine their reaction I'm Talking about the less than the resistance cars and they're trying to get rid of them are right now that's why the young man who called me at the beginning they are saying well they expect is going to be the worst part the next two years I'll tell you what the worst part is if you guys don't go out there and vote\nAnd the Democrats win the house the Kavanaugh hearings are going to be\nIn fact I was going to be the worst part the next two years I'll tell you what the worst part is if you guys don't go out there and vote\nAnd the Democrats win the house the Kavanaugh hearings are going to be nothing compared to what they do the next two years that's my biggest fear and that's when we got to work on and let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven three three three not mark actually filling in on red eye radio\nAs a voice easier on the years in mind reads the stories to you will listen up for starters the print edition preferred by Ninety percent of vote your drivers is now available for free as an F.

I was going to measure we didn't get that yet you know Stormy Daniels a loss and he's he's a lawyer and he brought out though sweating ... and that's her name\nAnd she thought of or did she accused him of a you know they were part of this gang rape or at least that they were there and it was so officers they actually hurt the case\nThen the other ... case for its case against a judge Kavanaugh because it you start to get ridiculous accusations so\nUh that's how it ended in ... for those have been hearing a the answer is you you can't in this country you're innocent until proven guilty and you there was no cooperating evidence against the judge\nAnd that that's the way he does sometimes you you know you don't have a perfect society but it did start out with her saying I Can't understand how you guys like President Trump and they're trying to narrow down to find out what she didn't like about him and it looked like she did believe that there was Russian collusion but there's been no evidence of that and I'm going to predict now\nThey're trying to narrow down and find out what she didn't like about him and it looked like she did believe that they was Russian collusion but there's

then she you know she mentioned the thing I Wish I had her on to you know but I think I'm expressing it pretty well\nThat of all the people around him that we're a guilty and something to a collision but they weren't they had nothing to do the collusion\nOr whether it's Michael Flynn horror Manafort there was other stuff and so those cases are really agree just because\nDid you ever hear I don't I don't want to pick on her I don't want to pay on her right now but you don't pick on her I think the whole thing no I'm not up here uh well I'm not I'm not afraid to\nPick on our but the point I was
