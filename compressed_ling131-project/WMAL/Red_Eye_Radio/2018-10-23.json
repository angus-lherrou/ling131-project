from the mid west but into the deep south\n[noise] ah so GOP affiliated voters have surpassed democratic affiliated ones and early voting in Arizona Florida Georgia Indiana Montana Tennessee and Texas only in Nevada have democratic affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voter so far in early voting\nAccording to the data key Senate races are underway in seven of those eight states\nAnd we'll prove pivotal and determining which party controls the or the chamber the latest data suggest robust enthusiasm among early Republican voters that can put a dent in democratic co spray blue wave in next month's midterm election remember I'm breathing verbatim from the NBC story\nA Republican or Republicans typically dominate a early voting by absentee ballots\nWhile Democrats tend to have the advantage with him in person early voting for example the entire early voting picture and Florida which has yet to be gone in person voting is incomplete ah in Arizona were two members of the house democratic uh Christian\nSouth cinema and Republican Martha mix Sally ... our neck in neck and the contest to fill the retiring Republican Jeff lakes\nA Senate seat forty four percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared to thirty three percent wedding democratic affiliation right twenty three percent of early voters were not affiliated with either major party and the ... group as other\nIn the NBC News or a partisan analytics in Florida where democratic Bill Nelson who's running for reelection in a tight race against Republican governor Rick Scott\nForty four percent of the early voters had a Republican affiliation versus thirty eight percent of the Democratic affiliation and Eighteen percent who are not affiliated with either party in Indiana or a democratic Senator Joe Donnelly is facing reelection challenge from\nMike Braun fifty one percent of early voters had a Republican affiliation compared with thirty nine percent who had a democratic affiliation and ten percent were not affiliated with either party you know that's something to be looking at not just the\nNot just the voter enthusiasm of Republicans and Democrats which by the way is extremely important mhm because if you have more enthusiasm of Republicans in her mid term election like that that's almost unheard\nOf well especially when you talk about first day of early voting ... one reason they took to take a look at that as it because people were essentially tropic of the bed to to vote to to get there say\nAnd who was at which group is that that is more motivated to get their first that can tell you something about\nThe the point I was trying to bring is not not the Democrat or Republican but\nIf you have if you know if ten percent or in the one case was it uh\nIn Florida eight Eighteen percent not affiliated or independents going right now where the polls on were independence live right now our independence being affected by what has gone out now independence for the most part did not like what was going on in the cabinet hearings\nWhich may be a huge uh you know a driver to the poll of independence but we're independence going in this election\nI haven't seen a lot of you know election polling analytics on independence\nWe've heard a lot about the enthusiasm Republicans and Democrats but of course that's key because independence and most elections decide you know where the country's going mhm\nAnd I just haven't seen much I don't doubt I'll do some research on it now yeah I'm going to do more research see what's out there on on independence but it just popped into my head right now we spend so much time talking about were Democrats are Republicans are\nAre not realizing that a significant portion the the determining factor of votes in most states is still you know ... where the independence lie mhm\n[noise] yeah you you get to the break down to the polls that we do have available to us and that number of I guess I'm not independence but undecided voters starts to become much much smaller and that's where that's why we're you know for me I'm anxious to look at some some of the latest polls because\nYou go back to uh the Montana race or any of the other Senate races and if you've got numbers that are that are pre Kavanaugh there that's\nTo uh the Montana race or any of the other Senate races and if you've got numbers that are that are pre Kavanaugh that that's something very different though I mean it's it's something that because people will make this this inevitably happens the closer you get the more the the fewer undecided you have\nAn any given race and it's crucial just I think\nThat it's the job of the pollsters to to show those numbers as close to an election days you can but you know again ah they haven't been as active as they were in years past and you and I've been following it you know for a while maybe that's going to change in the in you know later this week\nWhat we know for example that the internal polling that was being done roughly two to three weeks out of back in in twenty sixteen\nThe Hillary people knew they were in trouble in the internal polling you didn't hear a lot of talk about that at all\nIn in the general public but after the election post election that's just started hearing that they saw the you know that that's when they started seen in some of those districts in those states you know when we're talking about Pennsylvania\nAnd and and Michigan in Wisconsin that's where they saw some of the change at that point mhm and they said oh and you know they saw that swing at that point and in most elections as we see\nWhat you see in July is not necessarily what you see the last three weeks right now internally because they're doing the polling consistently\nYou have the political parties that have an idea they see where the momentum is going at this particular point because we are just two weeks out now so for the last week\nEspecially if you went inside most political parties and say we're what is your polling showing you're going to have one or another say okay the momentum is moving our way or isn't moving our way mhm we just don't have access to those particular polls at the moment\nYou know what we know afterwards yeah because he the adult the analyze you know what happened in a you know particular you know political election you know we'll we'll be analyzed after the election but it's what's happening right now in the internal polls are probably showing that\nBut when we look at so many of the polls out there so that that haven't been taken in two three four weeks\nSome even more than four weeks out what was going on in September is not the mindset of the voter of a significant portion of the voter right now right that\nI mean ... it's it's I think um it it will be interesting to see what the rest of the early voting in a turnout is like and and where those numbers comeback but but ultimately you have to get\nDown to those polls in each of those individual races and I just suspect we're not going to see you know a a [noise]\nI guess an onslaught of those polls leading up to that a leading up to election day or two weeks from today by the way\nSo um but the early voting on Texas and Florida\nA you know will be interesting I think to watch but then you go to those tighter races I'm In Texas it's its own work\nAnd and cruise cruise the latest polls has been ahead by at least in the latest two balls\nOr by seven points or so and they are CPS average he's up by seven and he said over fifty percent and and each of those last two polls so you know that's not one that I Would call at this moment two weeks out assuming those numbers are still in that goes back a little over a week ago\nAssuming those numbers still hold that's not one that I Would call a you know neck and neck or or up in the air and undecided right now I'm you know too close to call if you will I think it's right now that momentum is with Ted Cruz\nOr and if you look at it if if the last poll for the uh but I don't have it here in front of me last poll for ... or a rock and Cruz was a week ago\nThat yeah it was a little over a week ago I guess my point would be that doesn't even include the last debate\nDoes yeah yeah that's and and that's my point is that is what I was I was asking you at the top of the hour or the or the pre show meeting I said you know because\nI Would I Would think that you would have won and maybe maybe we'll see one or later today or or Wednesday that covers the debate maybe they were waiting and and going through Monday to to have people digest that debate and\nUm you know I don't know I really don't know but I I expect we'll see some more polls but they probably won't be as numerous\nAs what we've

don't attempt and don't get into anybody else's territory\nOn the Buffalo Bills has been cold and the old colonial is why is that because the bills don't attempt and don't get into anybody else's territory\nThey are never able to identify room anybody else's territory that's very true on the field so you'd be if you can't look at the Buffalo Bills going with their own territory yet look during the colonial is yeah in fact do the opposite they're anti Neal colonialist because when they're on often say keep being pushed back\nBackwards they're not gaining any territory there are being pushed further back this\nIn fact I was looking at the other day they have the worst a very close to Arizona but they have the worst attempt at colonizing\nThe victims were\nNow they have become the oppressor they're just as bad as Trump they're just as bad as any top ... because they have decided that they will negotiate to try to make things better\nAnd the radical left doesn't want to negotiate show they want the constant and they want this constant the debate out there they want to be able to cry\nRacism day in and day out and the fact that it's never going to be solved because it can't be solved once it solved or once you get to where most people believe society is today where racism is not a factor like it was\nFifty years ago or sixty years ago or a hundred years ago or a hundred and fifty years ago\nThey have to win says that it's actually worse than it's ever been or they lose their purpose or purpose has gone they can't say that things are getting better and so boom it's going to blow up\nAnd a significant portion of the NFL of blacks in the NFL that were initially supportive of it and said OK enough we made the protests we've made our point we've got the money from the NFL to put to good causes we believe are good causes\nNow they aren't the defenders of the victims now they are the oppressors is what happens\nIs what's happening with the Democrats everyday it's happening now in the NFL\nWe've been saying it for years here not unexpected no because it doesn't matter who you are the person standing with you nearly with you as the case may be in protest could be the oppressor tomorrow I mean that's what's happening\nNow Malcolm Jenkins is a sellout right I'm sure you know ... whatever other labels and want to throw at them but a Neal colonialists that's the that's my favorite one he's now Neal colonialist yes that term was used on an NFL football field [laughter] well that's a first at least\nWhether they're making progress right [laughter]

officially returned illegally identifying individuals as biological males or females and of course have gone nuts and the Babylon be which is like the onion a parity website\nParody news website ... of the greatest\nHad this could actually be a real headline in the leftist made it really could anti science Trump Administration to revert to definition of gender to an objective scientific standard\nThe anti science anti facts Trump Administration is considering reverting the definition of gender to a biological objective and scientific standard drawing the anger of the pro science left\n[laughter]\nThe party of science [noise]\n[noise] they even have their own sign your guy but\nI just I just I we I was gonna bring Mr Ed district just didn't have time and I was just thinking what we were talking about you know how\nYeah I just\nI just like we I was going to be destroyed district just didn't have time and I was just thinking what we were talking about\nYou know how the expanding victim and oppressor base of All right the Democratic party right now we're ... we're using the example ... of the transgender movement against feminist mhm were feminist now and we've set feminism is dead if any man can be a woman whenever they wish to be a woman sure I mean\nIf you look at the end in fact the uh the civil rights act is is gone if anyone anyone simply by claiming simply by claiming can belong to any protected group there are no protected groups\n\nAnd the matter what their goal is are are they stealing or ah right they still in for money right\nA buddy through colonial because it was it was it was coupled [laughter] [laughter] it's real bad [laughter] but the but the thing is is that um\nThe the\nIt was it was part of the whole well there's too much money in politics\nOr oh who was the guy that was on um I used to be on CNBC then he went over to MSNBC or Dylan Ratigan\nYou know that was his ... and he you know have had the fake anger thing going on but we said look break this down off work to do it you know what I'll break it down to two words\nCasio Cortez\nShe spent next to nothing compared to her opponent\nHillary want Hillary didn't win right\nBut I Know but nobody in the ... really has complained about money in politics right sit right Hillary so it was funny 'cause I saw that on social media somebody said Trump won because all the money in and said a\nHillary raise more money and then they just shut up they were quiet life right a look at look at a a look Democrats don't complain about money in politics them if they're raising the money you see that in the exact ... nobody's complaining about not I've\nNot heard one Democrat come out and say it's just wrong in that Robert Francis O'Rourke is raising unprecedented money\nPursue it right now in fact it's quite the opposite they're they're promoting the idea you have sons I mean it's a good thing\nSo when that started coming out and that was McCain's ah but you know that was McCain fined gold and and that's when the rules and regulations came out as two groups of people that couldn't that couldn't run advertising or you know within most at sixty days of a of an election I Believe ... six is within an election\nBecause it might influence an election right well that's the only reason you're running ads if to influence an election and the reason you run ads close to an election is to influence an election and at that point we just said do these people understand\nHow the country was formed do they understand about the petition of government for redress some grievances irrespective of who that group is do they actually understand that and clearly they didn't want to understand it so we said this spat going back ten Fifteen when you when I started working together\nSo going back Thirteen an hour or maybe almost Thirteen and a half years ago right when you got together and I know we were saying that beforehand ... but it's like we said we don't believe in the first amendment you don't live in the second amendment and so that's grown and grown and grown and grown and grown and since that time we have said look if you don't believe\nIn these major attendance of the constitution of the United states you actually don't believe in the United states right and now we're to the point here but they don't believe in the Senate they don't believe in the the well the who wants to come out said that the presidency was adequate and that was a few weeks ago was that that was that Michael Moore\nWasn't Michael Moore so it was somebody in that same thought it was the same time well no it was at the same time when he said it's over that the ... century essentially the the office of the president of the United states you know it's over this is you know it's it's now gone it's\nAnd then someone in that same period said we we need to do away with the presidency\nAltogether right and so but we've heard the electoral college just to go now it's the Senate that has to go right that's being picked up by more on the left every single day if you go to social media oh it's just not fair of a sudden it needs to go\nA Senate needs to go to and as we've said that is extremely important because if you do understand the constitution which unfortunately\nThe majority of America does not\nHave you seen the polls a majority of Americans can't tell you what the three branches of government are they can't tell you what the rights are in the first amendment to the constitution they don't know they a lot of them don't care\nBut the majority of Americans don't know recording to the polls and when it comes to the ... you know the separation of powers the three branches of government that's the vast mutts\nMajority of Americans don't know are going to the polls and when it comes to the ... you know the separation of powers the three branches of government that's the vast majority of Americans can't tell you that well then you don't even know how our country works\nWhich I then we abstain and we understand why people say the country isn't exceptional you don't even know what makes us exceptional right or if you believe that the Senate shouldn't be gone a few believe that the electro college should be gone you don't understand the basis of what this how this country was formed\nBut it wasn't that that it wasn't on a pure democracy it was on a representative government we're the minority would be protected were individual rights would be protected something that the left used to understand and promote\nAnd now they don't care as long as it's as long as they they don't care to protect the minority as long as it's the minority but they don't care about [noise]\nUh they don't care about individual rights as long as it's individual rights of people they don't care about right and ... but when you get down to it it's a clear under an I'm not understanding of how the country was form so\nWe have said that that's a huge issue for many conservatives because they do understand the constitution and they understand everything that we just talked about right now and that has energized them to go out and vote switched beyond just because\nThe Democrats were against a nominee that Trump picked because Kavanaugh went way beyond Trump that's why you had the conservatives or never Trump hers ... most of them [laughter] not all most of them uh uh come aboard at that time and that's why we've seen I I Believe in more United\nA Republican or Republican Party so you can look at that you can look at some of that may be driven by the fact that look we're concerned about the house because the whole Russia investigation goes away if we lose the house and uh also when it comes to judges the fact that if they win the Senate\nOr ... and Trump has another chance to get another judge in maybe in the next couple of years and that would be unprecedented because conservatives understand but if you can have a construction is court\nAnd you can have of not only a five to four but six to three ... that that can move the country in the right direction for the next generation and that's extremely important the other thing is and this is new and it's the caravan\nSure and it's it's interesting too is that uh you you mentioned it earlier but it bears repeating here they even if the caravan and likely won't reach the border before an election day two weeks from today that the news cycle is what's keeping that story there and and\nWe've talked often about how the news cycle you know changes so not drastically but so often\nUm and they because the protests by the left is one thing even even during the Kavanaugh a confirmation process itself\nWhat was the first protest all those documents remember we need to be able to agree we need time round view that that was their first protest was that it became about Dr for what we said\nAfter he's confirmed whatever happens and you know we didn't make a prediction but if he's confirmed on a Saturday through the vote this was before the confirmation vote then on Monday and they'll move on to something else as they did\nBecause it but there is there is at the point being there's a new protest and new hot button a\nAlmost daily but certainly a couple of new ones every week so we got two weeks left so you've got the care of and that's that right now is new but that goes back\n... if you I guess this adds onto a consistent issue that's been around for a long time but the Republicans thanks to this current president when he was campaigning for president\nOwn and\nIf you think about it you know everybody talking about the conspiracy theory and who's paying for it and who's not paying for it\nIs working for the right it is a motivator for people on the right to get out and protect because if he needs money for the wall he needs to house the president if he's going to get money for the wall he's going to need the house\n... and and so to me this has been a huge motivating factor and\nI saw the other day that after ah the the illegal immigrant caravan them which is to get into the United states from Honduras that they walked about nine hours my whole at that and and blisters and they were going to rest for a while well at this pace they won't get to the United states for a month\n... so uh you know if that was the pace that they are are are going that has to you know who was supporting them you've got you know a right wing website stating far right wing website stating that it's you know ... groups of Wall Street journal\nStayed in you know basically they're not sure they talk about the leftist politician in Honduras that organized system started it\nThen they were surprised how quickly or the number of people got aboard they talk about people without frontiers the U.S Mexico a group that has been got involved in it who directly is giving the money nobody is really sure here at this particular moment yeah a lot of these\nThat is Mexico a group as and got involved in it who directly is giving the money nobody is really short here at this\nParticular moment yeah a lot of these groups are have funding in the past\nFrom folks on the left including cirrhosis but whether they have directly given the money or not who knows right but the fact is if they are right now it's working against them will have some audio coming up here just a little bit actually from the view right right which was a really good from a from Meghan McCain talking about it all coming up plus your calls

Republicans out there so when we and we're going to go over to get a look at some of the early voting out there that NBC reported yesterday would shows Republicans\nAre in most states are that they have the surveyed and seven of those eight states with a close Senate races favoring the Republicans right now one of the reasons why you know one the one issue is that Democrats are using that they believe is in their favor ... what's the one issue Democrats are using right now against Republicans\nAnd it's the one that we said they would we said you've got to either do nothing or do something but if it or or complete the task because if you don't do it and you do it half posterior the Democrats will use it against you when premiums skyrocket\nCome down temper and October ... as they now refer to what Trump care mhm\nThat's the one thing that they believe that's the one thing in the polls that the Republicans are way behind that the people believe that the Democrats will do a better job they do not ... the Republicans on healthcare yeah and we said would happen\nYou saw Schumer was a it was a a few weeks ago uh\nWell it was actually it was right after the Kavanaugh confirmations where they talked about their their focus was going to be health care 'cause obviously there are internal we're showing you know this is where we get a win on an issue but what's their answer to health care\nWhich Medicare for everyone Medicare ... right\nWell we can't for Medicare for some\nBy the by the way it's complete Medicare where everything is taken care of ... which we can't even do for the senior citizen who put in for Medicare for their entire lives and it still doesn't cover everything right and they're promoting the fact that we can a Medicare covering everything for everybody twenty four seven for the rest of their line that's a\nReally now mhm we can't even do it for senior citizens who put in poured their entire working lives we how do I know what are the commercials\nThat Medicare part B only covers this you have to pay for this and therefore you need to get supplemental that's right or cross your fingers\nYeah I didn't care part B only covers this you have to pay for that and therefore you need to get supplemental that's right\nOr cross your fingers\nOr cross your fingers which means they can't even they can't even bait we can't raise for Medicare for some as we've been saying there's no way to big\nOr Medicare for all oh we we really don't know do we can [noise]\nWe can we can go into um I don't know how many trillions of dollars\nOf debt hundreds of trillions of dollars the ... the only thing right now I think the Democrats could have focused on it if they didn't go crazy over capital if that hadn't happened they might have been able to use that as a wet ... that's a good point take the Senate for video road law here is your forecast\nA pool of cold air from Canada has decided on the central us mainly the northern plains and the central plains as we get into the day today will only see a high in Indianapolis for instance of fifty six\nWhere I just mind ... now you may spend a lot of money at your doctor\nAh you know and I understand people not wanting to have well I don't want the chemicals or or this to to go to sleep but that's something I Would discuss with my doctor even sell you know okay let's not do the pills or whatever let's what can I Do what do you recommend\nA I I don't know that I Would go into that for me I Would want medical experience first if I'm going to turn to somebody you know\n[noise] you know for for me it's really interesting and and I've been blessed that I've really never had major sleep problems at all and and I feel blessed because of it but I Know as as I was telling me ... or are we just today the last week I still can't get on a regular schedule where you sleep you know really one time of day who the day shift to so tough\nNow I'm back on this ship sleeping twice a day 'cause that's what I did when I came on the ship and I remember I just said I'm going to you know I couldn't\nI was trying to figure out okay what time cut I sleep all I Can't do that with my body my body tells you when it's time to sleep yeah and and I'm Glad that I can pick up on what my body tells me that because it's twice a day I go home and I go to sleep and and and then I sleep again at about five to six o'clock when my body gets tired\nAnd you know I mean you know what a disciplinarian I Am at that people that know me and to me my whole life said you really became disciplined I mean you have to sleep during those times and I said if I don't it throws up my tier mind my mind is gone if I don't\nIf I don't do it but because I'm a because I'm On that schedule or early do I ever\nHave to you know take even anything over the counter mhm anymore I I was for a little while they're taking the melatonin maybe once in awhile and\nSometimes on weekends I may have to take a little bit of it because my I changed my my sleep pattern but that's even rare now I've decided no just sleep and if you wake up in the middle and I get up you know do some stuff for an hour and I go back to sleep and it was my ... my my dentist my uh who\nUh is asleep therapist who who uh\nSaid when I told him I scheduled because he was always concern as my dentist 'cause there was also went to sleep therapy\nAnd I told him I scheduled me what oh she's asleep twice a day goes ... that's how the basically the caveman used to do it came I used to go to sleep like seven o'clock there was no TV they went to sleep seven eight o'clock\nThey woke up and midnight one o'clock and set up for a couple of hours him back to sleep again that's how human beings used to do it he said so you're basically into it and he said do you find many problems and I haven't had any problems no type of medical problems but to me the only thing that really insurers\nAre that I I mean it it's almost said I Do have to I Do have to work out almost every day working out does make a difference for me [laughter] tiring out my body does make a difference doing physical activity\n[noise] I don't have any trouble getting to sleep I have trouble finding the time I mean my my wife is so busy it literally is a a round the clock you know huge family or other business aside from you know this ah and and then of course a lot of the stuff pertaining to to this\n... is that I've known your long enough you can operate without sleep I Can't yeah yeah well I Do not my my\nPoint I was up to a um a Sunday Morning and uh up until\nA almost one PM on Monday a afternoon that's when I went to bed Monday afternoon\nI got up at six thirty and then went back to bed for another Ninety minutes ah\nSee I I Can't I Can't I've known your long enough to know that you can operate with sleep your brain still works my brain does not work yeah the same at all if I if if I don't sleep crack heads is so tough for me to to to do that so I guess\nIt's slow and for the August ... same thing I mean my allergy well yeah and and for me it's the same thing it is also too about the exercise and\nSo I guess it's slow and for the August ... same thing I mean my allergy well yeah and and for me it's the same thing it is also too about the exercise and diet and everything else because I had I during that time I mean\nYou know where the where the big family wedding on Sunday and I was I mean I was there until I was the last one house at night falls closing up a venue and and uh and and clearing everything out are loading up\nA but\nHad I had a well a piece of wedding cake [laughter] that that show [laughter] and you know what I mean because you and and you have to know that I mean everybody was looking at me strangely although I did\nI take some home and I had some Monday morning you know when I when when it was time and I knew that wouldn't be that wouldn't cause me any any problems but you you have to do that and it also has to include like for me to the difference with people I Know people that can like drink coffee you know full strength coffee and have no issues\nUm it's you know comedians and cars getting coffee\nIt's amazing to see Jerry Seinfeld loves coughing\nAnd he talks about it and he's they drink you know it looks like he's drinking at least two or three cups if I had two or three cups of coffee and today well then that would be no but I just couldn't I couldn't do that I can drink a total of maybe one and I'm good but\nThe I have to know the the point being is I have to know that I've got to keep exercising I die it's got to be right especially during those times when I'm not going to get that sleep I'm going to have to really mind my piece in Houston and lots of water or\nThe insomnia thing I've I've been there um and and maybe it's because I'm aging I it's not about insomnia for me it's about schedule a typically lately it has not been this this past weekend was a total anomaly but\nTypically it has been here lately you know getting to bed a and getting a good seven hours of sleep on the average um and I I Do notice the difference if it does it is you are a especially physically you're you're better\nYou or mentally your your better I mean this has been a big issue for\nTruck drivers for a long time because there's hours of service that regulate the drivers and and a lot of changes to those hours of service going back to well gosh going back about Fifteen Years and and I'm Glad that I couldn't do it why couldn't do it it's a airline pilots and you know they all go through they ... they all have their their hours of service\nYou know based on operating you know the the aircraft are operating the big rig\nAnd I for me I don't know how someone could sleep in a you know in the cab of a truck for me I ... and I I think I guess eventually I'd get used to it but\nBecause you've got to ... you got to create that sleep environment right a or a people tell me though the same thing I don't know how you sleep during the day I don't know how you sleep all night\nUm or or stay up all night and sleep during the day but for twenty two years now I've been I've been doing that and it's\nIt's perfectly normal I I don't see how people work on the rotating shifts my my dog ran my best friend's father was a cop yeah yeah most of his career yeah he would work six weeks for shit yes than six weeks second ... life than six weeks third shift\nSaid that I don't know ... I don't know I don't know how we did that you can't get a routine down now you got to have your routine and that's the whole thing you've got to have your routine\nOr whatever that is uh that worked for you whatever works to get that sleep you've got to stick to that and that has to be disciplined and you know it's a ...\nYou know I I don't know if they still do that is in law enforcement down to me ... that are well that would be an an alertness concerned yeah are you alert when you're out there well I knew and you've got to change sleep just like yeah I Would be a ... total concerned\nYeah I have a friend who's been a prison guard for a long long time and that's that's kind of what they do they it's called that's called shift work right where you're changing you know that that your routine\nAll the time my dad did that he he was talking to me about it recently he said I I still don't know how you do this and I said well that it's easier than what you described a back in your military days he would do that when he was a military police officer in the air force they would do shift work especially in\nThe early days or when he rose and rank that you know changed he didn't have to do that but uh you know for the longest time they did the same thing and uh as an MP and he said that was just for me he said that was just difficult it was impossible because you don't have a routine\nOnly thing I Can't do is on Sundays when I go back to my regular sleep shift yeah I get up at like\nFive in the morning yeah I have to change it a little bit I have to get up so I'm tired by the time Sunday night comes around and go to sleep [noise] one thing I Can't do on Sundays Evers lift weights\nI lift weight in the Sunday I can now my muscles are too much stimulation just ... yeah

about buying the votes\nYou want to give away something you promise something for free I mean back in the day Hugo Chavez in Venezuela if you if you uh don't remember Venezuela was a a a socialist

I I think it is I think ... every every\nPolitician on boats on on both sides looks at people's self interest now weigh it all depends what your self interested that's why I voted myself into a site I vote for my self interest me much might [laughter]\nWhat's what my it it really didn't work out for me this last one I assume we since we have to pay more under the Republican tax plan no but what is my what is my bigger self interest\nMy mind bigger self interest and your bigger self interest is not what other people's self interest is my self interest is not getting free stuff\nMy self interest is freedom well we have the liberty of ... and and the ... of of our nation right that that's my number that's my self interest is less so people vote for their self interest all the time for other people self interest is give me free stuff\nThat's not my first self interest because I Know that it's a bogus concept I Know that it doesn't work I Know that it doesn't solve the problems that they claim that they're trying to cure\nAnd so they're simply selling to people who believe and don't care what the future may bring look we live in a nation that doesn't care about the deficit or the debt either side now doesn't care about it it's completely and totally irresponsible\nBoth Republicans and Democrats don't care about the deficit don't care about the debt they don't care they don't care what it does to a future generation\nSo ... for both sides now\nKeeping the status quo of what we have\nToday is extremely important sure\nKeeping the status quo of what we get from the government I Can't tell you when the banks were getting bail out how many people called up and said there shouldn't be bailing out the banks who should be bailing out me right also government's role is to give you money while from somebody else\nAnd that's where this shift was from you know a lot of people in fact that that said that they were either conservator voted Republican and they were talking about saying it and it it it really was kind of this\nMentality that had been built through the media and also from Capitol Hill and at that time uh you know at the uh the the under the Bush presidency\nOr that the world was coming to an ad remember a McCain and Obama had to come off of the campaign trails to rush to the White House to save the world you know because the world is coming through that\nUh but the that that a\nA fear drove a lot of people after the bailout started happening\nTo say well listen you know that's going to happen then great I Want mine so it became is almost the looting effect right the government money looting bright idea of hey I wouldn't mind if they if they're thrown out money throw it to me and I'll throw it ain't right to throw it to me we were saying no throat which no one right way\nAnd and that's because when government gets involved in every aspect of your life they become a ... and everybody understands us when you take it out of the partisan talk and you're talking about should we be run by a monopoly right sure healthcare system be run by a monopoly\nDemocrats used to be scared to death of a monopoly why because they understand the monopoly has complete control right there for Ken Ken you know can do whatever they wish to do you know we live in a way we live in a a a a time\nAnd you know already got responds whenever we talk about health care well other countries spend less on health care no they don't know not for the same services they die\nAnd you know already got response whenever we talk about health care well other countries spend less on healthcare\n... no they don't know not for the same services they don't know\nThat's all that is that's that's that's the only thing in this equation because you think about it oh wait a minute a you know a a Ocasio Cortez is promising or Kamala Harris was promising me this on the living wage right okay that's that's his or Ocasio Cortez is saying ah will ah will will pay for college\nWhich would include your college you're existing college loan or in some cases right will pay off your college mom um\nThose are those can be retroactive or can be a future promise for people who are voting now not only if you're talking about the you know the people who might vote Democrat or or might be in the center are being independent and look at this idea and go well ... well that could work\nOh does it really effectively work with their particular situation and then on top of that or does that interest me if if I'm really think about a generation who was having fewer kids\nThere's the Booker plan even resonate with them\nFor kids I I Know what about me I'm not I don't I'm not worried about my children because I don't\nReally plan on having a family I'm giving my children the debt well yeah [laughter] I'm not going to have kids because it's too expensive even when you're fifty thousand dollar plan enough it's not enough so I'm not a oh wait a minute but\nThe thousand dollars doesn't help with breezy my child now that's what I mean you ... dollars a year exact and help with raising my child now that's\nBecause the idea is that we have you know we have too many kids in these poor families that by the time they're Eighteen they're a disadvantage because they can't afford college or home and all this all these items well no no no no no no you're you're not\nYou're not trying to get the future vote of those kids who haven't been born yet you're trying to get there but you know would be parents votes right now and they're thinking to themselves well no I've got a number of reasons why I don't want to have a family 'cause I Can't afford it you're not giving me so it's never going to be All right\nSo now I'm so Camilla Harris gets my vote because she's promised ... dollars if she gets a lot and have it out with my kid exact I Want to end the styles and now\nAnd or Bernie gives me or maybe come out with Harris comes adds onto it and says free
