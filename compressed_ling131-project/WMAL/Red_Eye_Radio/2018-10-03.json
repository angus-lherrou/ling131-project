are running on climate change I loved that one on Amazon to pay Fifteen bucks an hour that seemed to be a big story yesterday went to that what happened to the size of documents story and their Russian collusion\nBecause that story just has been buried since I don't remember that one what was that throughout well it it said that nobody has has covered it in and we did all I think about a week ago we we brought it up we said oh\nSo Trump decided not to release it but\nHe didn't go to the he didn't go to his the director of intelligence about the uh the information whether she'll be declassified he went to the inspector general we don't go to the inspector general pretty quiet the classify something you go to the inspector general give something because you proceed there might be corruption and what you have\n... for governor electronic Caesar forecast\nIt may not sound like much that an area could get six inches of rainfall and be under flash flood watches and warnings but that's what we have over the next couple of days\nIn effect for multiple states including California Arizona Nevada Utah Colorado and Idaho where even six to ten inches of rain is enough to dislodge Sandy soil Roxanne tree limbs and flood dry ...\nThe unverified dirt on Donald Trump and we know it was done with that on verified dirt so that's where the Christopher Steele you know whole thing comes a comes in a to this [noise] uh\nAnd ... and one of the key players there to using GPS a was married to still is married but at the time her husband was a high ranking a department of justice of racial Bruce\nBruce or and then we know what they used you know the the ... and ... and all that ... well so we wanted well wait a minute just doesn't make sense if you don't give it to the inspector general the inspector general only looks at corruption and\nA\nAnd by the way that's almost a replay of what happened I think maybe it was a ... a week ago Monday or Tuesday and we brought it up yeah because there were just other things and we just started going over it and we went\nWe don't understand why would you give it to the inspector general inspector general ... you know you get this information at San redacted you're looking at it and and and ah\nAll of a sudden oh the light bulb goes off it would be an internal matter which would be in a scenario like this if it is a fact that people at the Justice Department are under in the Obama administration\nOr more working\nTo get information and use that false information that dust yet\nOr to get a warrant knowingly using it to get a slice of war it then that would be corruption that would be abuse of power that would be a massive\nIt it leads to the the the claim a from Rudy Giuliani mhm\nThat ah the he believes they committed perjury right yes that that that they they they signed documents stating that this information is intelligence [laughter] when in reality it was simply you know of opposition research hands on and they knew that it wasn't intelligent\nAnd they vouched for its authenticity ... often to study our credibility ... and and you know again that's what Giuliani said we don't know but it only goes to the inspector general\nIf they believe people there because I where would you get that ... that was what happened is that it would start inside the Justice Department with American people reaching out to go in this case you know Christopher Steele or an impossible you know we don't know if there was anybody else involved we do know he was involved but\nBut if if you if you do the unwritten action and and they're saying well it's too sensitive well that would be again\nThe director of national intelligence your ah your attorney general in the head of the FBI or foreign powers\nAnd so you wouldn't be going in that particular direction and probably you will be discussing it especially with my palm pale secretary of state former CIA director and say okay you need to talk to the British are because we need to get this a release\nYou know what do they want to keep quiet and not that that may not be that that could be being done right now we don't know or could have been done already\nBut to say I'm giving it to the inspector general to look at it look at why\nInspector general only looks and corruption right\nThey look at corruption in the department he's looking for corruption in the department of justice that's what his job is his job is not to declassify is not just job is not to look at a a document say wow I don't think you should declassified and and that was the impression that you got when the story first came out\nIt's like oh wait a minute he's inspector general and undo that right\nOh mhm\nSo after they rejected it apparently someone in the administration looked at it and said this is corruption given to the inspector\nGeneral because that's because that's what you would look at it the ... the inspector general's basically uh their to investigate what happened in in the Justice Department I mean that's the whole purpose of that position to do that essentially that internal\nAh investigation he the the inspector general's office really as internal affairs a you know to a large degree so when\nAnd and it when they saw that its I could see General Kelly\nLooking at the president and saying Mr President if you come out\nPoint things out that's going to be purely political right so it only has you know there's we we have to build a political will to go after people if the inspector general\nComes out with an official report that's different not that the president and the end and uh the AG sessions couldn't go after people for this\nIt's that it would start in the political arena if you have this over\nTo the inspector general who was appointed by Obama this is the process by the way if if you look at a you know the things that Trump has done not talking about you know the things about ah the licensing for the NFL or or or licensing for the media the FCC licenses for the media or any\nOf that not not the words not what he said but what he has done he's been very respectful of the process and this would be the process you would want to go through to see the have the inspector general\nLook at it and say please take a look at this and and do your due diligence here\nTo see if this is exactly if if it's what we see and then you noticed the media you know you had some what websites covered I didn't even see Fox saying why the inspector general ... somebody may have done it I've not seen it and I haven't seen it on their website right but I haven't seen really\nAnything maybe ... or maybe a\nA you know National Review covered it the federalist I don't uh you know I Andrew McCarthy did I but I didn't see it right but it just the media when completely quiet on it but the other thing that I noticed was\nThat the new has like a couple of days after ... I don't know why they didn't release it I don't know understand why it went to the inspector general and all of a sudden everything's gone quiet on that front to yeah everything yeah U. of and heard from Jim Jordan you haven't heard from a Devon noon as a in over a week on it saying well look we need to get this stuff released why\nRight because if it goes to the inspector general they're looking at corruption\nAnd well what would the corruption be if it's about the Pfizer warrant and the text messages and everything in the upper management of the FBI and the department of justice there's only one thing that it could be because that's what they were ... acting and that would be corruption inside of the department of justice\nAnd the FBI and maybe some of the intelligence agencies and and what they did but specifically for the inspector general it would be at the department of justice and the FBI corruption that's what he would be looking at this\nSo yeah one so we put two and two together a little over a week ago\nOh and there's been nothing on this story and other media the media is gone quiet on the ... higher Russian collusion narrative\n\nThink about it I mean I Know right now the focus his cabinet but they're they're very capable of a walking in chewing gum\nAt the same fine but when it comes out going out at a drop in New York Times brought up is family tax yes exactly why not collusion Bowers that story\nBut that's a great point you made is you know he's going through the process and ... if you look at it and they ... somebody said look if you were at least is then they're just going to say you're cherry picking and you're interpreting and don't don't do what you're saying you're interpreting something here that really doesn't exist here you go to the inspector general nobody's going to debate the inspector general no\nNot even not even the ... the Democrats he was appointed by Obama right Michael Horowitz was ... so you go to him and he'd been and he does it which is the proper process to do with it that way you take the political aspect out of it right\nAnd especially right now if you look at okay all the claims that well this would be a disruptive of the of the more investigation\nAnd you know the president that actually you know acknowledge those claims but all of that is taken off the table when it's when horror which takes the investigation himself all of those claims go away\nBecause or which will you know even though you know the president won wanted this done a ... in an expedited manner or which will do his due diligence that's his job to go through this and determine\nIf there was any corruption [noise] do you want to get in we do have a line open eight six six Ninety ride I\nTalked with ... radio toll free

A. how Washington it's the talk\nRadio he is\nCurrently and I'm Mary McNamara eight six six Ninety ride I we go to Alan in Dallas texas Alan welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show\nGuys love your show up talking to you I just wanted to give something about recollection of memory about five years go man about six guys would go down to the coast\nOf Texas on a fishing trip [noise] to police officers twenty serve a nearby veterans thirty year veterans two guys that wasn't even a part of the group\nHad joined the group one guy were out on the boat talk and he remembered twenty seven years ago he put two and two together that I put him in jail for carrying a non law a weapon he could remember that he decided he needed to leave the group and come back home\nThe man but remember that because that was burning moment in his life and all I'm trying to say is this woman\nIf that had been such a defining moment in her life she she can remember that that was Kavanaugh wondering I'm ... percent on top of her she cannot tell us how she got to the party how she got home\n[noise] and\nKnow if it was such a defining moment in her life had beach\nHow did you get home where was this house\nThat would be things you would think a person would remember if it's such a defining moment and now all of a sudden it's just last may go post maybe she did maybe she didn't but this man has been nothing but exempt or his whole lab\nFor the presumption of innocence to be just thrown out the window by the Democrats it's just crazy to me\nYeah I mean that's part of the the weakness as we said nobody is just credible or non credible it so you have to take it you know based on the evidence that exist\nAnd their testimony and when the ... or whether the testimony that they give especially when it comes to these witnesses notice they were there ... and when those witnesses or act in the ass and say sorry we weren't there don't know about it a bad at all and even one of her friends\nAt that point your credibility starts falling apart and when do I don't know\nThe where the win or the how of everything surrounding it yet you are a hundred percent sure of the PR or at that at that point you have problems yes\nYou do have credibility problems in any case and not just this case in any case\nYou would have complete and total credibility problems which is what the prosecutor\nSaid yes and this is what it comes down to is is uh can you put a case together based on all the evidence and and it does again it's not a criminal case so it doesn't rise to those standards but it would be very different if there were a number of people let's say even two or three other people\nThat work at that party or had a\nFirst can some kind of first hand knowledge of that event and their stories mimic what she was saying\nYou know the thing is when you make an allegation you have to be willing to provide all the evidence that you have used to cooperate yep you're allegation to begin which which is a lie detector test right if you don't ... and nobody is above it I'm sure somebody has brought that up but\nThat has to be brought up because just like the fact that\nWhen you used and said these are the witnesses these people witness it and they say no and then you say I took a polygraph a test will have you ever helped anybody else take a polygraph test you know and and you know trying to beat is what they're trying to say no I never did well when you get a sworn witness dating no\nI Know she I I you know I Know she did well then you want all relevant notes\nBecause she is using the she is using the polygraph as cooperation that there is credibility tour accusation therefore she should be willing to give everything over to the Senate Judiciary committee so they can verify\nThat the lie detector test was done in a legit way\nRight and and and that's again part of the process because if you believe it was legit you're promoting it as legitimate\nThen you have no problem you were telling the truth right and the process that part of the process was done thoroughly thoughtfully\nAnd in order to get the results that it was always going to get because she was always telling the truth right\nHer attorneys on Tuesday implored the FBI to interview her and act\nOn investigative leaves a leans they have provided birds inquiry into sexual misconduct\nAllegations against Brett Kavanaugh quoted as inconceivable that the FBI would conduct a thorough investigation of Dr Ford's allegations without interviewing her\nJudge Kavanaugh or the witnesses we have identified in the letters to you attorneys are Deborah cats and Michael Brown which wrote to top FBI officials and our letter obtained by political\nUh again it's not an investigation about this is the whole point in and look I even said that the other day I said well now that they're doing this you know they'll probably talk to her at the end\nAnd also ... wait a minute when I saw the story yesterday said wait a minute no they won't they won't they if they don't I understand why they would not because it's not they're not investigating the crime they're doing a background check\nOn Kavanaugh and so what they're doing is they're not going after they're not from they may not be going to her or tapping on to get their statements because they have their statements by the way there is they don't get to know the\nThe the attorneys for attorneys don't get to know who the who the FBI interviews or who they don't\nIncluding people that they say they told the FBI they directed they say they directed the FBI to interview other people associated with is the FBI may be doing that but the FBI doesn't have to contact her lawyers and confirmed that they're doing that right that this is not about her\nThis is a background check on Capitol it's about her claim but she is not this is not about getting her any kind of justice she does\nThere is uh\nUh no there is no white for them to be a part of the process for them to be included or directing the process\nKnow they think that because they were able to manipulate Capitol Hill into giving them their day in front of the camera but that's not how it works with a background check process you may we may not ever know\nThe American people may not know cabinet or may not know who they talked to who they interviews\nAnd and political here I'm reading from keeps using investigation it's not an investigation it's a background check as a timeframe for completion of the inquiry draws near Ford's attorney sought a call later Tuesday with beer officials to discuss the investigation you don't get to do that and that's not an investigation it's a background check and it's not about her\nIt's not about Dr Ford it's not about about the claim but she does not there is no there is nothing they're going to deliver she's not going to get another day in court this this is not a criminal legal process she\nDoesn't get a copy of the background check I Know only the senators do that's right and uh as well while McConnell Bob and only centers will be able to look at the FBI's final\nUh findings ... minority leader Chuck Schumer pressed for the public release other redacted version of the report but Republicans are worried about breaking precedent by releasing such information they don't release information from a background\nCheck right er which will be made public available to the Senate the before the Senate votes this week on Kavanaugh's nomination\nAccording to GOP leaders all one hundred senators will have access to the report and it's secure studying for the FBI releases it as when he expects the report into multiple sexual misconduct claims against Kavanaugh to be completed he sings said I think it will be sooner than friday but I don't have\nA an exact date by the way we will find out what's in it because you'll have a Democrat Senator I'm almost positive release something or half\nWhore a partial part of the transcript that would be damning ... uh you know to a to a cabin off in the context of not the complete\nParagraph or sentence or whatever right uh and then it would force the Republicans to ah you know released a holding released the entire thing so I'm\n\nOverseas too [noise]\nYeah I think you're going to see likely are either because if the investigation as as the report came out late in the day on Tuesday but the investigation is winding down then\nBy the way down ... yes [laughter] thank you well none of us do we know but my point is like the the records investigations are technically I was correct but yes as as the reports came out and that's that's exactly how everyone is phrasing it yes\nAnd ... and it's a criminal investigation and it's not it's like round because that's what they wanted they wanted a criminal investigation\nThat was never going to happen it was never going to happen but keep in mind there they are they they were given a clear directives and scope on in terms of the timeline\nYou've got to get it done in seven days so of course if it's done let's say the the interviews are done with a report still has to be written so imagine that\nThe that that the interviews are are winding down now and and maybe only a few more to do on Wednesday then the paperwork has to be done to submit the report\nAnd that likely will take what I'm at least today and they don't wear and we went we we've been told that they can get it on the earliest today later on today yeah\nWell if you have multiple people talking about it there would be one person one leaves likely at the FBI\nThat we'd compile all of what the different ages found because it's not just one agent and it's not just in one town in fact that they're doing these interviews so it's it's all over the country depending on where those subjects of those interviews are\nBut the point being is that it it's likely one lead that's going to compile all those and it's likely a series of reports of the interviews and that's a pretty a it would probably just be transcripts of the interview\nAnd and then a summary on each interview and then the the lead\nWould be responsible for summarized in the entire report I guess I'm guessing if you want to get in lines are open now eight six six Ninety right I\nAgree with what I told ... he

L. more Washington comes to talk [noise]\nInternet radio heater hunting and I'm Gary McNamara let us go to Bob Brian and Marshall, Virginia Brian Hi you're on the radio as we talk about Kevin on the up behind a background check I don't want to say the word because it's not welcome you're on the air I bright\nSide they're doing good\nWell my wife or does it like politics so she doesn't need this stuff but she catches up a little bit she asked you hear me every now and then and um she ... she says\nHell can need Democrats get away with this and I'm like first of all these are Democrats that any more than why does our concern is okay but\nI said I'm a ... of ... now got gave her up lock your doors ... yet glass windows look at why you're trying to keep up the honest person I'm\nThe bigger picture here and Donald Trump\nWasn't my first check but but I'm so pleased with what he's been doing it keep it in these people like upset all he's playing chess game and he's twenty moves to head up but it is going to be\nA general is going to get his his nomination okay I I honestly believe that but\nMore importantly right now they're talking about the blue and red way no no surprise Trump that instead of yet there's a ... as the nominee is triggered by a a free up\nTell us that is a ship up\nOf subject ... or ... or whatever your ship is built on right now and there are people that have been sleep or is it like call them Christians that are ... that they don't look they're going to get up and and this nominee\nAnd and this nominee is going to be a way well thank\nYou Brian we uh we're short on time but thank you for radio road law gives you forecast\nIt may not sound like much that an area could get six inches of rainfall and be under flash flood watches and warnings but that's what we have over the next couple of days\nIn effect for multiple states including California Arizona Nevada Utah Colorado and Idaho where even six to ten inches of rain is enough to dislodge Sandy soil rocks tree limbs and flood dry creek pets\nFrom any previous Republican administration before this one as we talked about yesterday we talked about the trade deal to do the trade deal with Canada and Mexico and had the stipulation on the automobile companies like we had that would've been absolutely unacceptable\nAnd ... and and the debt and then what the projected deficit yes a is somewhere around a trillion or ... or more you know when we look at that are over the is it over the next year I think in the next fiscal year um that wouldn't have been acceptable in fact I remember\nWhen Obama came in to to power came into the presidency he was talking about well I inherited\nHuge deficit remember that mhm which by the way we had to point out well you were actually a part of it 'cause you voted for that seven hundred billion dollar package so you were part of that you didn't inherited you helped to make it happen it wouldn't have happened\nAh without the Democrats voting for it as well including him but the point being is that\nBack in two thousand this would have been you know early two thousand nine but two thousand nine they were talking about it even the Democrats were talking about it by the you know that now they were talking about it because they wanted to put that on\nOn George W. Bush\nAnd they wanted to you know they wanted him to own it completely because everything was Bush's fault remember\nBut river rock rhinos rentals started before that but then again rhinos became the swamp yes but rhinos in the swamp was\nWhen all we're really came to the fruition especially when McConnell in pain or they were saying we're tough enough and the budgets when you look at you know twenty twelve twenty Thirteen twenty fourteen the Republicans were furious and conservatives still had a solid hold of the Republican Party that's gone\nWhen that was it that ah that that that\nUh Paul Ryan proposed the balancing the budget and it would have taken until twenty\nThirty oh that that was a that would have been a freak out that well that right now it would have been the it was the the summer of the the whole camp it was the summer when\nYou know a of of ah twenty twelve okay it was the summer spring sort of only get so it was before this one and two of election right yeah All right so you have that scenario and he was called a radical\nYou know for wanting to balance the budget by twenty thirty right I mean that was oh no no no that's that's\nUnacceptable now we give the the president credit or do in fact I I think that falls on his shoulders the credit for getting the corporate tax rate down to Twenty one because you and I thought that was never going to happen right based on the rhinos on Capitol Hill and the fact that they couldn't get it\nDone right but but that tax cuts have never been the it's always been the spending rhino when the swamp had was always directed at the out of control spending in Washington not necessarily the belief in tax cuts and that was really I'm In my opinion drove the anger\nAnd created the rhino when the swamps the spending the spending the landing on the the campaigning on twenty sixteen\nFor ... no ... even earlier than that remember you know you and I sitting here late at night when ... came out and they were trying to shut down the government uh uh uh uh again in the shot down the shutdowns have never been about tax cuts the shutdowns have been about\nSpending and and when the Republicans wouldn't stand up to the Democrats you write every mild rhinos who recalled the swamp Trump was coming in to get rid of the swamp stop the spending to stop the\nSand and even go into that office or the or the school lunch program you know and the rhinos back then going oh no we can't cut anything ... and so when you're that goes back he's so much for\nWhen you got twenty Fifteen and you know and and uh a banner was leaving and Ryan was coming in the bank or didn't like messy so he went to work for a tobacco company right and so Ryan came in and and ... remember that but the thing was that everybody expected Ryan Republicans\n... maybe it was unfair but it was what they expected of Brian was to redo the budget deal and when he said nope what's been done has done he was automatically targeted oh yeah people were furious because ... they wanted him out of the speaker of these are the supporters of of the ... the the president back then\nFurious they wanted him out Trump's gotta Khamenei has got to clear the rhinos south to swap out we've got to cut spending liquor we are today so there's been a huge evolution of the Republican Party in in just a you know roughly a three year some ... well\nRemember leap go back to twenty twelve why was Paul Ryan brought onto the Romney ticket\nFor conservative street cred remember yeah the concern with Romney was that he was too much of a moderate\nMuch of a moderate who was our final question to a ... a a Andrew Breitbart\nYou know why should if if he's the nominee 'cause it was it was still early but it but if Romney's the nominee and it it looked at that point potentially he was going to you know that I think it it was pretty obvious by that point\nBut he was going to become the nominee but if he is why why should you back on him and his answer basically was ... because ... which wide awake rings so true right now does today as you thank you Andrew Breitbart for those words\nBut I think it's important but yeah it's I mean look at history in and see what Ryan when swamp was about it wasn't about tax cuts was\nEverything ... being a rhino and Vina but now it's changed mhm but back three years ago yeah Swat Valley state now but yeah a swamp as deep state a swamp is what's going on right down the Senate Judiciary committee what the Democrats yeah it's sort of been moved over ... nobody's viewing McConnell right now\nAs part of the swamp well I don't think nobody I use a Republican leadership right as part of the swap if they had done if they had spent and and agreed to a budget that they did this year and last\nYear [laughter] three years ago\nThese are Trump supporters would have been absolutely up at arm's these guys gotta go not a peep right that shows you the evolution it's look I'm not making a judgment here this is just an observation of where the Republican Party has gone you know or\nYou know were against the spending but this is not about opinion I'm not criticizing this is just the analysis of what those terms meant back three years ago\nAnd the fact that the definition has about completely inside the Republican Party inside the Republican mindset and this is a Republican voter\nI don't necessarily blame those in Congress and even the president\nYou know when they talked about you were going to cut we're going to ... we're going to cut as to where they are today because that's simply reflecting where the Republican Party where the rank and file voter has\nGas if there were pressure if there were pressure right now\nOn spending on Obamacare and all of it it would have been done all that would have been done it would have been a priority\nAnd the president is not wrong for folks focusing on national security and and border control but it's part of the again where's the mindset of the voter that's the question well mindset of the vote or is that now we don't really want all of Obamacare to go away\nWe just want the penalty to go way\nHey we said look look look at the polling from five years ago\nA until they were discussing it last year and you could see the I mean you could see the difference overwhelming yeah\nThey were against Obamacare and then when it came to getting rid of Obamacare was the\nWe need to get rid of the taxes and the mandates and let the benefits we like yes well as long as as long as you're there you're never going to control spending ... ever and you're not going to control debt and that's where the mindset of the country is right now how you respond as a politician to that\nTo do the right thing and be fiscally responsible I don't think it's possible right now no\nBecause there was no ... there's no ... there is a small core as butter we identify a senator and a half [laughter] yeah right that might be concerned about it and maybe twenty to

similar to the state level systems that led police on local authorities send out amber alerts and weather warnings the biggest differences scale\nBut nationwide system is designed to blast a message to all two hundred and twenty five million smartphones in the United states reaching about Seventy five percent of the population news of the presidential alert test drew almost immediate criticism\nOn social media what some people vowing to turn off their phones believing wrongly that they will be a captive audience of president Donald Trump [laughter]\nSome\nWere worried that the system would allow him to tweet every American mhm or check every American\nIt's a tweet here in the story there or the federal emergency management agency ... and experts say the presidential alert will not be Trump's personal megaphone [laughter]\nYeah but I\nBet they are given a ... a lot but they argue they are arguing oh they're screaming yeah it's a necessary twenty first century update to the emergency alert system that has for decades allow the president authorized broadcast and every television and radio in the country\nAnd an event of a national emergency [laughter] so it to Eighteen or this afternoon ... will send out the first message testing\nThe new nationwide presidential level wireless emergency alert it will go to every smartphone\nIn America that has turned on and

followed by an emergency alert system message broadcast on every TV and radio\nAt two twenty pm eastern time\nIt will feature a voice that says this is a test of the emergency the national emergency

well why would I pay someone to you know do this part of it when I could do that automated it would be more efficient it would be laughter as the people can do other job as as we said\nWith the you know the ... on the uh uh the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada mhm ah by the president coming in and and and stayed in\nA that there has to be more American or shouldn't be more North American materials are in these in all the vehicles and all the three countries and setting labor standards and some wages in Mexico what you're doing is you're going to be tried you know below or\nUh the the the the lower worker and expect to see a ton more automation coming to Mexico and the United states lowers your workers will be again right I Love lower overlooked lower skilled workers in the United states and Mexico will be overlooked and they're going to be looking to do whatever they possibly can because\nFewer cars will be sold because the price of cars because of the new trade deal will be going up in the United states Mexico and Canada and that that's not the only worry the other worry 'cause remember what the president said one of the president's ... main goal we talked about this yesterday\nWhich to have companies in the United states producing it here and selling it elsewhere\nWell by doing what he did you're going to get the opposite but there's going to be less of a chance of America being able to sell make cars here and sell them elsewhere because of all the rules and regulations we put on cars in all of North America and Canada and I have to say North America and then say\nCanada Mexico and and the United states because they have\nChanged North America to that in the actual name of it and and so you know we disgusted uh yesterday I ... the wall Street Journal and others you don't have that discussion saying look you're actually going to hurt\nCar production in the United states you're going to hurt lower skilled jobs especially in Mexico or there's something going to say fine you're gone automation you know automation a that comes in Tempe comes into this particular point and in the United states to and you're still not going to be able to\nDefeat all the cost of the regulation from government\nIn the new trade deal which means what there's less of a chance we can build automobiles here and sell them overseas which is exactly what the president wanted and now he's implemented a program that does exactly the opposite of what he claimed he wanted to begin with ... that's the frustrating part in\nIt and keep in mind in two thousand eight when the domestic auto makers were bleeding cash\nTheir their foreign arms their foreign business was what was keeping them alive\nYou you've you've now encouraged the foreign arms to say okay we're going to make them all over here mhm\nAnd that was one of the president's number one complaints and so we implement something that will have the opposite effect based on economics which is how people respond

didn't pass out she fell asleep\nRight she didn't blackout right\nFrom drinking too much when she fell asleep so that's mhm so did he go back to you know that that's what I'm Wondering whether he's

look\nJust very simple you drink beer you fell asleep I Do it all the time I drink wine I fall asleep\nDrink beer you fell asleep I Do it all the time I drink wine of fall asleep\nYou don't blackout you fall asleep\nThat I Would say that if you say forty percent said there was no bias\nFor all but two thirds of Americans believe\nAnd I would say that if you say forty eight percent said there was no bias or in the rural and fifty two percent said there is by is the fact that you have sixty six percent of American voters favor an investigation that means many that believe biased didn't play a role believe it should be investigated anyway\nYou're talking about again the independence there those are independence and her saying okay a notch or maybe I don't think so but yeah I think an investigation should be done right\nSo that sixty five percent of American voters favor or that investigation where we are right now\nThe FBI report could be released only to the Senate it will not be made public unless it sleep a [laughter] yeah excuse me it won't be made public until it leaks\nAnd then liberals will be screaming for transparency\nThe first time they've screamed transparency ah regarding the FBI and all I don't know roughly I'm just taking a gas the last couple of years or so\n[noise]\nAh ... you know it's interesting that seems like a after two years Americans are paying attention to probably do the Russian investigation to sixty five percent of Americans mold\nA a you know believe that the investigation or you know into the FBI and department of justice\nOr to see how the investigation started a is a is warranted hey maybe there's a couple of Democrats and they're like we said they believed that Trump committed collusion and they want to find out and everyone and wanting to release ... to ... to ... that he committed maybe there's a couple\nOf people in there that actually believe that well I mean if you look at the number I mean that would go\nAh you know beyond that a typical party line number of just say well he you know of the people in the center being roughly wanting a the independence and then Republicans being the other forty so that goes to sixty five which means there's likely a cup a few Democrats are liberals mixed in that\nAnd who knows why they want to but yeah maybe they think\nThat it's going to show that he's guilty but we've been we've been saying this it doesn't matter who's guilty of what what was done was done so somebody needs to be brought to justice there needs to be justice in this case but there can't be without transparency\nAnd by the way we pointed out again today because we haven't been able to uh we talked about earlier because we received an email we talked about it we believe it was early last week\nAnd and this is the because we've been getting some questions say what happened to the whole Pfizer warrant application and and and those Twenty one pages we're getting we're getting feedback from our listeners saying hey just disappeared person is going to declassify to disappear and what happened nobody's talking about the story\nRight well we did a a early last week when we said 'cause we were sitting here on the air and the Kavanaugh thing was big at that point and we finally are guy just started talking about it casually\nOn the air and saying I mean what the world why would you send it to the inspector general\nYou know to get it because what what what they're saying is okay ah there there may be some sensitive things are in here we have some of our allies uh we're going to release it ah but ah we're\nA if we have so much action for our allies and we're going to send it the inspector general to go through this thing uh uh uh to go through the saying an expedited way and we went inspector general when he was elected general has nothing to do\nWith whether you're release something because it's sensitive top secret material that would be your director of national intelligence but that might be you might get advice from Mike Pompeo because it's a former CIA director and talking about OK what our ally subject to which we heard was\nWas a Great Britain and and information on Christopher Steele that they didn't want released but we still sort of thinking to ourselves\nWait a minute why would it go to the inspector general his factor general ... we don't understand this doesn't make any sense he only investigates corruption oh [noise]\nYeah so in the un redacted version they have found information that they wish to give to the inspector general of the United states whose ... of ... the inspector general of the department of justice and\nWhose job is to find corruption and the abuses in the department of justice\nBecause you look at that on an aerial imagined that the okay so the president's reviewing that certainly uh you have Kelly in the room with him and then the advising as chief of staff where do you go with this I could see General Kelly look invest and and the president clearly looking at this going okay\nThis is this massive abuse\nSo I could see General Kelly looking at us and and the president clearly looking at this going okay if this is this massive abuse of power under the a ... in the Obama administration if that is the case if we if we're seeing what we we think we see here\nThan this actually will require Horwitz the inspector general to be involved I mean that's going to happen anyway right yes lot\nYou take the politics out of it because you let the I. G. do all the investigation on it\nTell us what happened here\nBecause the I ... going to have access to records\nKeep in mind what it was like for Republicans on oversight committees and really the White House the White House has been calling you know the echoing a the the uh the the ... and and the death of a new noses of the world\nAnd calling for the release of those documents by the FBI well guess what the I. G. doesn't have to call for that they are gee has access to it directly yet so the I G takes this\nAnd the president because the president comes out and says hey we we recognize abuse here we see this based on this uh on redacted material now from the Justice Department will that instantly becomes political especially with this president\nWhile the president has that authority to come out and announced that clearly and has the authority to classify that that's not the issue\nYou take the politics part of it away and you also expedite the process of not just looking at these documents\nBut the I.
