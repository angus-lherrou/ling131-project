Congress said that so the interpretation by many legal experts in probably by many judges\nIs that since birthright citizenship was going on at the time and Congress says yes we agree with this and it's in the immigration naturalization law we agree with the way the fourteenth amendment is written and it's been interpreted the wrong way still it shows Congress approves of it and the courts may come out and say\nFederal courts would probably come out and say\nBecause they would cherry pick them ... and it would be you know uh and and they would come out and said nope sorry you can't get involved in it\nAnd in all likelihood\nBecause of that Nineteen fifty two congressional ruling there is a great chance that the Supreme Court would just say\n... as the Supreme Court has done before we're not going to get to the interpretation of it like it took over a ... close to two hundred and ... was a wrote a two hundred and Thirty years before they ever said that the second amendment was\nIndividual right two hundred and Thirty years but the Supreme Court to finally get to that point if you get don't get to the exact right case and write it in the exact same with the right way\nSo Congress has so many so the Supreme Court is forced to look at it\nThey may just come back and say nope you don't have jurisdiction their end of story and so you never actually get to whether the you know get to deciding what the original intent was like they did in the Heller mhm for the for the second amendment mhm and that's the problem\nSo in all likelihood we won't see it changed in my lifetime because of that great I Wish we would because the original intent had nothing to do with illegal immigrants and and that and and children of illegal immigrants in this country that I ever did right eight six six Ninety ...

Lyman ... keep figure in its strapping an adoption stated that quote\nSubject to the jurisdiction of the United states meant not only know legions to anybody else send up quote ... and senator Jacob Howard who introduced the language of the claws\nOn the floor of the Senate contended that it should be interpreted in the same way as a requirement of the Eighteen sixties six civil rights act which afforded citizenship to all persons born in the United states and not subject to any foreign power\nOr the Supreme Court has never decided otherwise now the problem is though as a ... let\nMe see I've got the ... right here in the Eighteen Ninety eight ruling that that is being brought up by many people on the left in Ninety eight rolling in the wrong Kim arc case the Supreme Court held the children of non citizens when born on us territory are us citizens by birth however\nThe parents in question in the long case were illegal immigrants meaning that the court did act they may have had it in their opinion but they did not address\nActually the status of children born to parents in the U.S illegally they made that claim but that was not a a\nCase where they actually made you know a decision on it it was an opinion in a case but not directly involved in that case right that makes it at that point being is that the parents were here legally right the parents were here and even though they said it did cover it\nAs he writes here he goes what the Supreme Court has held this without Quebec Johnny spent\nThe Supreme Court has never held otherwise some advocates for illegal immigrants point\nTo the Eighteen da da da da da da de la ... art but that case merely held that a child born on us soil the parents\nWho are lawful permanent legally dominance out residents was a citizen even though they said in it they expanded it out that wasn't part of the law so they actually did not create legal precedent to that point right\nNow the only other problem that the the the president would have with that and and by the way I'm I'm from the ... and I I Know you are to a ... I'm from of course when you understood why they pass the fourteenth amendment to begin with\nYou know after reconstruction and you don't have to live a writes activated to sixty silver right right where you knew what that everybody knew it had to do with former slaves yes that that's what that's\nWhat it was all about because the parents of those children being born the children being born slaves\nThe the parents in that case were not subject to any foreign jurisdiction now that the problem is because uh I\nAs I said I don't believe will see it in our in my lifetime I I'd be you know that's really a dump statement because who knows how long I'm going to live but if I Lived Thirty years or more All right let's throw out a figure\nWho is Thirty years [noise] um you know I I I still don't think we'll we'll we'll see it because I think one of the road blocks is look the president's right I agree with the president on this\nUh but the problem is the Congress in Nineteen fifty two added to the immigration and naturalization act they added a portion that basically\nAgreed with the way that the fourteenth amendment was written they said we agree with this this is the what immigration should be this is now they didn't they didn't specify and they didn't say\nA children of illegal immigrants become citizens all they said was we agree with that\nAnd so the courts probably will look at that saying well since at that time they didn't say we disagree with how it's been interpreted and we disagree and the law should change and you know when it comes to illegal immigrants because they didn't make the change\nThat many judges in the federal system including the Supreme Court might just say well that's up to them too they they interpreted that way or we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent there was an opinion\nThat's up to them too they they interpret it that way or we go back to Eighteen Ninety eight and even though the the courts it's not technically legal precedent to wasn't opinion are based there that the court might just refuse to hear\n[noise] right [noise]\nAnd send it back down to and it may never get to the point of talk of defining what jurisdiction mean eventual eat we will get a bench Lee someday we will get to it but it took two hundred and over two hundred and Thirty years to get to the ... was it to hell or two thousand eight\nOf two thousand eight\nThousand five two thousand I forgot about it's roughly two hundred and Thirty years it if it it took ... to finally have the Supreme Court interpret the second amendment yeah that it was an individual right\nSo\nAh two thousand they\nWell time flies so that\nThat's the problem and that you you have you have to word it the exact same way I just don't don't see it but those are the legal challenges that you face right now that the Eighteen Ninety eight opinion that's now law\nWhich uh again this is where the fourteenth amendment was not written specifically to address it as a true construction as you would look at it and say doesn't say it applies to non citizens\nAnd in order to apply in order and and you would need to that's how I Would do to say construction is doesn't say it if you want to say it differently than say it differently\nBut it but it doesn't include it\nBut will it ever get to that point where they even\nThe Supreme Court actually hears and the whole goal is to define what subject to the jurisdiction of the fourteenth amendment actually means will we ever get to that legal place is my question and again I just I don't see it in the next\nThirty years I'll Try that out for example\nBut it's a way to start the ball rolling\n[noise] ... yeah I mean I I think ah it certainly brings up the the debate and we if if the president is you know going to take action near through executive order then you're going to see it and the courts the question is will the high court take a case like this and\nAnd so when you look at the question yesterday where I struggled when I heard it I said well it's really the wrong question [laughter] it's kind of president do this with executive order will of course he can if nobody challenges can\nDo it effectively as the question and and right now he's not going to be able to do anything effectively ... the only thing is is that it was a political reaction to\nThe the care of in\nA two ... illegal immigration in general um and and the president's not wrong or whether he's doing it now or any other time\nAnd the approach maybe that's the point maybe the whole point is let's see if we can if if that's the cause they know full well it's going to be challenged and so at that point you you decide when you know you're going to announce this now\nUnderstand to the ah the political leverage that that is is created quite possibly a by just the announcement of between you know now and and uh well six days for the midterm but beyond that it is also something\nThat I think in the current political climate that has to be discussed because ultimately what does it do\nNow it it it brings up the discussion but I think it gives us closer to and hopefully somebody on the right will position that Democrats to finally say that they're for open borders mhm\nSo that's you know that's part of the I guess that's the political side of the effect of it the legal side of it will be interesting but it won't be quick this isn't going to happen\n[noise] ah\nIt the the executive order will come out and it will be immediate an injunction immediately will be ... immediate block from the courts right\nAnd then they will go into the courts and it will sit there for however long it takes to go and I don't go to see if it ever get right\nAnd this is something that I ...\nI I again I doubt it would be fast tracked no because because it's it's not like the travel ban right that affected people immediately right so\nFeel with ... with what you could make the the executive branch could make the case and the travel ban that there was a an immediate threat that\nWe had people traveling from certain parts of the world that had been trained and that were coming here and that it was reasonable to review that\nIn parts of the world that had been trained and that more coming here and that yeah it was reasonable to review that process that travel

throughout the show as we uh we always do also coming up here in just a little bit uh what's destroying the planet your pet\nI knew it I've been watching her for a while she goes out and she you know especially on a sunny day she'll she'll lay on the grass she's just trampling the grass and just laying all over you know that she's not a small dog [noise]\nAnd ... says that if\nThe Democrats don't when the house she's going to move to Canada I thought all the celebrities will be out as soon as they said hey pot is legal\nWell here's the thing what she's saying that in January 'cause right now you know if you look at nature Silver's five thirty eight then ah okay and you know what I mean is that one of those same things\nTo say she no she doesn't have to leave right I'm going to pretend that I'm going to leave best right like way we are bad blood we know the Democrat is going to take the house we know okay\nShe no she doesn't have to leave right I'm going to pretend that I'm going to leave that's right look way we are bad blood we know the Democrats going to take the house we know that okay I'm going to make this proclamation well but what\nIs I think is the you know I mean what's what would be the the the goal was saying that I mean what you think that is going to do that people are gonna go man we better get out and vote for a Democrat otherwise Barbra Streisand's going to move to Canada\n[noise] yes I I Can't live in a country that bad doesn't live in\nI Can't\nI Can't [laughter]\nI just I Can't I Can't well but that's I mean because that's really if you think about it that's the underlying uh you know I guess thought behind saying something like that\nAnd it's just very important for you to understand and again we really we don't play those games we've said look you're not going to change that free speech exist and people the the the rhetoric has been heated in this country\nA for a long time yeah it's amplified now because social media exists so it seems like it's worse than ever remember when you use to personally insult the politician we used to have duels in this country\n\nYou will be challenged to a dual so that actually existed\nAnd and so yeah we don't deal with it but we understand we don't deal with that type of rhetoric on the show it's not how we want to explain we had\nA we have told people that agree with you know majority opinions that we have who sometimes use those tactics we believe it's wrong\nThat the left has to use it because they don't have anything to argue they can't argue the substance of the issues we can there's no need for us to do that\nThey need to do it because they're lost ... we're not last their last\nUh but when it comes down to it when you want to see the different reaction of right there\nThe letters that were set now the castor bean themselves were not toxic but it doesn't matter from what we know or the FBI still hasn't said whether those were alive explosives or not in fact we know one of them was not the one cent to CNN\nRight we know that was not a but when you look at it\nWhen you look at the reaction of the media to similar instances one ... and those are the these are emblem sent to the politicians in power right now\nTo a point to individuals in our military and the CIA\n\nWas there anything on CNN where they were blaming the left\nAnd that was there anything on Fox where they were blaming the left for no no it was just quiet this story came out of people moved up you know people moved on mhm said OK yeah brought brought back memories we talked about it brought back memories of nine eleven and then we moved on a good looks like they caught the guy\nBut now the charges officially filed last week during all the the\nUh uh\nCoverage of a you know the um the mail bomb scare ...\nWere they treated the same by the media for those were not biased we're not biased you can be biased by including one story and making accusations against one party on one story that shouldn't be related to them at all\nYou ignore the other story [laughter]\n[laughter] yeah I mean it it was not it it's it's as if okay yeah that happens fine I'm comes with the territory as Don Lemon right might say\nAnd that's it\nNow it's a given that high profile individuals politicians and presidents are going to be a target of a number of attempts\nTwice the secret services in place for presidents\nAnd it's why most people even if they're not serving the public there the even in the private sector or they're they have a high level very high level of security\nBut the point is is that the the media went all over when it works for when they believe it works for their side they\nStay on for a long long time they will it ... it is the story but it doesn't work for them politically if it's the other way around\nThey will it ... it is the story but it doesn't work for them politically if it's the other way around if the other side is targeted and\nWe can send that reminder to a bit of what happened is ...\nAnd the attempted assassination of multiple Republicans that's something uh Don limited CNN apparently needs to be reminded of\nYeah yeah I saw that yesterday that did come up yeah yeah in fact ...\n... ... you know to that one right\nWell the interesting thing is as they talk about the fact that have fallen spiteful about rhetoric in and bring it up is what causes these murders and then that's exactly what they proceed to do\nThat I was at the ah MSNBC is a a\nContributor Steve Schmidt ... said conservative radio host like rush and mark Levin have blood on their hands for mass shootings and other crimes perpetrated by crazy people\nHe also included judicial watch news busters judicial watch Breitbart judicial\nWatch what is there just to watch\nAll they do is to get the nation to the people they're not ... if you look at what judicial watch is about getting information I specifically documents right documented evidence or information to the American people\nOh oh oh\nForget it [laughter] and we can't have that\n[laughter] that see because the point would be from the left well you are you know your your part of the problem so you get people motivated by how well the world\n\nWould judicial watch could get someone motivated to do something violent and\nAny of the others by the way I mentioned in yet within that list but when you can't put judicial watch up in terms of controversy the only controversy there it is the only debate there's between the people who want the truth and the people who don't\nIn terms of why they exist and their attempt in their mission statement\nHas anybody ever debated anything that they have\nBeen able to uncover any documents that they have been ... been able to uh to essentially bring to light\nWell I heard that uh you know mark Levin dissected the fourteenth amendment in the constitution today so certainly he has blood on his hands white explaining the constitution mhm how dare he [laughter] [noise]\nWell but here's the thing by the way just when people do a mark works for the same company that we do but the people know that but yes\nUm but so no one at at MSNBC or CNN or any of the others are response now no\n[laughter] no I just would have to come out and and then accused them of of course being we're responsible for the attempted multiple assassination on that ball field on that day were Steve ... was shot\n\nBy a if you say one side is responsible you have to say the other side to ... there's no way to ignore that you can try to ignore that but you just look stupid doing yeah\nBut I what I just I Love in ... is the fact that\nAs they denounced the fact that heated rhetoric causes people to commit murder [laughter] they just gave and put it up with wild and in sane and crazy accusation\nYeah well\nWhat Michael Moore say revving up wrap it up so here you go\nThat's response will wrap it up\nThat's ridiculous I it was just so that would mean also that Twitter and Facebook and social media federal response to have to go the friday ought to have to go\nFree speech is the problem or anything that that any of these individuals who are actually responsible for this anything that they participate in\nAs responsible right well know anybody that they disagree with right yeah\nWell I mean I'm Talking about if if this person ... saying that your you know that that uh that that talk radio and\nOh by the way the way he called it just shows you watch uh he's he's labeled a former Republican strategist but he has no conservative and he's no no he's now he maybe he may be somebody who's he may be a case like [laughter] it's like John Case a plumb these\nOf critical thinking right we can just ended their he can call them\nBe a case like John Case a wildly absent of critical thinking right\nWe can just end up there he can call himself what whatever he wants to have you noticed a number of people that call themselves Republican strategist yeah and conservative who are not any that maybe they claimed they were at one time but they're not anything close to it but they wish to keep the label\nWell uh we get that we've had that for years on this

know we spent the first hour the shows are talking about the fourteenth amendment than birthright citizenship and\nAnd all that you just made an interesting point here\nBecause we we had gone back and and as others have and and you know did the research of the original writing of the fourteenth amendment and the senators were involved and actually writing it and you just made the great point here during the top of the hour you just are in our mid show meeting\nWhen you said well because we talk about the citizenship clause which was authored by a a U.S senator from Michigan and his name was ah Jacob power\nAnd during the debate of the fourteenth amendment have described\nIt he actually talked about the intent of the citizenship clause which was to exclude a it would\nExclude Native Americans who maintain their tribe a tribal ties and persons born in the United states who are foreigners aliens who belong to the families of ambassadors or foreign ministers\nAnd when you look at that because historians of have gone back over this\nYou have a lot of legal scholars right now saying well no because it didn't get specific what do you we often go to legal precedent and everything else and certainly go to this is not exempt from that they will cite legal precedent um but there is\nWe often go to a legal precedent and and everything else and certainly SCOTUS is not exempt from that they will cite legal precedent um but there is no greater in my opinion there is no greater legal precedent than the description of the intent\nBy its author the clause had an author who was very vocal during the time of the debate\nAbout the intent of that clause there is no greater president so we can go back and talk about our founders well what they intended what they are and we don't always have\nOn record you know the the the the thought behind\nA what our founding fathers set up for us now we go back we have the debate\nAnd I think you know the interpretation has been of a ... in terms of many things are but in terms of the constitution\nAh said hey we agree with the fourteenth amendment they didn't get specific though because Congress did it we are not going to change a hundred and fifty years of what the country has followed and apparently has thought\nIs the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment right that's what I if you were to ask me I don't agree with it but I think that's what will happen\nMhm [noise] yeah or or the SCOTUS or SCOTUS decides to say ah that the president can effectively change this through executive order that this would have to be an act of\nCongress to change this it would have to well it would have to be I mean what would they say would have to be an act of Congress or would have to be a ... another ... ... yeah I'm\n... it's I guess because at that point now you're approaching interpretation or them essentially having to interpret\nAnd and the fine at the highest level the fourteenth amendment and and really outlined who would applies to or whether or not it applies to the children of illegal failing it\nAnd then you'd have to go to the Nineteen fifty to a a part of the immigration naturalization act like a section I Believe it's I'm just memory fourteen or one as we met earlier that the ... Congress said okay you know we ... this is this is the law this could Congress except the ... you know the fourteenth amendment here\nAnd so you'd have to go back to Nineteen fifty two the justices to say OK did anybody even bring up the birthright citizenship but it didn't include it in any Congress purse or anybody who uh you know who who submitted this bill to Congress even bring that up\nBecause as far as we know that that wasn't an issue at that point why they did it more research has to be done as to why Congress did that in\nNineteen fifty two and what that specifically met\nOr if if Scott as were to decide to define who would applies to the uh the citizenship clause if they were to define clearly in a decision I don't think this is going to happen but if they were to do that would that\nNormal fi\nThat law from Nineteen fifty two\nThey've said is if if the law says otherwise and the constitution the fourteenth amendment or the ... the fourteenth amendment is clearly defined it if the if the Supreme Court heard it and the Supreme Court said\nNo here's what it says then the what Congress did in fifty two would be gone that's what I mean oh yeah yeah oh yeah the ... that law also right that they could one one ...\nAnd and that's the and fire protection which means that there's much but you have to get past that part and that's what I don't see happening no no I said earlier I don't think that's ... I don't think they're going to get to defining a very clearly what they based on interpretation who the ... look at us his ship clause applies\nTo a new look it up a gun lawsuits over the last ... probably\nA you know two hundred and forty years of the country and the two hundred and Thirty years before Congress irks me for the Supreme Court finally said the second amendment as an individual rights ... it took that long right\nEven though to me it was absolutely clear that it was an individual right as it was too many of us because we knew what the founding fathers thought go back to the federalist papers and you can figure that out quite easily\nStill it wasn't defined for over two hundred and thirty or some eight six six Ninety right I\nWas told that he ... he wrote a [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles than registered and joined the million mile club on line at red eye radio show dad come red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nThe tough tested valor sled is on the road the tough tested truck we'll be traveling the country at truck shows\nTruck stops and national retailers across the U.S stay tuned to read I radio for up to date to information and be sure to follow red eye radio and tough tested on Facebook Instagram and Twitter\nFor information on tour stop events and promotions if you see this truck take a picture posted on Instagram and be entered to win great prices at hashtags\nAttack this truck keep listening for us for the next stop\nIf I could take a picture posted on Instagram and be injured too when great prices at hashtags\nAttack this truck keep listening for us for the next stop near you\nAttention owner operators tired of chasing empty promises RSVP is looking for you to join the routine offering a dollar Seventy five per mile for ... drivers or two dollars per mile for teams are asked me ... all miles that hadn't back\nHome or not in their vocabulary they're no trailer rentals needed no secrets are I think the today an eighty eight RSVP three six five that's eight eight RSVP three six five four apply online an RSP P.

realized I didn't believe everything that they were saying\nThen I Googled Republican versus Democrat I like kinda both kind enough that's why I'm an independent it wasn't until the Trump versus Hillary election that I realize how important was to vote maybe they had to do with like society at all\n[laughter] ... every maybe\nOne I was following was like go out to vote I was in college in Massachusetts I decided that I wasn't going to go through the long process run out of state student to register to vote either hectic schedule I just didn't have the time and energy it's just not that important also I didn't know how my ...\nSure to vote either hectic schedule I just didn't have the time and energy\nIt's just not that important also I didn't know how my parents would feel about the whole thing because my brother does not bode either so it wasn't asked if they could to help us out with the registration and mailing all the forms to us\nSo she doesn't want to get by with their parents with my mom was a Republican and my dad is a Democrat\n[laughter] I Wonder if I ever bought a concert tickets on line\nYou know you asked yourself okay is there anything because millennials aren't stupid if they want to go to a concert or something oh man boom they pull up the up a boom boom boom boom they've got tickets right oh voting\nOh no no mailing things gives me anxiety toward the road ... here's your forecast\nThere is a line of showers and thunderstorms today extending from Detroit down to Texas said we're going to see this line of showers continue to progress to eastward slowly today\nA so an act of Congress can certainly be changed and\nOverruled by the court sulfide by the court also yeah so what you don't have a life if you if you had Congress come out today and and\nPass a law standing look you know that the Nineteen fifty two law was just an you know an assertion that that we believe in the fourteenth amendment but we as Congress do not believe that the fourteenth amendment\nCovered birthright citizenship that's up to the Supreme Court\nTo decide because we don't clearly see it in the in in the text\nAnd we believe that you know and and you you pass this law and so we we you know we either we either pull that Nineteen fifty law out or we amend the Nineteen fifty law to include the fact that we're not making a a a judgment on birthright citizenship because that and I I don't think you'll ever see Congress to that I'm saying they could do that\nFor a and and then at that point\nThe the courts would say will Congress was looking for what we believe on this to begin with now we're never going to see that that's a complete total hypothetical delusional [laughter]\nYou know delusional scenario 'cause it's not going to happen but I'm saying they couldn't do that but because Congress in Nineteen fifty two said that many believe that the courts will use that in order to differ and say nope sorry I'm\nThe Supreme Court gave that opinion in Nineteen eighty Ninety eighty when there wasn't a precedent that was that it was an opinion the opinion lean that way Congress didn't object to it when they basically approved of the fourteenth amendment in the Nineteen fifty two law so sorry you don't have standing as the executive branch yeah they could do\nLower courts can do that in the higher courts might refused to hear it\nBut it has never been my my problem is and this is where you know occasionally we'll talk about the failure of the system\nI Believe that we as a nation need to have when you have a a law\nThat clearly is and how it's been interpreted is not an amendment to the constitution which is clearly not being viewed by modern society as the\nMakers and the writers of that amendment and the people and the legislators but voted for that amendment back a hundred and fifty something years ago\nThat the Supreme Court does have to step in the times they did they did with the second amendment that was two hundred and Thirty years yeah a lot of federal precedent not Supreme Court precedent but there was federal precedent in there that was state precedent to their the\nSupreme Court came in and said sorry uh owning a gun as an individual right yeah yeah\nYeah thank you Scott we appreciate it I because yeah that\n... ... the\nArgument is often well it's been in place for so long this is what we've been doing up to this point that's really not a legal argument\nYou'll hear that if if they were to take this case if the if the let's just say this were fast tracked uh the the president issues the executive order it's challenging gets right up to the Supreme Court and ... and quick fashion\nI'm In the hearings you could you're going to talk you're going to hear the impact but the impact remember is on\nWould be on on on children that would be born to aliens and in in the future\nSo it's not on it's not even the we're not even talking about the legal status of anyone who was born here up to this point to a parents who were here illegally that's not going to apply\nThat's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of a revoking the citizenship of someone who was born\nTo work here illegally that's not going to apply\nThat's not going there is not going to be any grandfather ring of a revoking the citizenship of someone who was born here up to this point it would be those children\nBorn in the future to illegal parents and that's who would apply to and there's a certain a behavior there that is that is not immediately affected right uh we we often talk about the immediate effect like the travel ban well you and I had to go back and\nScreamed the word temporary how many different times because the media was making it play out like we were shutting the doors for ever\nOr on people coming from certain parts of the world and and it was in you know again it was played out and ended in a different\nIn a different way the media but it's not going to it's not gonna it wouldn't be the same in in consideration fear of what the impact would be because the impact would be future ...\nBut I'm a I'm afraid what you're going to have is you're going to have judges look at this and say\nCongress has never challenged what they did in Nineteen fifty two they never settle with\nCongress has never there's never been a push to change the way in Congress the way that this law has been interpreted the only thing from the Supreme Court was the opinion that is was not a legal precedent that was said that they believed it was an Eighteen Ninety eight and Congress has never fought that\nThere's never been a serious legal challenge it has been accepted that the interpretation has been there for a hundred and fifty years and you're going to have all judges even construction is judges even cabin on Gorsuch may look at it and say\nWell there really hasn't been a fight over this the second amendment there's always been a fight over\nA fight going on constantly for that and constant precedent being set on that on birthright citizenship\nMaybe not so much and they may look at it and say it's been this way for a hundred and fifty years it has a specific law about a specific type of behavior that we allow were gun rights could be every gun issue was a different issue in a different law and a different state\nAnd they might look at and say this is pretty clear that the interpretation\nWhether the author wanted or not but the interpretation taken and accepted by the country for a hundred and fifty years even if the author that was not what the author of the amendment thought it's been accepted all the way back not just recently that it should be changed that back in Nineteen Ninety eight that was their\nOpinion of the Supreme Court\nA lot of judges just don't want to touch it because they don't want to be the ones that change what they believe the country has come to a consensus of rightly or wrongly I'm just saying that's what they would that's what I think where I think it's going to go ...\nAnd it's a shame because you know and these things will happen in in any uh you know any republic any\nConstitutional republic where a law can be passed it will be vague and somebody will take an interpretation and it isn't challenged well\nAnd and that's that's what I Would say is that the ... it doesn't matter what society it doesn't matter how new or old the challenges if it's a new challenge that's never it a new challenge means that no one has ever stepped up to travel\nI buy agree with you on that is why it took two hundred and Thirty years to get you know the guns are and you know you have an individual right to bear arms in\nThis country yeah treasury Eighteen Ninety eight case would be different because you had parents who were here legally you didn't have the question of right what about the parents who aren't here\nRight legally but the opinion there was an opinion written which wasn't a precedent that made the claim that they are right that every court did which may be used and said okay that opinion was out there it's not legal precedent for but nobody ever ... challenge that and they were doing it at that time they were still allowing\nEven at that point you could be an illegal immigrant in this country and since it's been going on for ... it's not like it stopped for a hundred years and then came back again magically mhm that's the problem\nRight bullet hasn't been challenged uh so that's the question do we ignore it because it hasn't been challenged because nobody challenged it or not one sought to to find that claws well\nI agree with you I Will leave without question you have somebody on a ... look\nOr you when when you see that when if I was a judge and I said well look let me look at the original like looking at the federalist papers for the constitution you can't just look at the constitution say well I'm gonna flip a coin\nAnd and see where it lands that's going to be my opinion you go back and you look at the first to men or the second amendment as many of the justices ... the justices did you say okay what's\nIn the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking\nAnd er the second amendment as many of the justice as the justices did you say okay what's in the federalist papers what were the founding fathers thinking when it came to guns why do they want the second amendment what was it about and once you do that you know that was the original intent and you\nKnow it it's it's easy to come to a decision I agree with you I think they should do that mhm because there isn't a it isn't a law that just written specifically there is no specific\nIt it doesn't specify birthright citizenship\nIt doesn't state it's not this is what were you and I've talked about before if it's clearly in there like in the second amendment [laughter] and uh they still went back and look to do it it's not clearly in their ... it really does because\nThe argument would be made then in this case coming from the other side well\nIf if ah [laughter] if\nI'm Jacob power the senators who wrote the citizenship clause intended it to be a

M. A. L. washing comes to talk\nRadio aid to the tiny red I we\nGo to Vincent in Las Vegas Vincent welcome you are and what I Radio Welcome to the show Hi\nHey I'm not sure if I tell you guys all discussion but uh but I've always I don't understand why some people are saying or playing the birthright executive\nOrder for those by Trump or the president is stupid 'cause [noise] ... should they take care of order clarify law ... my understanding so why can't a president clarify what the actual author\nAnd you've got to talk about Jacob our intention in order to enforce the fact that the fourteenth amendment does not extend to bail ends or people vote for a nation get impersonation\nWhile the the executive order does not necessarily a clarify the interpretation of the fourteenth amendment it may attempt to but then beyond that the court challenge ultimately if it got the SCOTUS it would be the job of ...\nTo interpret that would be the right job of is ... it would be his job of his lawyers to defend it\nBut the secular border in a self uh is an executive order to change what the immigration\nA law is right now under birthright citizenship the explanation would be in the ... that his lawyers would give where he would try to make that point of clarify in the original author would be in the actual right\nIt would yeah and the actual court case so the decorative branches interpretation of it is not the the final say now now if I have a very pointed out\nThe president could write the executive order and if there were no challenge [laughter] that's a fantasy but if there were no challenge and it would it would stand and it would be the law the land\nWell yeah 'cause that was the question gardener yesterday which I thought was a stupid question kind of president writing an executive order to change the law and and what it hold on well yeah sure he could write an executive order for a ham sandwich I'd I don't know many challenges yeah then yeah but it's going to say there'll be an injunction\nThat there'll be an injunction and the law will never take place I'd like to be a brilliant move by the president and or the attorneys or or the Justice Department\nMaybe some input her idea and she's here to say that\nYou know less attempt to get this at at at least\nFor the president I I think it's it's a it's part of his his fight whether you want to put it just purely political or not it is part of the campaign promise from two thousand sixteen on controlling the borders and I think it's worthwhile fight and then we're with him on that on the spirit of it and thank you for the call but ultimately\nIt is going to be about\nUh you know getting it to the Supreme Court to have that interpretation or ... or at least the citizenship clause of\nThe fourteenth amendment if it got that far I don't I I don't know what I don't believe it ever will but\nBut still though when people say well he's just because she's just campaigning\nAnd an\nHour and ... why not viewing this is part of the campaign promise from Saddam's medics team\nThat's my my yeah that was where I was going exactly is the fact that well he's not campaigning\nI could see if you're upset saying he's just campaigning for example when you've got Democrats when you when you when you got to Claire McCaskill trying to paint herself as a Republican fried just who happens to be running as a Democrat yeah now that's something you should complain about because she's not telling you the truth right when you when you have now when you've got many Democrats trying to portray themselves\nAs oh we're not part of those crazy Democrats on I don't know where we're very very moderate they've gone back to that that you should be upset about when you campaign but Trump as president\nThis is what he's always campaigned on and one of the reasons one of the major reasons is he got elected was illegal or immigration\nAnd immigration issues across the board so anything that he does well he's doing it just to uh just to the campaign before the midterms well on the caravan thing\nThe only way you could make that point is if he financed the caravan which I don't believe he did I I don't think so and therefore when this is happening he's doing what he believes he should do\nMight help his campaign yeah but it's what he's always right on and if he's consistent in his opinion why would anybody it buddy be upset about it or college strictly campaigning strictly campaigning is what the Democrats are doing trying to pretend they're Republicans\nRight exactly that's a campaign in that you should be upset about\nThat would be an action and the president clearly knows this is going to be an executive order like this is going to be immediately\nBecause that would be an action and I the president clearly knows this is going to be an executive order like this is going to be immediately challenged in court he knows that\nAdded to that I told you about an old old friend of mine who I saw here in the last month and when I had last asked the question a few years ago how many cats and dogs do you have now she said seven cats and for dogs ...\nWhen I saw her recently I said hey how many catch you have now and she said well I have four dogs just said oh what I said what nine cats ten thirty three thirty three cats yes\nBurner spouse to actually put a extra room on the house so the cats can walk in and out to non heated room but that's where the cats can stay in congregate together hope but thirty three\nThat's three cases of cat food a day [laughter] [laughter] [laughter] I don't know which is being [noise]\nBut the study claims that human compulsion to seek out animal companionship is one of the primary factors affecting our climate by the way the two idiots overnight told you this was coming along time ago Belgium we told you this would be next\nResearchers at the University of Sydney in Australia claimed that those one hundred and sixty three million pets heavy detrimental impact on the environment from the food they consume to the waste that they produce\nIn the U.S there are more than one hundred and sixty three million dogs and cats that consume as a significant portion of their diet animal products and\nTherefore potentially constitute a considerable dietary footprint the study proclaims\nHere the energy and animal derived product consumption of these pets in the United states is evaluated for the first time as are the environmental impacts from the animal products fed to them including Finkel production\nThe problem isn't just United States now or the or just not the United states though the popularity of companion animals has grown worldwide Americans are the largest pet owners in the world I don't mean that means we're the fattest pet owners are we owned more pets probably both\nBut tradition of pet ownership in the United states has considerable cost as pet ownership increases in some developing countries\nEspecially China and trends continue and pet food toward higher content and quality of meat globally pet ownership ... compound the environmental impacts of human dietary choices it continues\nThere's only one solution no more pets\nReducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar help an emotional benefits would considerably reduced those impact the study concludes\nOne of the things we're talking about is the fact getting rid of your dog and getting a rabbit because the dog eats meat and the rabbit wants or the or that she has said it was yes so so what do we do with the dog\n\nWe supposed to put the dog down\nOr just after this dog not get another one I never search for a cat [noise]\nI rescued one had rescued you let's be clear right\nBy the way you're not the only person that said so that to me this week that I think we all know that\nAh [laughter] and a\nMango is a black cat just revised Halloween bomb Halloween and you know the funny thing is I had I had a a bug a few weeks ago and I had all the autumn stuff up already I had a a a smoke detector\nActually the smoke detector ... I thought it was a battery but smoke detector went defective and it you know ... you know yeah the toll is part of my house\nOf course so I you know so it's like fourteen feet up but I got this incredible ladder widened base and everything else so I was like you know Tim Allen very excited to bring that let her out and really tested capabilities right so I get up there and realize okay this is in my I I have a ... it's\nSort of an atrium it's my music studio ... where I got a little studio there piano all that stuff so but it's way up so I get up there take it off bring it down and realize it's not the battery so I order a new one on Amazon ... takes a couple of days so do I take down a ladder not leave the latter believe it or\nLeave it might take it out there so letters there for a couple of days and I noticed in the cat black that keeps walking under the ladder thought that if there's a lot so I figured that out and I'm like ... should I be worried about yeah that's a good luck thoughts I never had before\nUh but uh there's only one solution no more pets reducing the rate of dog and cat ownership perhaps in favor of other pets but offer similar helping emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts the other choice researchers recommend is\nThe ownership perhaps in favor of other pets that offer similar helping emotional benefits would considerably reduced these impacts the other choice researchers recommend is having your pets pets go vegetarian\nNope something that's not recommended by veterinarians are animal health and welfare experts who can see that having some type of meat based protein is best for your pets yes particular those for whose ancestors were carnivorous\n[noise] yeah I Can't get my cat to eat a carrot\nNo and so uh uh there you go the study of the researchers say isn't designed to dissuade animal lovers from taking in the maximum number of pets possible yeah it is yeah that's actually a point but to encourage Americans to consume less meat\nSo that's the point are and I see what they're saying keep your pets you go vegetarian I'm literally thawing to stakes right now I'm going to have both of them today\nI might have to go by a third one just because this article is making me hungry for meat [noise] my favorite one remember and this goes back ten years ago\nI think you and I ... the only been working together for a short time uh-huh remember the guy that came out that said that\nWe need to get rid of all the cities in the United states right and we need to have said he's no bigger\nThan twenty five thousand people ... and ... how ... what was it was it over half of the people have to go\nYeah we don't want to go to I think it was more than half we're gonna have to take them somewhere where do you do with them I don't know it's like we have to [laughter] what do you do with [laughter] and who decides who goes\nAnd and I think it was out of the of the probably the closing in at that time seven billion people we only have like one\nRight so what do you do with the what do you mean [laughter] okay what's what's your plan is going to be the weirdest lottery you guys ever heard of but here's how it works\n[laughter] are you committing suicide first right\nHey that'd be cool psi phi movie right at the end of the planet we're down to what ten years just some kind of doomsday whatever\nClimate suicide well it wouldn't be climate base because that would just be well then you'd have Hollywood would never make a movie where let's just say you know\nThe chunks of ice just start falling out of the sky or that the water rises in Manhattan over a period of three hours and then freezes over that period of ten minutes that would just be a stupid movie\nOr it would be called the day after tomorrow um [laughter] so [laughter] that's not making about climate change this time about whatever right\nBut if we could whittle it down to\nOne billion people and then it would be over the ... you could make this a series\nOr the period of years you know because you got ten years or Fifteen Years to figure it out to got to figure out how to deplete the population\n[laughter]\nI don't remember remember Star Trek deter remember how the the\nTwo forces are the two societies on the one planet right war with each other and instead of going to war and they simply killed people on both sides okay we're going to kill a thousand people that are you kill a thousand um they like managed war and then there was the other one remember all the people that were like plastered up against the wall hadn't the ... member that one\nYeah I don't they open the window and there were like all these faces on the wall like writing 'cause society had grown so much and I don't know how would they ever solve that problem\nYeah I don't remember that one of the one of the most interesting post apocalyptic type movies was children of men Clive Owen two thousand six\nUh haven't said was about essentially a the there was that women could not give birth there was whatever happened to the apocalypse they no longer have the ability to give birth and then all the all of a sudden they came across this woman who was pregnant\nSo you had to they had to hide her\nBecause all governments would want you know to a study this woman and then you know all of this and and they just wanted to protect her and her baby so she kind of went underground so they could protect her\nBut I mean that kind of gets into that area right of a population that basically\nAs lessening not in in the crazy way that the Democrats or talking these far out far left liberals are talking about\nAnd good in the past of depleting the population but just kind of a ... thing of okay there's only a billion we can only save a billion\nAnd it's a global thing right\nThere's only a billion we can only save a billion\nAnd it's a global thing right\nI mean there were ... it's it's not that it would be one of those those questions almost like a Sophie's Choice I mean they did it in deep impact yeah oh yeah that was very clear that that uh Well Bruce Willis ...", "year": "2018",
