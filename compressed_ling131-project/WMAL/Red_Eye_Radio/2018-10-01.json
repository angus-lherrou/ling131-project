background check it's not an investigation\nIt's very important to say that because there are differences between an investigation and a background check so we'll get to that coming up here in just a little bit now Democrats have been moving the goalposts to on this the one I loved yesterday well he might have perjured himself and what\nThe amount of drinking in high school really\n\nThat's that's what you've got no oh caves are where are you going to measure\nThe amount of drinking in high school yet so we'll we'll get to that you're a little bit a couple of things that we didn't get a lot of chance to talk about the economic things last week and and so with the the announcement the day that that a new United States Canada and Mexico\nTrade deal has been done and were stating that because no longer is it North American edge United States Canada and Mexico brand name has been changed\n[laughter] ah the aid of a couple of economic indicators are you know the month of July was was horrible I mean it was the the highest in five months for trade a deficits soybeans killed us or not being able to sell soybeans\nA Europe isn't going to be able to make up the majority of the story be lost if we have had and civilian aircraft got hit a real big in the in in July uh last week economic indicators coming out that ... you know because of the tariffs\nAre that were put into place just about a little ... about a week and a half ago that it was starting to hurt a manufacturing not only in China but the indicators in the United states you could see them going down as well you when I talked about this many times you can screen that you want to get\nThe trade imbalance down but the reality is the only thing that matters is economic growth that's a strong thing that the president has had right now you know that there are people in the White House like Larry Kudlow might not be Wilbur Ross might not be Peter Navarro but you know\nThe ... and they're telling him you cannot have\nThese kind of massive tariffs with Europe the United states Mexico and China it's going to kill your economic growth if you wish to be president in twenty twenty you've got to reverse course you've got to come up\nWith a ... a deal if you wish to isolate China politically you probably can survive that but you cannot isolate the United states from Europe Canada and Mexico you can't do that\nAnd so uh the the fact that this deal was done so quickly at the last second\nKnowing\nThe administration knowing that law Congress was not going to approve just a free trade deal and you're going to go in there and say okay fine nap is gone and nothing replaces is\nInto the going into the midterms and then uh wanting to have economic growth in two thousand Nineteen and\nNineteen and twenty twenty and you just said ... gone massive tariffs on China won't deal with Europe\nYou've got advisors to the president's saying you can't do this did you get a Christian or was the one they said that was the one that that got everybody to come down ... ... ... and there was one right read that to them while really\nWell I mean the reality is is that again uh you you head into the mid term you don't have something done you're not going to get anything done uh on the Mexico deals so you're left with nothing\nOr you get this when and claim you know you can at least claim that you're selling more dairy to Canada\nIf you can if you can call it a win which if you're selling more it's it's not less well look we so we ... we said this already\nThat they're you know to try to to try to regulate and international economy and sorry I Know people don't want an international economy but the reality is you can stop it\nAnd I can't stop ... you can isolate yourself but you can stop it it's impossible\nBut when you have as we talked about in Mexico per capita were day if you look at the trade going back in ... in fact a back and forth across the border and it's a tough thing to figure out because as we said before remember forty percent of what comes in from Mexico\nBut in a good comes in from Mexico forty percent of that good was made in the United states\nAnd the average product has crossed the border three or four times what was it four times they say it was four tires and we were suddenly in Mexico to begin with per capita that population for every dollar they ... that you know they sent to us we sent them three dollars for a smaller country\nThey've a third of the ... you know close to a third of the population of the United states Canada has like what one eight of the population in the United states and we were\nUh selling them like for every dollar they set us you know for every dollar you know we bought as in you know per capita that's per person in the United states have Canadian products per capita they were buying roughly eight to nine to ten dollars over the last couple of years\nPer capita is what we were selling them there were smaller country you're not going to equalize the trade deficit it's impossible\nOh there's no way you'll ever get there no\nI don't care how much more dairy you're going to sell them they'll never consume as much as the United states wanted to be close no\nSo uh again we'll see what comes out of this and it probably we you know start leaking out hopefully in the last next couple of weeks especially since now goes before Congress and we'll update on what's in there for ... here's your forecast\nWe're going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles with a chance of showers today we'll continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida\nThis is the difference between [noise]\nI'm\nA well this is exactly what ... what really got us here was the idea of putting all this on TV in the first place because now the left feels empowered to be able to change the landscape by screaming by shouting at you\nAnd they will be thanks to Jeff Flake\nSaying they believe they can win they in fact one of those shouting at him and that elevator\nWas all over social media on friday this is why we go direct going direct means getting in your face which means expect more of that were ever you are if you're a lawmaker oh I'm Sorry if you're a Republican lawmaker\nThey don't see they don't care about flakes hatred for the president\nThey don't care about his disdain for see I don't know if he was looking to coon by Yahoo situation\nNow he knew he wasn't going to win in November So we decided not to run\nThen he of course that's been going off on the president on a number of things holding up procedures and and and essentially are a number of items hostage so he can get his way\nHe was ... going to the left repeatedly\nWhat see Mr flake they don't care about you or your disdain for Trump you can be an agreement for that disdain with them they don't care 'cause you're still the bad guy\nSo he goes in and he of course\nDecides he's going to hold up to vote\nI'll I'll support it in committee but I'm not going to support it\nOn the broad vote\nWell\nThere you have the essentially the door open for others to say okay we support that as well\nSo now you have the background check\nNot in this is not an investigation no it does not know it it has a background check with a series of interviews\nHit as they've done several already they're gonna do another one and the scope is limited and see the liberals got on onto the president for limiting the scope well this is only about his the accusations but it does include the mirrors accusations not just the Ford accusations fright\nSo now you have again the claim being made and now it's going to be ... by the way we could have done this\nJuly thirtieth with a Ford accusations\nAnd you got what the FBI going back and doing interviews they will not make a decision they will just hand their report to the White House the White House will send it to the Senate\nThat's how that all this is going to work\nSo you delayed it by\nA week [noise]\nOr if you're the Democrats you realize this thing is going to go nowhere and you start screaming perjury [laughter] while the house isn't gonna bring up perjury charges perjury for what exactly what specifically and where's the proof that he lied about it\nSee the problem with the Ford allegations\nIs that you cannot they ... they\nThink it's impossible to prove or disprove based on what has been present well\nThey initially jumped on the fact that there were a a of friends of a Ford who said he lied when he said but he lied about his drinking right how\n[laughter] just how is that I\nYou know he talked about the fact that he drank and mhm\nAnd high school he likes very still like spear right you know and and\nYour because he would have to get down penny studied ever order in every study ... he never he said he never blacked out right now but he said he fell asleep after drinking ... which might have you know but but how do you\nWhat do you get my reading that you you don't know if he blacked out or not so how do you get 'em on perjury for that but I I don't I don't understand\nWell you know what's interesting here is if we're going to go off on that then then what about every person who wants to run for president\nBecause I don't know I remember a Brock Obama and the and and uh and him smoking pot and the story of him\nSmoking pot and paying are all this but they're just sending the perjury of it oh no no no I Know just the bird but but the point is the perjury is what goes back to we want to label him as a bad guy he's a liar he's a blackout fall down drunk right\nWell then this is and then you've got the pushback of course on Sunday\nFrom a Lindsey Graham and and others are where it was you know look this guy is not a stumbling drunk\nBut essentially goes back to label labeling him Kavanaugh as such\nFrom high school oh gosh ah I thought we set that standard with Bill Clinton with with ah with Brock Obama and others oh it only matters is if he's if he leans right\nIf he's a threat to the left\nThen we're going to shout well we never you never heard of a guy drinking beer in high school really\nWell I I what I also love was how they move the goal post were first on friday a and part of Saturday it was he's two part just\nBecause of his reaction attacking the Democrat asked the ... that he was ... that that he was too partisan right and and can't cannot survive he doesn't have he he doesn't have it takes because he's two part pulled apart that turned into because then the\nThe uh uh the report came out about ... Britain's Ginsburg back in twenty uh sixteen where she said ah of that um\n[noise] uh\nShe calls trumpet fake her ... she's getting involved in politics you shouldn't be getting involved in politics and this is a direct accusation and you buy individuals' mhm he didn't take on and say the entire Democratic Party he said you while nine ... written in in one story\nAh because there was no promise a that he could he could a ... he could rule without bias or something to that extent and I thought are you kidding me you've got Sotomayor on tape on record\nSaying it is the job of judges and justices to legislate from the bench\nThe whole thing is this is it because if it were another let's say Elena Kagan\nAt the president nominated now there would still be objections\nWould probably be the objection [laughter] if Trump he must be up to something I mean he could have nominated Merrick Garland oh no no no no no no we look further into Merrick Garland and he's the wrong choice I mean it it it would have been something some kind of objection\nBut for the media [laughter] that\nThere's no promise that Kavanaugh would leave is biased as side\nRight and I was you what first of all that they still don't get it right but then they dropped that they dropped that in became his temperament it became his anger\nIt wasn't that it was directed that because once again is burg thing came out of the women Ginsburg's been political all the time and then they had to drop bats and they went to the next thing they moved the goalposts again which is his temperament and you know Feinstein has gone to the you know as a petition or the or the or the ADA too uh uh to change their um\n[noise] uh uh their ranking up him as a from well qualified and because of his temperament because of his screen or because of his anger\nMhm yeah right\nThat's where they've gone I mean and so it's just they just keep moving the goalposts above the girls holds the goalpost because Grassley and flake let it happen\nThey allow them to move the goal post and here we are and it will be two weeks\nEssentially passed when it should have happened the vote\nSo that's on them\n... ... but did they have the numbers last week while they wouldn't have without flake\nThey're talking about friday there's broad either they have the number they didn't have the numbers and had no choice well apparently this is where it they've changed according to reports\nHis flight was able to convince the others a handful of others to get on board and support the background check\nBut otherwise da da da da da da da da da da da and said you know he doesn't have the temperament disturb because he got angry excuse me somebody you're not just beautiful ... they they sit there and they accuse you they do not not

on Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety a red I just uh reading her this is a\nTown hall or the Kevin ... ten reasons yep yeah we'll we'll we'll clear Cavanaugh I'm In the supplemental background\nCheck to witness was Bob will be interviewed all agreed to fully cooperate they will answer questions asked and an ... give the same answers they've already given under oath and under penalty of felony perjury if their answers differ from what they previously said\nThis is something I I was talking to a family member when this was announced on friday and I said here's where it's different\nBecause you can compare forged testimony to her what she told the Washington Post the Washington Post things could change drastically\nBy the time she testifies and some things did change\nNow what's different is of course the Washington Post doesn't have prosecutorial power doesn't have there's no bearing there there was no nothing that was said and this is not a criminal investigation so she wouldn't be charged with with lying to investigators here with the FBI bought it is official record after she testified so this\nAfter she testified so the standard is the testimony given on Thursday mhm she hasn't been interviewed yet not Ramirez has not testified under oath\nShe has been interviewed according to reports on Sunday so at some point Dr Ford is going to be interviewed and our first story changes after\nSworn testimony\nThen that opens the door to perjury\nAnd the report will go to the White House and then on to the Senate committee wants to White House reviews or that report which will come later this week and mark\nJudge said he would fully cooperate right ah in in this investigation even though he did write another letter over the weekend ... uh to the Senate Judiciary committee the FBI will for a second time along with Maryland authorities as well as every prosecutors is looked at this evidence admit that there is no felony federal jurisdiction here mhm\nUh after the Democratic party attempted to have capital arrested on Saturday [laughter] merely officials reiterated their findings by their standards are worst charges possible would carry a with them a one year statute of limitations additional prosecutors run record setting the evidence is insufficient\nTo merit a basis for even a search warrant much less than a rest we said that already before that you couldn't even get a rent a grand jury would even indict\nWith all the law enforcement bodies are well\nWhat all of the law enforcement bodies continue to point out that there's a lack of time and place and while the accuser was a hundred percent sure that something happened the accused and three witnesses or a hundred percent sure they were not witnesses to any event resembling the description of what\nThe FBI or will also highly greater amounts\nOf evidence against Dr Ford her fear of flying her miss remembering her one hundred percent clear account of the mysterious Safeway second door if it only had one her complete inability to figure out how she got to work from the incident and the continued repudiation by her best friend that such a gathering occurred with her president is likely to tip the iceberg\nWhere else do you go you talked to the witnesses\nOr and\nThen at that point it's done so if it's done by Wednesday and it's still to say\nDo you see the ... I cannot see the Republicans delaying it any further\nNo I don't know that do have the votes um if it comes back early ah I'm I'm I suspect that are that you will have further scrutiny you know and and it could be a Jeff Flake or anybody else\nBut your ... this comes down to the votes of those people who were on the fence\nWell if they if they interview him or mirrors and anybody she wants the interview\nAnd anybody who's come forward that will likely by the way that that part of it will likely that claim will likely take the longest\nThat likely is more involved because of the fact that it was not a part of public record Dr forged testimony is a matter of record and there's only so far I think with Dr Ford's case there's only so far you can go\nAnd it would basically be the parameters would be everything that was outlined in the testimony\nWeb but I mean politically if they get ... and you know and they get her you know they do an interview with her and everybody else surrounding it which means they've expanded the investigation beyond just won some southern Democrats can't make that point\nNo they'll try to but no there's not going to be they didn't have a point to begin with but what can they build what's allowed when someone like ... did what he did\nWill will the Republicans at that point move on and by the way did you see the story to it got a little bit of publicity that ah the ah the weekend poll that came out of the poll boosted friday or Saturday and showed Holly up two points\nOn I'm I'm On tester no no no I'm In I'm\n... yeah well it and and we wondered about a Claire McCaskill McKay if that if that was that there was going to be a last minute yes vote although politically I think it would be too little too late or it could be\nPotentially we'll see I think what happens um you know later this week but I think the hesitation\nBy those senators who backed this that you know the further investigation the FBI background check then I I think politically they can be damaged even if he's confirmed\nYou did the damage anyway you allow the circus to go on created more of a circus as a result of it\nAnd we know flake is not up for reelection which is why I think it it became more convenient\nRight the the other the other senators likely jumped on board a you know and and by the way they ... they did so potentially at their own peril politically but flake had to be the guy because he's not up for reelection\nHe had to be the one that went forward and requested this and the president you know comes in and says okay fine\nBy the way for what a two weeks better part of two weeks Democrats have been screaming at the investigation at the FBI investigation story from the hill the headline White House defense FBI invest [laughter]\n\nThey got their investigation now they're screaming about it\n[laughter] let's go to Robert in Johnstown New York Robert welcome you're on run I Radio Welcome to the show Hi Robert\nHow are you guys doing real good thanks for calling from [noise]\nI got a point but uh you asked how far this go after the interview everybody I think they should do is kinda got to see if there was any inappropriate behavior\nBecause uh [noise] anyway [noise] way\nWe understand your we understand your point [laughter]\nI mean really how those two women a cameraman getting all of a U.S senator in that building that's what I Want to know\n[noise] well I it's again it was it was pretty crazy with if you if you uh were following\nThe procedures on friday morning with the committee and then you have the Democrats walking out\nAnd then they were of course outside doing their own press conference and everything else so\nYou had a ton of chaos fight I'm with you but that's it's not I guess as secure as you would think even for senators it's not as secure as most people would think it is [noise] and that says\nAll this sort of the Senate is it was ridiculous shattered [laughter]\nI Know that was the target yeah right right yeah that would be the right up but that would be the target yeah I mean that would be the target that they would be looking here or I understand it does seem like you're you're the question in your mind is seems set up huh [laughter]\nI Would have to say yes that that that that ... that set it up right right oh I just I knew the way they can front of me and they made a good point and so I Do agree with them yeah and and that's when I say\nYeah I'm a cameraman right what do you what do you\nKnow who I Am all people or the whole [noise]\nWhile at the age have it's likely was getting to it's inevitable point and and also Lindsey Graham is probably the perfect person in that case\nBecause he has crossed the aisle so many times\nI think a lot of people in that regard likely didn't see it coming and also didn't see it working the way it did and building momentum\nAnd while ultimately it didn't work [noise] uh in in in moving the process forward\nThanks to Jeff Flake it did it did I think build even more momentum for Republicans in general we'll see if that translates in November at election time but uh five weeks from tomorrow by the way\nWell so but I but I Do think that Lindsey Graham actually what what do you know the what he said I I think he I this is what he believes that oh no no I I think it was all I think it was old school you understand what the Senate's roll into advice and consent\nAnd and as you said that's why he brought up sort of my or we are I'm sure that he had problems with ... and ... and the things that they believed ... but that isn't the job the job is in the job is to say\nAs a senator who was never supposed to be the job of senators to say do you agree with me at every point\n\nAh no All right well then I'm going to defame your character as a justice right right but that was that was never the role to begin with this are you confident the president gets to pick\nWho he wants on the Supreme Court yeah no I don't think it was pre determined I didn't mean to imply that it was pre determined that that Lindsey Graham\nIt just happens that he was yeah a pick to do that uh it just so happens that he did do it and he really was the perfect person to do that in that setting eight six six Ninety ...\nJoined the conversation using the shell wrote several hotline eight six six nine

against having off more than ... coming up here is just momentarily other stories out there must have got a slap on the hand any\nEr yeah you know this is a interesting the way this thing went down because as a the developments on Thursday came out essentially the Iran mosque and his lawyers early in the day had reached an agreement\nWith the FCC saying and and then apparently that whatever the agreement was was going to happen and then by the end of the day there were pulling out of the agreement and he was willing to fight it\nOut of this all stems from him saying basically that he was going to take the company private and that he had access to fund\nOr he done that some time ago and as a publicly traded company the chairman of the board and CEO you can't say that because you're a centrally by that statement especially if it's on true\nAnd that was the whole point is is that did he actually have the funding was it was a secured had been promised to him a any evidence that that he had access to funding to take a private\n[noise] that started this whole thing into okay and then of course the or some other things that he has done on social media that question his ability to run the company\nAnd the company but this especially because you're manipulating the stock price or the company uh it had to jump when he announced that the stock price at a jump because it was you know people investors if it were true\nMight have been able to make good on something like that uh and do well if they drop the stock up\nBecause he would have to buy out all of that existing stock\nThen it came out on friday which was interesting actually late or Thursday and friday morning\nThe investigation showed that because he came up with this price of\nFour hundred and twenty dollars per share\nAnd according to investigators he actually used for twenty four reason that everybody suspected on the Internet he was trying to impress his girlfriend according to investigators\nWith the Ford twenty price and of course it's relation to pot and he was also seen smoking pot on a pod cast\nThat not only are there more news sources out there\nBut you just brought it up ... not not only they're more news sources out there\nBut you have to realize that heart access to information to find out exactly what's going on\nIs greater than it's ever been before we were growing up mhm they could say whatever they want and if you want to research it it would take serious time to do the research to actually know what was going on yet might we said the people were actually more informed back\nThen they are today or because they did the basics first they actually learned and paid attention to and knew the basic ideas on which this country was founded\nWell they were taught to base and now you don't have any of that so what do you have\nPeople thinking I guess they don't have to learn it because they can Google it if they need it well they're not even willing to do that but when you know the basics of how government works or how ... works then you can have the debate on the ideas regardless of who's reporting what regardless of who takes what position\nYou can have the debate on the ideas\nBecause it's not about the people it's always been about the ideas and the one idea that this country was founded on was was liberty freedom and so you start there

Ninety\nOr read I let his head back to a year we go to Mario in Florida Mario welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show\nWell thank you yeah my my uh my thoughts on that uh that the judge Kavanaugh are that the old Bolshevik slept Dianne Feinstein Chuck Schumer even at the Lowes they are they're going to continue to attack him\nA even after he's confirmed as as the Supreme Court justice for sure the ... and I have another question\nIs will they they they made but it's not going to go anywhere you know no one will let her know once it's once it's done I mean I I think the focus elsewhere because once you get on the Supreme Court this whole thing about threatening to impeach him that's not going to happen\nNo no that's not at the Sacco hangs early there's nothing that's going to happen Rob the the the uh the lip service will continue Mario no doubt\nRight but I but I think they'll move on I think they'll move on to other things where they can have more control over\n[laughter] I I say what you mean yeah the the lip service that's what it is the target is the lip service and I think that they'll continue to attack and that\nBut that that's the norm they call that Tuesday right they'll they'll they'll attack him when they're say Supreme Court decision that I don't like that on their door to get in on something right on funny because Mario uh uh Gary and I were talking during the break\nAbout the the question by George Stephanopoulos asking one democratic lawmaker over the weekend or do you think judge Kavanaugh should recused himself from any case involving if he ceded any case involving a democratic lawmakers and the lawmaker comes back and says well yeah so I think that would be the\nWell in that case I can I can make the case that if you're a male you should not be you should recuse yourself from any case involving a female and if you're a female the same the same applies and then beyond that\nIf you are a in a ... a heterosexual marriage you should recuse yourself from any decision involving gay marriage or a or vice versa or\nI'll take it to the most extreme level if you are not the person in the case [laughter] you should read humans yourself because I couldn't possibly understand if you're not the defendant who are getting you know the person I'm making under ... you have no standing\nOr one of the interesting Congress ... plays\nOne of the interesting conversations I got I got an over the weekend with a with a few other people which was\nWell how come it's only only one of the fifty three genders ... have to be believed right only the allegation from one gender what about the other fifty whether it's at fifty three fifty four genders uh the the that are out there and then we just got into the bizarre conversations of of\nWhy don't you believe the other genders and going through the specific other genders and why they should have\nThey should or shouldn't be believed it was an interesting conversation about for video road here's your forecast\nFor going to pick up a lot of moisture for Southern California and western Arizona as the remnants of hurricane Rosa come ashore through the early part of the week there's a low in the Pacific that's combining with the system that will create some unsettled weather\nMost likely as far as Los Angeles where the chance of showers today will continue to see the chance of rain along the Gulf Coast from South Texas over to Florida you'll note we've already seen some snow and the higher elevations of the mountain regions of some of the northern tier states\nYou know we can keep it anonymous in the in the FBI in Korea but after that if you wish to continue than your name will become well known she didn't do that now\n\nAnd so everything along the line of [laughter] who paid for the the ... you know a ... lie detector uh the the suggestion of a law firm and everything that has gone and then you get to the point where they leak or name\nAnd\nYou know they they they link her name the people that were supposed to protect her and that has to drive somebody like Lindsey Graham just out of his mind ... as it as a dead he feels he has been completely betrayed our point is you're just learning that now\nWell it's like Jeff Flake you know I I'm I'm guessing he thought at some point he was going to make friends with a lot of people on the left remember he was doing the whole ... thing when he announced he wasn't going to run\nYou know this isn't this isn't a the way it should be uh the politics has gotten so ugly\nBut on friday he was being cold out and even after he decided to go to the White House basically a nasty administration request demand really but he was not going to vote on the floor\nHe would in committee but not on the floor for the confirmation\nThen as soon as that came out there were others basically on the left coming out and calling them out still\nBecause they if they believe in this to my approach is never about working with the other side or coming together the two sides coming together it's Republicans coming over to the left\nThey don't hail Joe Manchin\nIs somebody who is bipartisan while technically he is but he's not getting them he's not getting any points with his own party now he doesn't get any praised for no no McCain did all the media doesn't praise them no\nMcCain did I mean after McCain was littler after he ran for president right and then went away and was no longer a threat\nYou know and then and then after his passing he was praised by the left but it's always someone on the right who goes left it's not the other way around let's go to Peter in New York City Peter you're on right on radio walked into the show\nBut I Do very good with say more bloody and brought the investigation that sort of like to find out a little more about this stock the high school college\nAll heard have oh you mean expand the investigation on her\nShow all upset\nAbout her fishes so hey this is this better just as bad as just shoot it Vegas they didn't know about that when I hear nothing about her\nWell you know here's I guess this'll be my my point on on forward we just found out who she was so of course you're going to know more about Kevin up and you're going to know about Ford but it's a it's it's coming out\nMhm\nWell if there's a number of things that that I think as a as a part of the investigation if they're doing it the way that I Believe they would be doing it I remember it's a background check so the I guess the the the players that have been named in this so far\nMight not be what the FBI limits themselves too and and discussing it with foreigners according to her attorneys as of late Sunday she it's still not yet been interview well my question is\nYou're going to start with Kavanaugh likely because it's a background check on him you start with Kavanaugh but then you're going to go into all these claims you're going to try and find separately separate from the testimony\nYou're likely going to go and and interview maybe even family members somebody who could back it up because what you're trying to do the idea is to see if there's anything at all at the White House or the Senate committee should question in his background\nAnd you have to substantiate those claims\nSo there could be a number of people here that we're not even thinking of\nThat could be interviewed during this process\nAnd that might not be good news for Dr Ford or her attorneys\nAnd the guy I mean are probably going to interview the guy from Gail who said no he he\nDrank more ... right it's like I don't know where that goes well how can you qualify it and how can you\nYou qualify it and how can you prove it you know and that's that's the ... and plus it has nothing to do with this it's got nothing to do with the original case so it's it's it's a basically there's this old classmate from Yale claiming that he perjured himself right\nSo we'll see where that goes how do you perjure yourself in the amount that you drank did you see 'cause I didn't want to buy it right now there was there was no ... and there's no proof right\nHe hasn't been asked about that specific incident right\nSo it's there it's it's not perjury unless you get to that point to ask him about a specific incident and you of evidence that he lied but the the consumption of alcohol and what's amount you talk\nAnd your judgment of it compared to somebody else's judgment thirty five years ago it would be an interesting perjury case\nRight [laughter] so I don't well because then you would need a somebody in the house to start that that case against him and that's now that's not going to happen to them\nAnd they'll they'll see that they will interview this person like they'll interview everyone and they'll determine whether or not anything was by that person's claim can be corroborated not just what Dr Ford claims but what any other person related to the situation claims they're going to look to\nHave those claims backed up by somebody else\n[noise] Marty in Saint Augustine Florida Marty welcome you're on the radio Hi Marty\nYes I'm a first time a color hair and I think personally from Daytona Beach but uh\nI I ... I was a Trump volunteer for an entire year for a\nCampaign and uh I watch every rallied including the one that thrown in a way in West Virginia and there's thousands of people outside and you got people in fact I Am convinced [laughter] say you're going to see some Democrats flipped a specially the one in a\nA West Virginia and even a ... a\nDakota as well and that even includes Donnelly a senator Donnelly out of Indiana so I think that's where it's going to come from a a because the pressure is so great for re election and running some great cat were running great candidates this year [noise] ah in three states\nAnd we could they could pick up to the three yeah let's take it on the stick could start [laughter] ah caving themselves you know as supporting Kavanaugh\nFive yeah I don't know I mean if they didn't if ah I I I don't think it's about getting Democrats I think it's about keeping the Republicans\nAh I did think earlier might have been they might have been able to get last week maybe some of the reports that were out you know again Tylenol had the report their source report that ended up not being right ah that ah you know that they had a they had the votes that's my question if they had the votes why did they call for this right\nAnd well and here's my ... because\nRight after um flake came out others jumped on board saying yes they want the investigation too so it tells me that they went back into neutral territory there was word that came out a believe from ... camp early on that he may not be in support on friday\nThat he may not support the nomination\nI think it comes down to those four who were in that meeting\nA mansion Murkowski Collins and flick\nI think those were the ones are those are the ones to watch I wouldn't count on Heidi Heitkamp\nOr done like in this case and I think I could have said said the same thing on friday at if if the whole thing didn't happen I think I you probably could have set out on friday that on the broad vote you are not going to get those those boats\nSo we'll see what happens later this week but [laughter] it's\nFrankly politically speaking especially right now and especially with this situation friday is a

... great show great show first time caller here I'll be brief but I have a real problem with uh [noise] it ... the Democrats is as well as the Republicans was giving the doctor so much praise and\nTo me it was\nIt was there was no competition to me she said she was just totally full orbit or hurt education [noise]\nUm she didn't come off his ... to ... uh for one thing [noise]\nI myself when this was a theory that I'll be ... and you guys talk or you can talk about it but I'm sick and she was a little from the get go I mean even I think cabinet all was just happened to be the one\nI think she was on the on the road getting ready to run with federal were with federal which whichever nominee\nA guy [noise] um [noise] it's just that she was too much ... when she said she believed a hundred per se but it was capital right there I mean\nWell I mean I I I Will tell you this I mean when when they say that she's credible as I said the reason she is incredible is because you only remembers one thing\nYou're credible because there's a consistency to your testimony that's why when anybody and I would love ... never happened but I Would love to interview one of these Democrats who say she was credible\nHow forget about the fact that her own witnesses you know there is no forensic evidence and know witness even the ones that she names and ... story but the fact is what she said herself\n\nIf you just came in and say well look how couldn't remember this so clearly but you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this you don't remember this her testimony alone irrespective of the other ... evidence or lack of evidence her testimony itself\nWas not credible mhm yeah I mean that's the that's what a centrally was at play here\nWas responsible for leaking it but it doesn't matter and that's the attitude on the left which by the way if it's clear it doesn't matter because they leaked it\n\nNo one's even try handed a ... point and their their pay with it yeah it's a great point they're just ignoring the question\nAre we now a ... he did say Lindsey Graham did say they're going to do an investigation on it I guess we'll get any he called for an investigation recall dental one yes yep let us go to Lee in Chapel Hill North Carolina Lee welcome you're on Radio Welcome highly\nCare good show and you're listening to thank thanks I or so left ... strolling and pull a Ford last week says she ... member where all happen\nWhat he or she said she couldn't remember what year it if I stay right now she got\nBut right now she got there how shall I get back into a ... kilowatt she had to wait\nFor the yeah you you would have to you and we have that you will have to wait ... lawyer would act like you would have\nTo ask the Democrats that question I Can't answer for the Democrats are as I as I said very easily\nThat's why she's not ... that's why that alone she's not a credible witness unless there were people to bakar up when they say she's credible on like based on what and this is a legal statement is is it a personal statement against her right I don't know what she went through\nBut when you say I'm a hundred percent somebody did it where\nI don't know when I don't know how did you get there I don't know how did you get home I don't know\nAll you know as he did but any information surrounding it and then the witnesses that you give give contradicting testimony that you gave stock credible right\nThe ... and that's why I said I don't know if somebody has asked the Democrats that specific question but again as you see for example George Stephanopoulos last question when they don't answer it just moves on it's like okay give me an answer\nYou want it look as something that bothers me more than even even the the the ... which we call the fake news is the lack of guts of journalists to say I'm not leaving this question until you answer it right because it's important that there's an expectation yep [laughter]\nRemember who know who who was it who asked to Obama the follow up question where was that was that ... that was here in uh in ... was wasn't oh no yeah yeah yeah well there were two separate ends okay or one where you have a local reporter here\nAh from WFAN ATV in Dallas but no the one you're referring to was Chris Wallace and then they came back and said well we weren't told there would be fall of ...\nThat is that if you asked a question didn't make sense to be a follow up question right\nThat there's actually an and this is something that has to stop this ... this kind of buzz sorrow world respect that we have for politicians when I'm a journalist and I ask you a question if you don't answer it I'm going to ask the question again and then I'm going to come down the right to it and say you're not answering my question\nWell I don't feel it's important oh so you won't answer my question I Want you on record that you don't have the guts to answer my question I phrased it that way which of course is not permitted because there is some kind of bizarre real world verse back but a journalist is supposed to give\nA politician who won't answer\nA question on an issue but as the reason that you brought them on the air with you ... don't waste my time if you're going to be come on the show had the guts to answer my question but if you're going to be gutless go away I feel like I'm Talking\nTo somebody right now and yelling at them but if you're dealing at all of them and and you know that's but that's that they get away with it drives me up for you know because people like well\nStephanopoulos than everybody else allow them to get away with it [noise]\nThe the person especially a public servant who's being interviewed does not dictate the questions I\nDon't know I Know\nAnd what will they do when they don't answer the question they do when when when they don't answer the question they are dictating the question\nWell and that's just they need to it it's very clear to us but it's just said we're going to help this person to build a narrative here so let's talk to them\n\n[laughter] let's help them build their own narrative\n\nYeah we'll forget journalism right\nOh I'm Sorry then my question isn't the one I should be asking oh\nMy focus should be elsewhere you're saying well okay and and the easy thing to do is the challenge her own owes answer as soon as she gave that non answer I Would have said okay so you're saying the Democrats did\nYou like\nYour your your or\nNon answer their tells me that you're basically admitting the Democrats did\nLakes is\nYou can respond to that state but if you'd like to yes or no\nTrue or false\n[laughter]\nThis is why people right or at least frustrate the daylight Saddam ... this is why people hate it no but you're going on with Tim Russert because they knew it didn't matter which side they run they knew they were going to face tough questions\nIt's remember for two weeks in a row none of the Democrats from the Senate Judiciary committee would come out with Chris Wallace for what they do is is if you do that\nYou become black balled yeah\nThey won't come on your show any more because you demand that they that they answer the question everybody knows what the questions are going to be [noise] yeah\nWhen you come in with look when you're a a senator and you come in to talk or you're the president or whatever you're somebody the White House when you go on a show you know why you're going on the show ... they'll tell you we want to talk about this\nAnd so you know what the general questions are going to be and your goal is okay oh look I Need to get my step around here we need to figure out how to way not to answer any of the questions out of white filibuster\nWe the every journalist knows everybody on ABC CBS NBC and Fox knows that's what is CNN they all know it's going to happen mhm they all know they're going to do that when it's somebody gonna finally say uh you know the answer my question would you answer the question\nAnd at that point what happens is you're not going to get the major you're not going to get the major personalities anymore think about this we live in a society\nWhere the media believes we need to get the major personalities on the major political personalities who run and dry this country it's important that we get them on the air so they won't answer the questions that we asked them\nYeah that's it\nFace the nation no its face the other way [laughter] meet the press that was perhaps the me we're going to do a handshake that's the way it's going to we were just going to go out there and pat each other on the back\nUnless you're a Republican and this week is weak this mhm where there's\n[laughter] your mom [laughter]\nI might\nAs well be having that answer to every question here mom [laughter] what do you think that you're a mom [laughter]\n[laughter]\nYeah [laughter]\n... because that's the ridiculous nature of this why not just make it\nWhy not just make it I Would have a group of buddies I went to grade school with and we play this game of grade school Scrabble ridiculous Scrabble the words actually you got to make up a word nothing could be a real war word\nAnd you've got to use it in a sentence when you put it on the board\nAnd as long as you choose this [laughter] [laughter] okay [laughter] so that's what I Would just make it a game [laughter] because that's all it is exactly nobody's taking a the their constituents\nAre seriously in the case of a Jeff Flake he didn't care ... ... you know how she could answer it\nI don't know I don't know who would yeah I don't know like you're asking me a question I Can't answer right why didn't we but why didn't we get the I don't know that's a great ...\n[laughter] this is an old man [laughter] ah\nBecause very as they're not or a very observant yeah yes and it's not Democrats you might think Mr coups and all of you may think that Jeff Flake is a hero\nI'll say what I said earlier friday is a long ways away Trump just got back into the game that can often be very dangerous for Democrats\nEight six six Ninety red eye
