J. H. G. which did streaming and cover it\nWhich did streaming coverage um um\nBasically when when we went off the air they started their streaming coverage and and continued until they lost more than just power they lost power at their transmitter sites and that was pretty much game over for them but they were only twenty feet above\nSea level they were confident that their staff was going to be safe in that situation but they continue to keep an IT guy on board\nTo make sure that they kept feeding that and so they set another sister station and our system through and this gentleman and garage I\nAppreciate his honesty because wedding basically did was documented where he was\nWhere he was standing yeah and and and and smartly I'm not going to go stand out there by the edge of the parking garage but what I found interesting was that that parking garage was also home for countless people in their cars yeah\nYeah I just the ... is his name and a lot of people were following him a Drudge Report actually even put up a lead a early Wednesday and uh and he had been during that time basically staging and showing\nYou know the well a calm literally calm before the storm and\nAnd ah so he was he was broadcasting essentially a through periscope\nAh for periods of time thirty to forty minutes or even shorter times but then as you mentioned are going live later and this is something that again it is too I think display the power of a storm for many of us\nThat have never been through a storm and very few people relatively speaking\nHad been through this storm like this but when you're able to\nShow people how powerful this is what it does and he's just going to be there by the way he anticipated being there for up to a week or longer because he knows that's going to be next to impossible to get out of the parking garage because of the you know the damage left behind\nAnd that's what you hope to do you hope to show people\nThat this damage and how powerful\nThis storm is now hurricane Michael becomes tropical ... Michael or in the last hour or so but still when you look on the radar a Tom this thing right now Michael\nEveryone in the state of Georgia right now is feeling some effect of Michael as it's centered over a Georgia and moving toward the Carolinas\nWhat do we expect them next and the next twenty four to forty eight hours and be on\nWell initially what we're going to expect in his life [noise] you know there there still is a life threatening storm surge going on um to begin with a Panama City in along the coast there they still are anywhere from three to five feet a inundation going on right\nAnd so we haven't had a a little water to recede but we're also going to have tremendously heavy rainfall from Michael [noise] and that's going to be life threatening flash flooding and it's going to go across not just Georgia the Carolinas and they don't need any more water they're still saturated\nAnd there are places that are going to become impassable\nIt would not necessarily be out of the question\nTo to find some of the major roads Ninety five can I say Ninety five and I'm a ... we're going to need to be aware of this is ... if if if you're if if you're working and your job is to drive somewhere bottom line is you're going to need to be alert to this [noise]\nUh the wins a high profile vehicles we're twelve hours from now still going to be looking now we've got a a Seventy mile an hour wind and within the next half hour they're going to update that\nWith a with an advisory they were given one hour advisories this was the last advisory at twelve o'clock eastern time there will be moving on to uh just regular a three hour advisories\nAnd um and so it's going to accelerate and speed as it becomes a little more entrenched in the mid level jet stream and so that'll Pickett's speed up the I'm guessing a\nProbably not by the time or off the air but twenty three miles an hour for which the into the northeast and when they're still gonna be forty miles an hour\nForty to forty five miles an hour [noise] and so I'm now\nAbove the surface\nWhere we don't have the friction of the earth five thousand feet\nWhen it's been already clocked I'm using Doppler radar [noise]\nAt that level it eighty to eighty five miles an hour and so where there's a heavy cluster of thunderstorms in there is one currently caught crossing over highway six team which goes into making from savannah [noise] um there's heavy rain there and\nThat thunder storm translates those higher wins to this\nIt's to the surface and so in those storms that they could seeing us two eighty miles or maybe even eighty five mile an hour gusts even though we're looking at it a sustained spate of Seventy miles an hour so we're going to drop about in half\nAs we go over the next twenty four hours to around forty to forty five of the speed of wins above the surface [noise]\nAnd and so right now as I said we're Seventy will be down to about forty five will still be in the tropical storm range and I believe that it will exit the United states or as we get up to friday morning out into the Atlantic\nAs a as a tropical storm\nAbout we're\nNot it's not it's not going to become a remnant it's not going to be just a cluster of storms that are moving their way off in a and a general direction John trout and great meteorologist or admire him a lot\nIndicated Ninety five court or and that's exactly what it's going to be following the court or although it will be\nOn the west side of that court door and we've already learned that the west side of that court or has some some some roots that are between Colombia and Ninety five and moving its way up toward Charlotte in Rockingham and so forth that are\nThat have their own issues when it comes to a flooding and that includes going across Lumberton\nAnd Fayetteville\nAnd both of those areas um south of Raleigh which I think it'll scoot right past Raleigh\nThose areas are are we're gonna have to be watching them as we go into today tonight and tomorrow to see if we have more catastrophic flooding ... we can probably we can probably saved for the next time we talk about turning around and don't drown\nRight right exactly and you have to do you have to proceed with with caution and don't think you can get through it as you mentioned yesterday you don't know if that road has been washed away under the surface of that water\nYou it's impossible to tell that so it is always best to turn around and certainly we're going to keep people posted throughout the morning as meteorologists Tom hale and later John ...

helping you run more efficiently as ... number one goal or aids now tropical storm Michael\nWe'll talk or later this hour with a meteorologist John trout and also coming up on the bottom of the hours some interesting poll numbers that are up in New York Times doing their goals with Oceana college are you ready for some of these yeah what are you guys go okay we got we got a minute we've got a little over ... yes okay a\nTexas Senate okay from New York Times ... fifty two percent ... forty three\nWow ... that I think that's the widest margins so far of a new poll I if I if I remember correctly Tennessee Blackburn fifty five percent\nFor for Dean Heller in recent days this is why we talk about pre Kavanaugh posts Kavanaugh but especially the hearing\nAnd then you would look the hearing that entire week of discussion and and craziness and then the vote this last Saturday as you mentioned that's really the the period you want to look at and of course after that\nWhat changed if anything change the minds of a the voters and which voters which group the Democrats as you mentioned not you can't find one that's getting a real bump but there are a couple of Republicans that seem to be getting something from it is it enough to where\nIs it long lasting will stay there until election day well keep in mind a couple of things first of all\nA within a couple of weeks are going to start seeing early voting\nAnd those that are motivated will have a day when you see early voting numbers\nAre that are up that means people are really motivated and very anxious chomping at the bit to get out and and vote\nNow and the the the New York times poll I guess we're still continuing their it's called allied pole or the one in Texas right so they they start doing it again tomorrow but as of right now and that's the woman had Ted Cruz up by nine now you've seen cruise up consistently\nUh you know in their ... I look I I still believe Texas has different animal and probably wouldn't be the same\nAs as other states I I Believe that that uh if curves wins if cruise wins by you know double figures yeah I think he would have always won by double figures irrespective of the cabin our race yeah I I just think Texas is a different animal than than other states are in\nThe primary would have won twenty sixteen he won the state um do you look at a also now look there was a period a where especially right around the\nConvention time [noise] plenty of people in the Republican Party didn't like Ted Cruz remember the uh there was a guy who voted right and and and the word from Capitol Hill I mean he was being demonized by fellow Republicans are at one point\nSo this is someone attacked cruises someone who gets the benefit I think maybe\nA to a greater degree as than than others\nOf the Republicans coming together after the capital thing when there's a jelly within the party than someone like Ted Cruz who's been criticized by his own party\nYou know the then he's going to get he's going to get that bump a little bit more or the benefit of that a little bit more uh than than others might\nSo I I ... it'll be interesting I think to to really watch this next three weeks three and a half\nWe ... and ... house races we can tell because there's that you just look at it in the polling or they don't do a lot of polls for a lot of these house races and so you really don't have an indication now I'm sure inside their campaign they do\nThey're doing the inside the inside polling but you you know that's one of the complaints you and I were having to learn by our Mitchell meeting their little while ago saying ... really can't tell because the no polls in three weeks while they are no ... in two weeks you look\nAt the toss ups but number of a district right now that are that are classified as to\nSo if I had just toss ups are categorized as toss ups\nThirty two according to our sleepy\nAnd they're not doing they don't do polls on the house seats as often as they do for the Senate seats and I have to wonder what has changed after the Capitol hearing and confirmation vote\nAnd I have to wonder again in those districts keep in mind a number of those districts or the race is is on\nTo fill the seat that someone has is leaving a Republican stepping out\nAh what does that mean is the makeup of that district changing and we look at Texas thirty two uh that is a ... a Pete Sessions or the the demographics in in his district are changing\nYou know um that's that's something that will change of politics\nAnd it's much of that district is uh I think in fact I think all over this Dallas County in Dallas County has gone balloon and well gosh going back to a Obama and two thousand eight so for a decade\nOr Hillary won in fact that district\nOr buy a point and a half and I believe it was\nA so we'll see what you know what that means for Pete Sessions as see right now is only a while and it was a poll in late September by one point\nBut he's been you know he's been somebody who has been a strong contender and years ago you would think well that's not going to change it does change in those districts when the demographics change\nI I'm you know one of the things and and again you look for any type of barometer out there to see if you know the whole cabinet thing\nHad you know well what kind of it's going to have an impact it's what kind of an impact is going to have and and uh I look at Montana for example in Jon Tester and I I guess Charlie Cook came out the other day and and uh also ... has now said it's a toss up our see peace says it's a toss up\nTester's been up uh in July was up by three in early September he was up by two by late September he was up by four but that was latest poll ended nine twenty to write a at a up over Matt Rosendale the Republican challenger what happens in\nYou know that state as we get closer or a Jon Tester has never been over fifty percent in any of the the polling ah a he is he is just over\nThe margin of error you know just slightly over in in his in his um\n[noise] a ... for example he was a plus for and that was the margin of three point seven margin of error and he was up by three that was a margin of two so he's over but now it's a Senate race it listed as a toss up\nAnd the question is in a in a place like Montana\n\nWhere conservative politics still wins in the majority of Montana mhm\nAfter everything that we have seen and and not just cabinet but everything that's coming out now you know the Hillary videos getting played everywhere they you know I had but we played on yesterday show the comments\nI'm\nOf the former attorney general mhm are being played\nYou know a well if they go low will ... come from Eric Holder mhm\nThey're being played or the you know CBS News story I mean even the mainstream media thinking up that Democrats have said they're not going to take the high road incivility now is there a politics of choice by the way had Sarah Palin said if they go low will kick him oh it would be the number one story\nAnd the mainstream made right so you you see the strategy that they have which is not a strategy of expanding their base because it's not\nClaiming you're going to be you know uncivil claiming that\n... claiming as we said during the whole cabinet thing 'cause this is what to me that was the big message it came out of it the ... the criticism that Democrats put on Republicans or anybody else that didn't agree with them is if you if you believe in the mindset of due process\nAnd a presumption of innocence urine and ... ... you weren't able or a rape is that is what you do mhm\nThat's the message that they set out I\n... if that's a great selling point in America today than we certainly are doomed yep if that if you believe that gives you an advantage and it does in an election then you're right we're heading\nAnd then you are right we're heading down the wrong path that we are doomed as we've always doing away with civility wins in America it will prove may right eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nEnjoy football your goals eight

Tom hale in case you're just tuning in right now are waking up a hurricane Michael is now a tropical storm a latest update was so about an hour and a half ago from the national Hurricane Center and a sixty mile an hour winds tropical storm now ... what our sustained winds and heading toward South Carolina\nYeah we'll hear from Tom uh his take on on uh the ... this historic storm as it came ashore but also what to expect in the coming days ah is ah the people of Georgia right now are feeling the wrath of\nTropical storm Michael all the entire state basically covered by that storm massive massive footprint\nAlso coming up and say about to apparently the or the FBI getting that man who was going to build a bomb for election day ... and detonated in Washington it looks like they went to his house and found two hundred pounds you know found some kind of explosive device or was like two hundred pounds\nYou know uh you you go back to a day or two and listen to a Senator Rand Paul\nTalking about where the left is going and of course after his attack he knows all too well or what people will do when they're politically motivated but talks about the greater potential love and and he said is concerned that there will be an a sat there might be an assassination or in another attempted assassination\nOr we go back to the um uh the the the ball field is shooting of ... and how that was\nAnd how that was as we pointed out yesterday a multiple assassination attempt that shooter was out to get as many members of Congress as he could on that day so it's a real threat here is your national forecast ... by video roadblock\nWe will see the devastating effects of what hurricane Michael brought to when the sun comes up today but the system is still moving throughout the forecast area of southwest Georgia\nMost of South Carolina and below country of North Carolina today as well as portions of the tide water and Delmarva Peninsula will experience rain over the next twenty four hours or so only about two to four inches of rain however as the system continues to move in London lose that Gulf moisture source\nAnd reaches Ireland yeah yeah yeah [laughter] so [laughter]\nYeah well ah to our friends in Europe or you know um you can have\nA whiz we hope you does does that does that are on the water is warm enough that far north in the Atlantic to keep it going then\nYes okay yeah while I did\nI just assume by the time we got to walk Tobar and probably be cool down so I was surprised to hear that but the outer still warming up and\nAnd and that's why we're having these storms or you know the the normal hurricane season ends at the beginning of November right and so at this point there's a reason to that extent this is the fourth\nMajor hurricane that we've had in the month of October period and so yeah that's and that's just simply a and it was unusual to have a major hurricane to begin with in October [noise] when you consider that there's been four of them total\nAnd and so and for the last nine something that just sticks in my mind was and I can't remember which one of you said it well is it going to kind of lose some power as it comes into shore and\nAnd I and my immediate reaction was no no [laughter]\nYeah yeah right yeah and you were right 'cause I\nI'd asked that question which brings into another question that is just to just personal interest to me\nAnd and that is when you get it from a tornado or tornadoes hurricanes get their energy from the warm water right yes All right so do does that mean that a hurricane like this doesn't then does it as a result\nBut it's taking the energy from the water just the water actually cool down\nA yeah actually it does because what it does this causes a boiling a which by the way is a very bad thing if you like oysters\n[laughter] just like [laughter] might not be\nGood or Easter season right\nI'd hate or the came in and Nineteen eighty five was the last storm that hit this area of Florida and and and cake came in hold onto your hat\nAt Mexico beach while the same place style and for that entire year and I and I'm not sure it might have been longer than that it devastated the oyster crop of the Appalachian bay um you know ... right area\nWhile while in terms of the life of Michael you know from the time that it was officially a tropical storm too you know looking at the forecast as you mentioned a back out over water and the Atlantic\nOr is this going to be one of the longest living storms in terms of the the life the span of time with Michael is active\nUm no I don't think so you've you've stumped me on that one because we've got some that don't even make it here but for some reason they just spin around in the mid Atlantic right we're in the western Atlantic and so I've never I've never looked into that yeah\nYeah um it it just seems that a ... and you mentioned this earlier talking about you know we always often we'll talk about a storm the remnants of the remnants of and as you mentioned\nWe this we're not going to get to that point in terms of it being overland here we're not going to talk about the remnants of Michael it will be still tropical storm Michael overland\nBS to Charlotte to Raleigh and Norfolk yeah and that's where I Am concerned about a lot when it goes through no fault that whole area up there the Hampton Roads area you know that area just floods [laughter]\nYeah and and so I mean we didn't talk about it a lot with Florence but it was flooding and Florence it was nothing compared to the flooding that was going on in in in central\nNorth Carolina right and so it never really picked up any news but when this goes over there I think we're going to hear a lot more about the Virginia beach no for\nAn Hampton Roads area as it probably exits somewhere right in that area and heads out into the into the ocean and you know we haven't even touched on power outages right\nA power outages there's this huge swaths of it's gonna be from power outage cabbage is from Columbia pretty much all the way up to the uh uh Virginia border to at least uh\nTo at least to pass Wilmington and and just where you

I was asking you the question kind of put you on the spot\nLast last hour but you you actually answered it on the spot very well and and were corrected generally speaking talking about the longest lasting\nA hurricane and and I found a little data their weather dot com about ah this would be a hurricane John back in Nineteen Ninety four which had a a thirty day run a this thing traveled nearly eighty two hundred miles and all out in the Pacific\nA effect of Hawaii but then kept going and but ah roughly a thirty day run but I mean if you look at and you mentioned this earlier and it it is something to remind folks that are still in the path of Michael that\nTypically and very often we see a that a storm or or hurricane starts to fall apart overland and then we we hear words like the remnants of but there are no remnants then again this is a well formed tropical storm a that is traveling ah right now headed for the Carolinas and wreaking havoc\nOn on Georgia and uh and then we'll go back out over the ocean ah we also\nWant to go or you name it extra tropical once it goes out over the ocean ... okay and and write\nIs it's it's no longer in the it's no longer a tropical storm in the tropical zones or so forth and it's going to lose power to forty miles an hour and then it'll regained power and that regain power is considered extra tropical but it's\n... you're right in in nailing it here [noise] be it may not be the thirty days storm that meanders out there and\nBecause it's making a good time but it's definitely covering a lot of terrain\nIt really is traveling in the end and speaking of traveling up for those professional drivers out there and the high profile trucks I Know that uh that uh Jon Traub mentioned this earlier it bears repeating for those truck drivers that\nAre and they know their season driver they know that those those are the those sustained wins a the ... whether it's hurricane force even tropical storm force\nCan turn one of those trucks over that can happen very easily and we're not even talking about the gusts or as you mentioned the the threat of the tornadoes there those sustained winds at forty forty five miles an hour or can wreak havoc on those high profile vehicles there along Ninety five\nAnd as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael ...\nAlong Ninety five and as you mentioned we're going to see kind of that route over the next day or so uh with with Michael it will the kind of hug I guess a Ninety five in a way a so those traveling along Ninety five need to be aware of that\nUh because that as a main quarter of course between Florida and New York well and um\nAnd then go ahead to some ... some degree they're going to have this stuff that they are back in the wins and so that the the probably my biggest concern would be three eighty five [noise] uh twenty\nUh although right now it's moving across twenty with very heavy rain in Augusta\nAnd but there are a number of those roads forty as another one going up into Raleigh Durham Seventy four that comes out of Wilmington hence to Charlotte\nEvery one of those crossroads the ...
