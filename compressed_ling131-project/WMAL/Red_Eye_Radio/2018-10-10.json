when you talk about the fact that\nWhen you're talking about going and I think both of us had made I made a fair point you made a great point but you really don't know what you're gonna get until you see somebody sitting in front of the un it's almost like a presidential spokesperson for as making the analogy view is almost like an NFL quarterback you are at an NFL quarterback\nYou have no idea how they're going to perform you'd have no idea right and all the time they get on the field unions like oh they stink I really really good and we as I mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders that that you know most presidential spokes people I don't like but if you would have told me when that and I probably made the comment I don't remember specifically making it\nBut when she came aboard I probably went [noise] no I just don't think she has it right away it was I wrong\nYou know and and and she has been very uh she doesn't even flinch anymore\nOr ... if you look at the nature of the ridiculous questions thrown at her every single day and now it's just it's more like a game\nAnd that's the way she plays it but at first it was not a game and it and it it's not an easy job it's not a job that anybody would want but she's been very good at it and you're right with few exceptions like a John Bolton you know you pretty much know where you're going to get with a John Bolton but\nOtherwise uh there are a lot of people on that list and and and we'll see but clearly again going in I think they know what they're in for\nA not only internationally and what we're dealing with at the un but of course\nA what the president expects\nA drivers for cobra electronics you should be aware that there are parts of ice Seventy five and also I tend there in the Florida Panhandle\nAt the same time is wins wrapping around the giant wind field work causing storms and um and tornados along the Carolinas and the Carolinas have got a\nPretty good chance of of multiple tornadoes associated with this and and you know anyone in this entire area of the Big Bend and the panhandle uh are are going to basically relate to\nA cake which happened to be in Nineteen eighty five [noise] um but this is going to blow paid out all the water\nTom in terms of the the the danger coming ashore because I think a lot of people may be who are looking at\nYou know the I coming ashore but I mean the where the danger and the potentially life threatening situation start what is that timeline where is that window and and what should we expect during that time line\nOkay when it comes to the timeline on what you should expect 'em by tomorrow morning it still should be on shore and it will be probably ...\nBill a category three but darn\nClose to a category for it I wouldn't be shocked if in the next ... in in a in one hour from now I may be upgraded but by Wednesday evening it should be on shore\nAnd so that would be in line with Tallahassee it would be coming across Tallahassee by Thursday evening it shouldn't be\nEntering the Carolina and cutting right across the middle of the Carolinas and so the eastern side of it will be the onshore winds and the rain and the storms so Charlotte ... and up the coast [noise] and then they don't need any more\nUh destruction or anything now wins are going to be around forty five miles an hour\nOr when it gets to the Carolinas and that's going to be Thursday morning but on Wednesday today or we're gonna have wins in Tallahassee tonight of at least eighty miles an hour [noise]\nMiles an hour and a and a probably sustained winds up to forty or fifty miles an hour going through Tallahassee [noise]\nUm we're looking at wins that are going to be up to a hundred miles an hour [noise] or when we get to a coming on shore and the storm surge as the other really bad situation [noise]\nAh from pretty much I don't want to include Panama City Panama City six to nine foot storm surge\nAnd that's in part because their shoreline faces a little more to the southwest\nAnd so when it comes in and if it comes in to the east the Windsor going to be backing so it will reduce that effect but you get past that to saint Joe which is on the er an insular they're swinging around toward Appalachia cola [noise] ah we're looking at the storm surge that\nWill run all the way around through the entire big band that doesn't include cedar key um\nOf nine to Thirteen feet while\nYeah nine to Thirteen feet um obviously once your past three feet cars float\n... yeah\nAnd and then we so we're talking about a book again in terms of that immediate threat really the greatest threat right now in those areas along the shoreline we're talking storm surge correct\nTied the storm surges is clearly from the you know there's a storm surge warning in effect from Panama City past crystal river [noise] and and so as an example um we're looking at Panama City tonight they'll start seeing wins moving their way up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd all the way through an average fifty miles an hour through Wednesday night they're going to have gosh Wednesday night uh as this storm has come ashore of a hundred miles an hour and a storm surge of eight to twelve feet or excuse me rain I'm Sorry of eight to twelve inches a foot of rain\nSo I handle it and and even on the coast flash flooding is going to be a common event\nThat range got to go somewhere and ah and once you start to inundate the water starts to rise under a storm surge [noise] um\nThen from there then you start dealing with the rain on top of that and so we saw that in New Bern a newborn uh on friday night before the storm came in and the Carolinas the winds were coming out of the southeast and blowing up\nThe Neuse River New Bern is at the end of the Neuse River and they had a water rise of ten point two feet\nAnd and we had the um we had a a lieutenant I'm dropping his name but the lieutenant of the police department there the following day talking about the uh friday night rescues which were over three hundred and fifty boat rescues [noise]\nUm that night about well\nI'm ... again uh the\nYou know I there's this should go without saying but but certainly we want to repeat it as often as possible the people that are in the path of this storm need the heat all of the directors and warnings given by local officials do not hesitate\nA that this is this is going to be a life threatening storm it is already a life threatening storm and it is right now you have time to get out of the way of the storm\nA Tom ... in terms of ah the the rainfall you mentioned a that we're going to see in some places maybe to twelve inches of rain\nUm the flooding potential though won't necessarily be like it was because of Florence because of the storm is moving faster is that correct\nYeah to some degree that's correct but still I expect to many areas to pick up anywhere from eight to twelve inches as we move inland through Tallahassee\nAnd then from there when we move across the border into Georgia [noise] we're still going to be looking at five inches of rain or more in many areas and I can pull up some maps and break that out um next time we talk buttery the fact of the matter is that it only takes\nYou know it doesn't take a lot of water if the ground saturated for run off to start flash flooding right\nAnd we all know the usual places where flash flooding takes place\nWell the difference here is that this storm liked the Carolinas along the coast are going to cause flooding in the places that are not the usual places\nYeah sorry ... ... and when when you expected to onshore\n[noise] expect onshore between three and four o'clock okay hum this afternoon fair right All right\nAll right maybe Ronald just Tom hale you're going to be with us throughout the morning thank you Tom tom and they don't standing\nCoverage for us as he mentioned with Hurricane Florence and also uh last year with a Hurricane Irma in in Florida so uh we are we just want to

be aware that the first responders to going to be limited and being able to get to you and in in many cases especially while the storm is at its strongest in that area will not be able to get to you so you may not have power you may be in a situation\nUh that uh you will not be able to again\nI get to any kind of a ... assistance or four hours and so uh it is best to\nGet out of the way of the storm as soon as possible uh get inland go somewhere where you will be safe and where you are with others especially if you have an underlying medical condition or anything else that might to warrant a that kind of a of a need so\nUh we'll see here and a little while we're going to talk with meteorology if a John trout I get caught up on this latest update from the national Hurricane Center\nAnd so we have uh the the latest uh in the Indiana Senate brown versus a Donnelly a Donnelly not vote for a cabin off\nAnd the down when he was up by a by three at the end of August the Fox news poll nine twenty nine to ten to has Donnelly up by two well within the margin of error three point to a five percent\nOr and now they have there are three of a different candidates are in this race including the libertarian\nYeah so uh but right now it's forty three forty one or a ... you know Donnelly with the lead but uh again excuse me a yes Donnelly with the the lead the Democrat in there but then again that really you look at that that is another a dead heat that exist out there and then we go to Missouri\nAnd uh the uh latest Fox News poll nine twenty nine to tend to and that is a dead tied now that is before the actual vote took place\nAnd before colon speech and everything else so that's the kind of thing that we're looking for the polls coming out of it may be here in the next couple of days or early next week and as we get closer to see the effect that that that has had there there are a ton of these races that are\nA statistical tie with even in the statistical tie Democrats maybe up a point or two and a and so this is something that I'm sure as being very carefully watched\nAnd again when you go into and I were not pollsters you know we're not pollsters we can read them but I mean the methodology\nOf of each and every poll has different nuances in it it all depends on you know what the sample is do they interview more Democrats than actually are in a you know that normally vote in a particular race or not or did they over sample Republicans\nFight and and so you look at it but overall when you look at at the the generalized polls are a ton of the Senate races that are extremely close and so\nA lot of eyes are watching to see okay what's the excitement level going to be the voter excitement level\nOut of the cabinet and hearing which I Do believe will have an impact sure\nYeah and so there's a ... right now looking at some of the the the Senate races on a you\nYou look at the the race with Rick Scott it's interesting dynamic and and and frankly hurricane\nMichael [noise] uh and how it's handled will be part of that discussion and campaigning\nOn both sides uh uh you know for the next few weeks um it it may seem like an unfortunate situation to many but that's that's how politics runs in the ... the United states and it may it can make or break a candidate depending on how it's handled and while\nYou know a senator or isn't going to have\nA control if he were to become a senator or over what's going on in that state necessarily\nI'm ... like a governor ... during an emergency situation\nHow he handles it will be closely watched over the next few days because it's going to be it's going to be a very politically sensitive situation I'm sure a many from his camp will tell you what were not focused on that right now nor should they be\nBut people outside that a camp are focused on that and we'll\nBe alert the reality is that if\nFlorence was handled properly by the Trump Administration Democrats would be using it yes and and you didn't end up being that is used in political races yes and and as you and I talked about from the very beginning and I watched a lot more\nOf the of of Florence are coming in that I have so far of of this particular race but\nWhen you watch on the weather channel you came across with the great opinion of the federal government and\nHow they were how they were handling the s it'll be interesting to see at the same thing happens you know here because it will be used yes no doubt eight six six Ninety ...\nTips from Jean J.

Senator Tom cotton said that he believes Schumer's people leaked before letter\nReally yeah he was on with a huge huge show yeah instead I Believe like Schumer political operation was behind this from the very beginning Mm\n[noise] well I mean if because that would it wouldn't be a totally unexpected right it doesn't seem out of the realm of possibility\nRealm of possibilities because if you're Feinstein you you don't take it's a chairman Grassley you chicken to sugar party letter right and and have him deal with it right for video robot here's your forecasts\nData from air force reserve and know a hurricane hunter aircraft indicate that the maximum sustained wins have increased to near one hundred thirty miles an hour with higher ... possible as Michael becomes a category for hurricane Michael\nExtremely dangerous life threatening storm surge hurricane force winds\nAnd heavy rainfall expected as well as the potential for tornadoes to spawn from the result of this system will get nine to Thirteen feet of water inundation along the coastline and as much as twelve inches of rainfall from the system for areas just inland from where we expect Michael\nA and at that point\nYou have to say to yourself well if you haven't been around for Kate you know what other things have come by well ah there's been very few October storms to begin with I'm\nThis storm is an October storm ... he was an October storm and there was a a field you but as Celia was a major all these are major storms but a failure was offshore and so it didn't have that kind of a an effect on Florida\nThan so right now if you're listening or if you have family and friends along that area you need to understand that that on Wednesday evening one hundred mile an hour gusts are going to be common\nAnd that's after it's come onshore\nUm tomorrow evening because we're expecting a still a landfall sometime around three to four o'clock and that means that it'll speed up a little bit before\nAnd so it'll speed up a little bit before it comes to shore right now it's gone gone to the north of twelve so\nAnd of course uh you know it's been pointed out time and time again not just the wins in ... and the destruction of property and and present danger to humans but but really the flooding in the storm surge here the water that comes along with a storm like this\nUh being a potentially life threatening in fact that his life threatening and is often deadly um\nAnd and that is something to be aware of it is not just the strength of the storm in terms of wins but also the water that it's going to deliver a both and storm surge and rainfall\nWell yeah you know remember the the ... in in the past it used to be lightning lightning was like the number one whether killer and you know wide lightning isn't the number one whether killer ... because we convinced everybody to go out and the lightning\nRight [laughter] okay yeah indoors is lightning right but you know we've done a really lousy job at convincing people to use common sense when they're on the road and they're driving\nAnd and we had over thirty people in the Carolinas drowned because\nThey decided they were going to be tougher and they knew what they were doing better than the people who are telling them to stay off the road right now and and\nAnd and so yeah a storm surge is usually felt along the coast and let's say maybe five to ten miles inland wherever there's a waterway that the water from the Gulf of Mexico can move its way and [noise]\nAnd so whether you're an Appalachian cola or you are in Panama City or you're swinging around uh uh toward the coastline just south of Perry and the big band that you're looking at a a storm surge that's going to be easily\nNine feet couldn't be less right can be up to nine feet or even Thirteen actually the weather service has got a plot at nine to Thirteen feet in that area\nFor those of us who have never witnessed that first and uh just described the dynamics of a storm surge especially one with the potential of a nine to twelve feet or more as you mention\nThat because you know we've seen in a recent video from the nominee in Indonesia and we know so we can see that kind of force in terms of a storm surge I mean one of the dynamics of that what\nI describe that to us what takes place during the storm\nYeah because I'm here I'm looking here like it at Panama City beach for example that's you know uh you're right there I mean there's no there's no barrier it's not one of the bays it's right there what is what is the effect how far I mean that goes in a pretty long way doesn't it\nOh yeah yeah when you go into the west bank or the East Bay um\nAll the way up through um what they called dear point lake which is his Israeli an extension the northern extension of the north bay [noise] ah or the grand lagoon this entire area from the\nFrom the lower ... which is which is basically where the beach is uh the the bridge that goes over to the over to the beach I'm\nAn inland all of that water rises\nUniformly pretty much it's kind of like turning the water on it's not like what you're seeing a smelling like salami it's turning the water on and watching your bathtub so and except in this particular case as the storm gets closer in the last uh\nHour and a half to two hours or so\nThe bath tub still banned so in the Carolinas the the I I don't know if it was the record but it started close to it ... North Carolina have picked up a storm surge of it was at least ten feet I'm there may have been a higher storm surge\nA further around the point um that that sticks out there if the Carolinas [noise] um but\nThis water just keeps rising and and as it starts to rise three feet six feet and so forth you need to be able to get to a place that's higher than the storm surge that's a really simple as it gets [noise] and this water is moving\nAnd and so the water has motion it can erode stuff [noise]\nUm when I say it's moving it it's it's normal current and it's moving because it's also got winds blowing it at a good speed and so you've got a certain amount of ah\nIt's not going to be moving as fast as the wind because the surface tension the water's going to slow that body down but it's still moving so [noise] I ... the place that I recall and I drove through this area a couple of times [noise] um because\nIt's just a beautiful ride in your ... you know if you've done this for German for each point\nIn the Appalachian coal a cute little towns especially when you're coming across the bridge and they're looking at Appalachian ... down to the south and East Bay on the other side [noise] um\nAny notices you're looking off along the water all these nice homes but they're on stilts and they're they're all stilted easily at about ten feet [noise] um well Thirteen feet would still inundate those homes\nYeah that's that's that you know that that puts it in perspective for anyone who's gone to a beach and seen these houses in\nFact we stayed in one uh in in in Texas and the and the guy was scenario over the summer and we've done that many times but if you've ever been to these are areas and you've seen these houses on these stilts uh you're right those the typically there are about ten feet high\nBut add another three feet to that potentially and that means even on still you're going to see destruction and flooding of those homes and that is very very powerful and and sobering frankly\nYou've heard the terms high profile vehicles right okay well this is a house that's a high profile house and once you get past the stilts now you've got three feet of water going into a more solid structured and so that's going to be a lot easier to topple and destroy yeah\nSure and wildlife yeah great point of the higher center of gravity yes I Am that situation which becomes a very destructive very easily um ... and so again a the timeline here we're looking for the eye to come ashore sometime in the afternoon\nYes and and and right now it depends if it if it goes the speed that is going right now and makes a nice even turn and doesn't increase speed when it makes the turn a little bit to the north northeast [noise] uh it wouldn't get there 'til six thirty eastern time [noise]\nUm but if it picks up some speed or even a couple of miles an hour goes from twelve to fourteen and so forth\nOr we could anticipate the St coming in a little bit earlier than that around four o'clock and that's kind of what everybody's betting on right now\nThey're getting rain right now ... has just had the light rain and in fact all of this is a very light rain tropical rain starts off this little find drops and then increases from there [noise] um\nAnd there's a couple of little thunder storms that are running anywhere from Appalachian coal up to Pensacola Beach to listen to the eye opener hey notice it's raining Israel it's coming your way\nRight how far inland can we can we expect those hurricane force winds anything from Seventy five miles an hour and above a two to sustain a how far inland in and how long do you expect that to be the case\nAll right let's assume that it it comes to shore and we'll just simply call it where it is right now for ... forty five miles inland\n... is what you would be looking at\nAnd forty five miles inland would make those wins go to Panama City at least and possibly a little further out and it would take those winds back over to\nProbably not to Perry but at least to St Mark's ... National Wildlife refuge area which is to the chest south or just slightly south east to Tallahassee but\nNow remember this this right now the location is a hundred and eighty miles to the south south west to\nPanama City or a hundred and Seventy miles okay southwest of Appalachian coal it hurt a tropical storm force winds thirty nine miles an hour and more are extending out right now as we speak a hundred and Seventy five miles are so\nSo they're starting to feel the beginning of those thirty nine mile an hour winds at the extremities Appalachia cola and and possibly you know and then an hour or two by morning for sure when the sun comes up\nCom the red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\n... the ... family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fund cats scale and ... products we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the truckers America's most red trucking news [noise]\nNow every week and watch me and my co host Jessica Rose has been the only weekly news show greater just\nJoined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with an awesome regularly profile\nIn front of the dot com is the one friend not you're not going to want to have them be he traveled down the highway so tune in every week and watch the news channel by going to the record dot com [noise]\n\n... rich W a male Washington\nHer workplace thing Haley I've only at Francis hurricane Michael has intensified to a category ... storm forecasters say the system is expected to produce life threatening storm surge of up to Thirteen feet but it makes landfall later today they were all just ...\nAlready seeing the outer bands of Michael push the shore right now so strong thunderstorms reported around Panama City will begin to see some of those tropical storm force winds with this as well and that of course the way in for nine eventually if I knew and eventually for three PM then we talk about hurricane force winds in that category for force where\nThey're coming ashore with one hundred thirty miles per hour sustained gusts as much as a hundred and fifty five miles per\nHour Turkish newspapers published the names and photographs of Fifteen Saudi nationals what led you to play around and is stumble on board to private jets today journalist demarco show he went missing\nTurkish officials say the reporter and government critic was killed inside his country's consulate in Istanbul after he visited the mission to obtain a document record the memory of Turkish fiance Saudi Arabia has denied the allegations\nOn Tuesday you on a bachelor Nikki Haley unexpectedly you said it's time to move on what customs teeny tell us\nWhat was going to be plenty of speculation about one of the news came out now even is Nikki Haley is willing to ride out the ear at her un post she would be feeling pressure for national security adviser John Bolton who is decidedly anti United Nations for Haley the international fights may have taken a toll I Want\nA blessing to lengthen the land with fire\nEveryday Americans\nIncluding the expected departure of attorney general Jeff Sessions and other cabinet members Mr Trump now has a new job opening\nWe have a number of people that would very much like to do it it's a great position above ... the white\nHouse here is is adding a restructuring expert towards board suggesting that the retailer maybe preparing to take drastic actions\nIncluding filing for bankruptcy this week\nDoes your basement or crawl space of a damp must be smell will watch out that's a sign of too much moisture and not enough ventilation\nAnd that could mean increased mold growth and build up of harmful toxins gases don't bother with a D humidifier if just circulates the same on health a year now there's a better way to remove these dangers in odors it's with the computerized wave ventilation unit that reduces moisture and expelled pollutants\nWith wave units there are new buckets of water or filters and they cost only pennies a day to run wave can transform your home into a drier healthier environment satisfaction guaranteed ask about our indoor air package\nThat includes the wave ventilation unit plus a six stage portable air purifier dealer opportunities available for more information visit dry house now dot com that's dry house now dot com or coal eight eight eight nine seven nine wave that eight eight eight nine seven nine W.

is a spring right now the hurricane for category for storms which means winds up over one hundred and thirty miles an hour\nThis storm has weakened and in fact it's still strengthening I mean it was the real deal is not a drill a this is going to come in hard it's going to come and powerful and you do not want to be on the immediate coastline and building\nA that's a storm chaser Mike these in Panama City and that report their ... to a ... a Westwood One the news\nYou know you watch this storm and and and look at how the storm is strengthen over well just over the last twenty four hours really um but from the weekend where are some were predicting a category somewhere between a category one possibly a two and then by Monday morning\nA it with the with that report early Monday started to change and they were saying possibly a three now officially a category for hurricane Michael is as you mentioned Gary and everything that comes with it I mean if you look at the the the winds\nUh that will be a danger to two people and take out power lines no doubt\nBut the storm surge anywhere between nine and twelve feet or hire a the water from this storm not just from the storm surge but the rainfall that will come\nIt is going to be dangerous it is going to be life threatening and there is again no other way to say it but get out of the weight of this storm if you're in this area\nUh I Do everything you can to get out of the way the storm as it continues to move inland it will dump more rain and we also have to keep in mind that it will spawn tornadoes coming up here to about thirty minutes we'll get back with meteorologist Tom hale\nWho's been without a been with us through uh the morning and and uh and and also did some outstanding coverage on red eye radio for\nHurricane Florence and Hurricane Irma as well uh so we want to get back with him and find out the latest in and again go over some of the the threats to bury real threats of the storm and the timeline as well um most expecting the eye of hurricane Michael to hit\nThe coastline ... come ashore somewhere between three and six PM on a Wednesday afternoon very important to understand that the\nAnd Devin Nunes has brought it up like that I I don't know why the president doesn't make sense and then he stopped talking about right\nBecause nobody is talking about it in Washington none of the politicians Adam Schiff isn't talking about it nobody is talking about the fact that\nThey did the reduction and then gave it to the inspector general heat classified ad and then said oh we see something here that the inspector general who investigates corruption mhm we give it to him\nTo review it because there's only ... whether it was done for this reason or not there's only one thing that can really come of it and that is an investigation by the inspector general\nTo look over it and write a report on it\nYou would think somebody would ask the president Mr President what did the administration see in the unprotected material to give it to the inspector general who's only job is to go after corruption illegal wrongdoing and possible crimes\nBecause politically the effect of it is what it is what we said I mean 'cause I could see the scenario although we haven't been told is because nobody's talking about it or speculating about it except us\nWe speculate on CNN spends tons of time speculating on hold for what the definition of a mob exactly\nWell this is something real because we know the role of the inspector general's office rain do we also know a Michael Horowitz in

was handed over to Horowitz Horowitz has access to the FBI\nAll day long anything he wants something the White House would really have to beat down the doors to get and I know that's ridiculous

J. H. G. channel seven down there is going to be going wall to wall coverage [noise]\nUh and uh and\nThey are twenty feet I called and talked to him just a minute ago uh therefore their team of four meteorologist or are in their weather center and uh they're getting ready to start their wall to wall coverage and they are twenty feet above sea level now\nThey're optimistic that they won't see a storm surge um that will get up to the station right\nAnd they're also optimistic that the generators are contend the ... power generator or work on the station is fortified sufficient enough to handle this and we won't know that until a later this afternoon right um but obviously I tomorrow we talk um maybe we'll see if we can get a phone call into them\nAnd a half minutes after it has passed by right but I think our prayers need to be with all the people\nWho are up and down that coastline that are there because they realize that\nEven though the majority of people have evacuated out of a given area that there are still some people behind and while they're not going to be able to go out and do anything once the winds up over forty miles an hour and they become tropical storm wins [noise] um\nBut that being said even though they're not going to be able to do anything when it's over with they're going to be in there in force I Know are surrounding a Panama City\nThey've got ... I think six hundred staged power company people were going to swarm in there the governor of Florida has called out I think it's fourteen hundred a National Guards uh guardsmen or guards folks a band or the same is true\n'em up and down the up and down the coast three states of of basically a declared a you know a disaster urgency\nRight let let me let me just ask you this because you did or you had predicted a before the last ah advisory that showed it went to a category of for you predicted that it would go up a couple of ... of a of of more miles per hour from a hundred and twenty five hundred and thirty and you hit it right\nDo you expect to get any stronger or do seed weakening as it gets closer to shore\nNo I don't see a weakening as gets closer to shore in this particular case um the uh the water hasn't been touched so we're looking at eighty five degree average water temperature [noise]\nUm the other thing that's going on is that\nUnlike a lot of these storms where we've got a cold front that might come in from the continental United States bringing in a little bit drier air there is a cold front out there but it's it's moving through the Dallas area right now it's it's nowhere near\nThis and so uh in in terms of what we know in the United states and and then the mid west and so forth we call it the warm sector that's the area head of the cold front\nThat warm sector is a couple of hundred miles long and they're in the heart of that warm sector they have all the fuel all the moisture and in the heat and heat in the water that's necessary so it won't they won't die down\nOr what ever it gains it will carry to shore and then once it hits the friction of the shore and then it will start to\nDegenerate a little bit so Tallahassee could be seeing routine\nI'm eighty two maybe a little more than that ... mile an hour gusts with sustained winds of fifty miles an hour while Appalachian coal a and Panama City beach will have one hundred plus mile an hour winds as it's coming ashore [noise]\nUh this afternoon and and and they'll have periods where those guys drop off to Seventy five miles an hour\nAs so yeah this is this is a fascinating point um you may not realize that savannah you know is way out on the on the coast here or north Brunswick in ... in Georgia coming out of Atlanta on sixteen [noise] uh savannah\nBecause of the wind field is going to have wins that are being ... up to twenty five miles an hour with some isolated Gus tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia toast up through the south Carolina\nThe U.S tomorrow night up to fifty miles an hour\nAnd the entire coast from the Georgia coast up through the south Carolina and North Carolina coast [noise] um\nAll of that area um potentially as far up as Morehead City I'm going to feel the force of this storm on Thursday as it moves its way out of\nOut of a Florida and crosses Georgia across Valdosta\nAnd probably somewhere between savannah and I guess to a south of making and eventually comes up across Florence\nOutta ya were looking at I'm looking at the map right here and a tropical storm warnings for all the Georgia coast and looks like about three quarters of the south Carolina coast and the rest of it as a tropical storm watch as you get a by South Carolina all the way through North Carolina almost all the way up to Virginia\nExactly exactly and I didn't even mentioned Virginia but yeah it goes that far north and uh and so we can expect forty plus mile an hour forty five mile an hour winds all the way up that entire stretch on shore wins because this is a this would be a a nor'easter that\nThe Windsor gonna bring onshore flow\nAnd it's still relatively warm along there and whatever rain has dropped and rainfall figures for that particular area or are still pretty significant and I'm\nI'm we're looking at the Florida Panhandle 'em and mid Atlantic and all the way up to New England one to three inches of rain and as for the Carolinas southern Virginia and Georgia three to six inches of rain with isolated amounts of aid and trains\nWhile while uh and and\nThat causes life threatening flash flooding yes\nYes and as people often do not heed the warnings or ignore\nHigh water areas and believe that they can get through those areas that's where it becomes deadly\nYeah let me give you another one of those little analogy is like the bath tub analogy I gave earlier um do you go to the grocery store and there's a gallon of water and you pick it up and you go oh this is kind of heavy but it's cool [noise] well that gallon of water weighs about seven pounds ...\nOK Now let's take a thousand gallons of water per minute rolling over a road\nWhich is not an unreasonable right amount of water going across something even if we brought that down and have\nWe're we're still looking at you know thousands of pounds two three four thousand pounds it will be as if a\nA ... ton pickup truck we're at Rhodes level pounding on the road back and forth just kind of bulldozing it and so forth how do you know that there's a road under their\nYeah great point great point what often there are six\nThe salt water seeks his own level so it's going to look nice and flat and smoothing all across it it's probably not going to be you know perfectly clear so you are not going to be able to see what's under it\nAnd and so just imagine all those containers of why gallons of water on a giant entire I all of the grocery store rolling across continuously every minute across the road what are the odds that it's going to tear up that road and you think you're just being tired enough to make it through\nRight and and the fact that it doesn't uh it relatively speaking of doesn't take a high water or in order to move a vehicle I mean it did has that forces you raised six inches ...\nYou know you're talking about uh you know again all these all these threats that people cannot assess
