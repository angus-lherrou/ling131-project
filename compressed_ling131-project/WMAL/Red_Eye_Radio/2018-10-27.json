day I mean I saw\nYou know that uh okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles stating well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election yeah uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just be I mean everything the pollsters may ... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump a pretty good especially in a presidential election but they missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety or where they weren't even close\nThe summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cobra electronics\nThat said ten point lead over the

ohio\nYou know from you you can go just a ... from where I live to just uh you know several miles north\nAnd the tax rate varies greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences the loud I'm black my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a yeah my my tax\nRate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it um but even aside from that if you've got a\nA home that's worth more than ... your your taxes are higher and lower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember ... ... ... the the the\nThat will be at that edge a\nAren't the we're not talking the super rich were I thought about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class right\nAnd they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse right now there's still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message my Republican congressman and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to Ben paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole cabinet thing\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this was the one thing that may bud perch that is they're coming on bluntly and saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them are coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax credit we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes and which could hurt that we've also talked about the care of that\nRight and they were in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears along expected declined is here now the economy overall\nMay not be and and and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a ... to the caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us but the steel in an automobile the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't the China thing\nRight it's the United states and Europe and and and\nMexico that they're still in effect and it's killing them it's raising their price as we said\nWhen the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody is using the new name by the way [laughter] All right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed\nThe the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's been unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that he has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWas a story last week about Ford grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars and they believe the terrorists are going to ... that are hurting them remember every supplier at every small business that deals with Ford in the United states knows that that's coming\nOr or or or feeling it already and every dealership and every deals that members of seal terrorists really been affected that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were a forty percent by the time we got to June of this year so\nThat's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were a forty percent by the time we got to June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in price\nBecause of steel costs and now because the terror of cost and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and then the farmers as we had mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about like your your talk if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people would manufacturing jobs that have technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump\nCountry [laughter] and you're talking about farmers that are extremely upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's a fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our present meeting you said I Wonder if that's\nWhy he went to you know even though it was wishy washy ethanol plan I Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because by the internal polls are saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now at\nIt as a couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt the farm belt ... it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you're trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry uh you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers are and and you know in this region in this area\nIn the state and I don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada or any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff war terrifying that went into place a or any of that if they have to make arrangements\nLot of time a lot of the time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said look thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar\nA handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our law says All right and we're ... we're we're ... or out of the loop of the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in right took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks were are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government\nOr during the recession or in two thousand eight to ... end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine they there were three apparently large banks that were on the brink that we're a possible high risk\nBut they didn't want to run on those banks so they put money in all of the coffers well they've made all the banks look\nRisky and that's the problem you create you muddy the waters well when you talk about trade trade deals between nations that are set up\nUm ... you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair it tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that is going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that then your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this uh election we talked a lot yesterday about how the Republicans in so many ways\nWere set up in a way that you don't see a political party in a midterm election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the ... you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad\nOf of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking\nA you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to their livelihood so we think it's very important to bring up all the issues that may be affecting this election both positive and negative for the Democrats and positive and negative for the Republicans just to give you a more realistic\nWould you prefer to read wrote king on your smartphone will

can give some credibility to it and we find the credibility of polls actually after an election anyone I'd done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many\nBecause we have spent his time especially after presidential elections looking at the polls that actually got it right\nAnd you know we but we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know because we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely off they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral vote right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is a wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use a you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right\nJust the fact that we don't know which of the polls to get it right before an election we have to wait till after so we can look at the issues that are are that are affecting at a you know another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may\nIf if it goes on for another two years and right\nAnd I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election in may if if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where uh I I call it a a\nCrump exhaustion and I've I've just twenty that weren't just popped into my head right now and and it goes back to last week when I was on vacation and I go back to ... I've often talked about there's roughly five women that I Know\nThat ... that I abused as examples these are all women that are in executive positions either own their companies are in management up or you know a high management and the company's up there in our own their own companies\nYou don't need it seems that this president at times\nThings that the only people he has to satisfy is his base in his rhetoric mhm\nHe's satisfied I Believe his base for the most part\nUh and and I think the base has has his base has expanded because of the whole cabinet thing but you're based isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere\nThey're staying with him and and the people surrounding his base are going to stay with him that it's so it's those people who are okay there's some good things some bad things where am I going where you know what do I think and then boom\nAnd and so I just thought I bring up what the the the one\nLoyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again in both probably straight ticket Republican I'm I ... I guess you know I'm not sure but it probably would vote straight ticket Republican who was just finally ... that was the limit the horse race was the limit it was because you had the when you had the when it was a slam dunk win\nAnd then you made it less civil went right\nWhy why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base\nAnd so there you go but a waste of your calls and kind of coming up your your life you know we do have a wide open eight six six Ninety red eye\nTips from Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated on customer service dispatcher serve as a sort of air traffic controller for the company's fleet\nEnsuring drivers get where they need to safely and as soon as possible there often juggling duties between multiple trucks and drivers so patients from both the driver and the dispatcher is essential for us to the operation when times get challenging like when there's bad weather or a driver gets a bad route\nThe relationship between dispatcher and driver can experience rough moments negatively affecting all parties and removing the customer from the equation as a priority to both driver and dispatcher maintaining a good working relationship with your dispatcher and communicating with him or her regularly especially when there are problems\nHelps keep all parties focused on what's most important keeping customers happy and drivers safe\nThis ship was brought to you by Jay Jay Keller and associates incorporated visit us on Jay Jay Keller dot com\nThis has been the marriage or drive a report brought to you by pilot flying J shell road jello and marriage or after market run with a bowl [noise]\nBook read are ready to do with a record ...

go to you go to the baseless lawsuit you go to the um uh ... you go to a a a cabin on and you say these are the people that are against me right and to me I like people say well what do you mean that's a well no that's a positive uh what came out ... of the news story that\nAh we said look I was a couple of months ago from here to the mid term let's stay on course with the positives the economy's number one and then the things you want to get done but then\nYou get that you get the help from the left you get the capital of thing you get the care of and thing you get all all these other things that you know and and of course uh you know I'm a Cory bookers plan\nA you get the you know Camilla Harris plan you know this is what they want to do or the or or ... or or any of that you know there are promoting this but that's not going to work we're promoting this and look what's working you can demonstrate that your ideas are working and you can point out we're there's aren't going to work and\nThat's something that is extremely rare in politics even with ah other effective presidents of the past you know you can show already a track record of getting things done that are helping the economy\nYou know and and that's it and and and by the way I I Do want to um\nClarify you know we've criticized the former President Obama speaking in Nevada ... on yesterday's show or when you know because he said don't forget who started this and I think he's right we shouldn't Donald Trump started this economy we shouldn't forget who started this all your right and if\nMr Obama or so the the the whole thing is again you you you have those positives stay on them because what is the rally\nWhat is a rally a rally\nIs a a ton of positives and this Matt this massive\nGroup of foreign people that are ready to take action you know\nThat's that's where ... if you think about it every day on social media should be that rally between now and November I mean it's not that you have to have positives you can go after Chuck Schumer right\nIt buddy because I I think it's very important to understand that in the real political world I mean you'll have the purest out there saying I'm against the negative advertising this ridiculous right of course you have to point out one ounce and you've got you've got to point out the negatives of your\nUh you know of your candidate you have to point out the negatives that\nThe government can't give you all the Iran to write that somebody is lying to you when they tell you that they can make it a beautiful like the frustration that our last caller abs all solve crime may not really that great well done but that that it then that's why I started ... if I started laughing because\n... you know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe in times you have to give blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during\nThe cabin on hearing said it's unacceptable to us and we'd been blunt that you're not an American\nThat if you ... if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for capital\nYou know they were and the Democrats are trying to we use a lot of that in every well [laughter] it's it's not accord a lot it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political court that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that a criminal court has when you testify right and and so a ... a a person's reputation\nIs at stake it was a political court and yes Americans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact\nThat they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked away\nAny pretense of carrying about Americans\nAnd our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabin I hear is we don't care we point out in a very passionate ways you can see I get passionate about this because I think it's very important to point out\nThat people say well I you know it's it's offensive if you tell somebody they're not paid for it because they believe there are a patriot well know there are some standards of why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you were\nWhy you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you if you reject\nThe second amendment if you were checked a due process under the law if you were jak the electoral college if you reject the Senate\nAnd and you wish to change all of it then you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say you right it's it's not and people's about so shocking thing that you're saying no it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America or just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well\nThat's what America is\nYes that's that's it I'm you and\nWhat they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech well no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail\nThat free speech oh\nNo no no see your free speech as bigoted your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter]\nWhat the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them and you can proudly say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm\nBecause they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country so nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have the way in the\n... move onto the next when well again I Want\nTo win for calling out a O'Rourke or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do in such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy and look what they want to do with it and back to and\nAnd the other end by the way and sometimes the name calling the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling is very effective [laughter] liar Lanny I now I made that one out of I don't know [laughter] they can use the ones I I don't want to get a ...\nWas uh what was it I don't know when you when you when you thought you said sure I forgot what\nIt was just ... yeah I bought a use somebody's got those listed somewhere all day like names ... no ... we've said this so well now it's for people in office it's running it's beautiful ... that is that line that any more [laughter]\n\nAnd as far as we know the president no longer believes that Mr Cruz's father had involved in the U.S [laughter] okay [laughter] as far as we know [laughter] but\nBut look I'm we said before I thought one of the greatest um in terms of theatrics but have a point to something solid was him sitting at that table with an empty seat\nAnd an end the name of of of policy on one when I was I didn't know who were on the other that was the best oh my gosh that's brilliant I mean that's\nSomething that works brilliant as a big word but that's something that's it's effective\nThey're not showing up they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nBecause it's real simple it's it's brilliant and its simplicity that you're showing your demonstrating that you've invited them and they're they're not showing up that's what that represented\nKeep in mind the former president didn't invite members of his own party from Capitol Hill to come in and that that's not from us\nThat's from Chris Matthews he didn't like working with Democrats he didn't like because he he believed he could do a lot of it on his own by the way that was also rich we didn't pointed out of the comments he was

go to Nancy Pelosi go to Chuck Schumer challenged the Democrats mhm make this an issue the last two weeks what do you want\nWhat's your what did you were trying what if you if\nIf the house gets control and you're able to say uh what kind of a of a funding will go to border control um what would you support give us the type of border control do support right what's the border control that\nYou support and be specific and if they just say we're for comprehensive now that's not an answer challenge them in their face what this comprehensive mean do you get get get it get it and I mean get in their face rhetorically\nGet the first thing what is the first thing the number one thing in that comprehensive plan right what does that look like the American people by and large want border control\nDo you want ... Ramos does not one word of mouth but he's not a part of the government so I don't I don't even bother with him\nI don't care what a reporter thing right for for forget about him he works for Univision go right to the Democrats and say the Democrats keep talking about this All right what would you do what you keep talking about comprehensive immigration reform\nLook the thing that this has been going on for the last ... you know really since two thousand eight remember the protest that that that happened and\nStill ten years have gone by and still the Republicans have not challenge the Democrats\nTo back him into a corner to tell America what they actually want we know what they want do because all of the activists Jorge Ramos was attempting to influence and is a major influence on the Democratic party he wants to open borders ship\nSo they want open borders let the American make them be forced them into a corner where they even have to admit it or you've taken every argument away with the American public can clearly see that they want open borders since it's brought up again\nAnd the caravan is coming towards the United states and it's the opportunity to have the discussion stop talking about everything else mhm stop talking about things that don't matter\nYou can bring this back right after Kevin ought to be the number one issue again find out where the Democrats stand on an issue Mr President where the ... where the country stands behind you in a huge majority yeah use it to your advantage\nMr President where the ... where the country stands behind you in a huge majority yeah use it to your advantage\nYep because at the end of it what you're going to see is that we need to have an open border there was this is what they want this is what they would promote\nIf they were talking honestly if they were going to be Robert rice speaking to Berkeley and I'm not on health care but on border control they would say\nNo people should be able to come and go as they please\nBecause if I'm wrong well then the left needs to call me out on it\nAnd this is the other thing I Would I Would start doing that on debate stage I Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there and and say it at every route\nThey want they're promoting people being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country as they please stay that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you\n\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left ...\n... ... and and this device I'd get to the president as Mr President people already know what you think mhm forget about what have you with you everybody's border right everybody is asking you about the reporters continual ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around this what America needs to know is not what you think on a legal immigration or American thing sign a legal immigration you need to get an answer out to Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue oh ... I mean what are we lose the house into at least ... it's still going to be an issue\nTake it to the Democrats\nThey force you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration you better come clean you've talked about and how many hundreds of times and the princes act you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since\nI'm a Kennedy McCain yeah yeah since the early ... when ... was that was that two thousand eight two thousand no no no it was before ... it was two thousand gosh too but not on that was ...\nIt was before you came on board no was while we're doing the show became Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios okay\nYeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling scam misty um yes it was because it was two thousand eight\nIt was two thousand dollars was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here okay is one of our personnel and and then then it would have been the following\nYear or maybe later that year when it after it went away that McCain had to go to the um\nUh the uh he was at the conservative a convention then and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that uh he realized that the rest of America was not on board with yeah\nUh and it fell short of a a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather together on the air and that's what I say because I ... I was out here\nI was so low I remember going you know weeks on that and uh and I was so low dose and so the ... the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about it now most of this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy said day\nMight have a better chance than it did back then oh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now\nIf you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservative so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... [laughter] and then you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote\nAs much but over Thirteen Years but this has been a huge issue [laughter] huge issue because that's really what kick started this whole thing over and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats do admit\nThis is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders and that's what they want and if they don't want it\nThen tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you pass as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right that's a fair question to ask\nYou for open borders right just bluntly asked that question\nAt\nArgue for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well know than what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform of border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise that we don't know what they want right and do it and get it on eight six six Ninety ...\n[noise] ... eight six six zero all read on the radio

I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just plays the Texas ... anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money\nAt the point is is that I Would be so paranoid all the time with six on I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank it would it would a high end there would be a bit disturbed there's there's nothing I'm\nI'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I and I have a clear it would it would be a huge hassle ... uh I like my life [laughter]\nI don't want to change mhm I and I don't care what anybody says that kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards you as your life I have a a friend\nWho uh a friend or family member who are ... at one time was working for a a multibillion um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm and my\nFamily member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time of the day we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener things we are um but but\nThe point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job you have\nA you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else\nTo know I couldn't have lost\nAnyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money and ... set up some kind of foundation [noise] you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private\nSo this ... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize but\n\nIf you've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\n... exactly the the word your life your life is going to\nKind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\nHe exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but\nThat means you got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nReceiving the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members well there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax the giver has to pay the gift\nRight well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job for great out what to do even if you're not going to give it away that's what I mean they're going to be a full time job is going to be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone well I liked his life five right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right let's let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older like well like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life\nI like my life well yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life yeah I Do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited about that mhm oh yeah no I don't know I Would love you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I miss it this is one dump off it goes through my mind but it's still a thought\nOh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion because every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other title oh we've we've ever done ... really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio some when somebody comes up until today\nA little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really got it it's almost like we come to work in a warehouse that we just have the end of the show we grab our lunch pail isn't going to ... that's what the feeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist [laughter] so the mentality sort of the same for it so I but the the the thought and and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else\nThat become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life well you've one point six billion\nAll that goes away and always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right but I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep death the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges in problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going\nTo get all this money death [laughter]\nWas a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed the game and he sold it ah I I I don't know I'll have to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game for two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly\nLike one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that the party and it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\nBut I did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was what I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird odd place to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's the problem\nWith being famously wealthy or like the the the person that my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other thing here famously wealthy so you have security detail we talked about this with the president the president has that changed security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to have to be very careful because there are people there are threats against
