last couple of days and I look forward to the next Tuesday and Gary ... is actually the Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get use to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at the Marcus le show dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty ninth on another show but ... again check that out of my Web page there are a number of topics I said I Would get to tonight's I Want to keep my word for someone to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean I didn't think of how this Twenty years ago and so on but I've never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on first a segment at least and see your response\nThe issue is really not that difficult if you knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone it illegal aliens one of the call last night and you know markets legal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or last name\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here illegally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story and in another caller said that why you know why is this going on it's pretty simple\nSo as an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they wanted your home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right they would be asked to prove that it's their account if they said it was there\nHere's your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right they wouldn't be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their account but I just tend to have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access isn't that obvious\nWhich is why it's so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this they can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I have said the left as one of the argument over language\nBut how 'bout to not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from\nYou change the debate watch this to the evil police officers that ice who have the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that they these guys are really clever on the left\nSo the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals ... schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and will never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home run he actually had a right to use the wrong language ... there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I wouldn't say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there were no ... I take it back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be thanks for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government's sending out the wrong message message with actions like buzz legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Ellis Island they were so happy to have landed\nAt the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to an dilute legal immigration and take our country back tell me what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine o seven thirty three twenty nine are mark gosh they're filling in for red irate\nWith what\nI told ... ... oh\nCheck out all the latest news events tracking information jobs and podcasts at red eye radio show dot com that's red eye radio show dot com\nRational drive now with all the one from paying federal stopping center says you can redeem your voices always are far fetched right now by popular requests for one members can use their poised to pay for was are fucking space for dessert fall in line with the truck smart apps\nAnd remember ultra once he's evolving too much for your features and benefits rolling out later this year because this is the ultimate reward shot of more than\nIf you or someone you know it's struggling with addiction please call this toll free number\nRight now eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight by calling your addiction team\nYou're taking the first steps to recovery their advisors are ready to take your call right now your future is still a bright\nPlace the help you need could be one phone call away eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight that eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight this call is completely confidential and if you have private insurance there could be little to no cost to you even\nIf you've already been the treatment give them a call there is no need to let addiction\nRuin your loved one's life\nTake the first steps now at eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight a\nHigh end in Compton for over Thirty years you know the truckers America's most red recognizes that\nNow every week and watch me and my co host Jessica Rose has me bring you the only weekly news show creative just\nJoined us for all the breaking news affecting the trucking industry along with an awesome regularly profile [laughter]\nIn front of the dot com is the one front um you're not going to want to have them busy travel down the highway so tune in every week and watch the news channel my going to the front of the dot com\nCancer has met its match\nDid you travel down the highway signs of tune in every week and watch the news channel by going to the printer dot com and\nCancer has met its match\nTherapy one of the most advanced cancer fighting treatment options now available at MIT's darn Georgetown University hospital\nPrecise than traditional radiation proton therapy targets tumors by conforming to their exact shade sparing healthy tissue resulting in fewer side effects\nStar Georgetown University hospital was the first and only in the region to offer proton therapy to treat cancer learn more at MIT starting Georgetown dot org slash proton\nPaul\nAbout washing my hands\nAny government tries to twenty nine that's right any ... any size twenty nine sixty percent less than the other guy jarred my Sanborn for the queen when you can go down\nReal\nSome knowledge belongs to\nUs alone or in the way our girlfriends along\n\nWhat not [noise]\nThe one that you carry listen\nBut knowing your breath said oh no no\nNo you're through that whole\nFacts on rent you\nOne of five point nine ... Haiti I'm washing mall an eight hour on Washington come to talk about\n[noise] mark\nBack with you again take your calls to eight six six Ninety ... we're talking about illegal immigration\nAnd let's see what friend in Washington DC has to say about it for it [noise]\n[noise] well there\nAre so the language that you were talking about one of the biggest glaring things is that you even do it yourself and I used to do it but I'll marry you say American would actually we are us citizens in America\nAnd the liberals are not liberal that's called radical ... they actually taken at work in a plot to everyone on the side of this so when they when they were talking American\nYou know we think that it's just sitting here now they're thinking the other side of the world and immigration means nothing to do I mean this is just normal stuff and we have been great wars when we say Americans and they they say American save brainwashed us\nTo think\nThat we're seeing citizens and they and they think they're brainwashed us to think that\nEverybody uses American but when you don't get your passport if you have one it's a U.S citizen that's what we are\nAnd that's a huge difference we have to be so deliberate what what state are words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be all the main thing that we have to do even want to air\nBecause the radicals or taking those words and that's what I say about\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word to them I just refuse to do it\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans they'd be you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them usurp that and just because they think Americans ... you know north Americans or whatever they want to use it for ... let them get away with that\nOh and you know some of the songs right America the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAgain I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important to illegal immigrants illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to him and and if you do that and then you're kind of given up a little bit no where Americans we pass for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America where the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electronics\nEffect snow off Lake Ontario on portions

not expecting a lot of\nSnow with the system on Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on ... eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone east of the Mississippi today will be under high pressure and that means clear skies\nYou you don't mean in the United states you mean in this hemisphere out right on\nThe on the you know the ...\nYeah well we don't give a to the Soviet Union I mean you might say now Russia there are certain countries you know you might say well you made like the China you might say we give them aid because they take an unfair advantage of\nUs but there are a lot of countries are doing is actually the\nActually the Russians are helping us more with the satellites right now than we may be helping them financially but that's not your point your point is it is a good one which is we ought to charge the country's um for their illegals coming here I I kinda like that idea\nEven though you know it's a it's an interesting idea\nOr a monitor their own you know\nAnd as you as you're kind of indicating this and they they love to send us they're poor right a lot of especially Mexico right to send us send us the poor and is not our problem right [laughter] you know it's your problem\nAnd then you can also add on to that yeah we build them a little bit below ... street or something you know let me but\nI yeah there's nothing like the right in the Senate and that's the point with right now it's been the wrong incentive to come here as I said I don't blame them and you get to go to school for free you get to have free hospital care right and you get to a drive in our roads you you know we pay for the roads and this is what you you you know I I Would come here to that's why I said\nThe charge interest and we can make money interest\nYou know what\nYeah you should have given this idea that President Trump because that's the way they could be paying for the wall\nYou know any better than I Do oh darling\n[laughter] I don't think [laughter] that's a great call things Steve appreciate\nIt very much actually I I I did apply um someone told me what to do I do know some people and I was thinking you know I'm a teacher too I Love to be a way up there in the department of education but as a person I send to then I think eventually\nHe was didn't work with the president and I have a good friend who's a head of communications for I think the department of health\nUh and so yeah it does happen then you know some people but you know what\nA ... it's tough and and that's one of the news stories that the I think they were having someone else's leaving the administration it's tough to work there\nEspecially if you're a conservative you don't care about the party's you don't you just want to do a good job you certainly it's not the connections you want it it's tough it's tough and a lot of your point that out yesterday that President Trump has given up a lot to become president and I'd say if you could say well it's an ego trip this power all that kind of stuff I don't think he needed that\nI think that was one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing\nI mentioned this last couple of days I think in power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes because they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though oh probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of deal the Russians but even if they don't want business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not their business I Know certain presidents have done on I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know my I don't I I pay what I'm supposed to pay into my share but it's not anybody else's business by the way after the Kavanaugh hearings and all this other stuff if they go after taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why do people want to serve\n... especially people in that sense why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider Democrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance to do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the party that loves to work in government we're the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they're much more likely to say I want to go back to my family into my life because they don't believe in this the whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things he's limited government that government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least that a lot of illegals who come to our country artists\nThat government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least that a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what did he do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country exceptional\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get and I don't try to indoctrinate them I've given both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights you're going to have an energy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible\nThat's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective with the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I don't believe that\nI Believe people will have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right\nLike the Germans were had the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can I don't I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that we have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of and the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it\nAnd then the house and Senate could override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government\nSo that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me while I'm wrong about illegal immigration give me a call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine or seven thirty three thirty nine I more cash for filling in on right on the radio

I'm On this but um\nIn Overland Park Kansas Bruce Rauner with mark\nAnd mark hey God at night over have enough time on this but I'm a uh like the topic on on this I think ... point of view\nI think we need to ensure that our educational system is teaching young kids and young adults what it means to be American it'd be proud to be aware I don't know if that's being done so\nI kind of do it but most teachers do not you are right that that ... their\n... that happened it's in my interactions with people in their twenties and thirties I'm a ... year old man says it will end up not giving you just don't you don't know if you step that pride\nLet's see if he in Dallas so he's he probably doesn't agree with me he in Dallas or on with mark\nLine that more and more [noise]\nOkay so like I was saying before okay so\nAnd I'm a ... hour we're all immigrants okay because well we didn't I mean when the United states was founded on the fact of\nWhat as say St pilgrims\nLanded on saying that rock but the Native Americans were already here so that land was taken from them from the beginning second about\nWashing gap once they took over the land they decided to get in here and go back over the and get African American made ... and everything else and bring him back over there to pick your cat\nOkay then once you leave that say I don't even agree with the fact that in turn down Confederate flag me pulling down Confederate flag or statues because that's how my children\nIs real good to have them up because they let us know that the north won the south loud and then Texas southern states didn't even want to admit that black hurry\nLight it with audit city from the beginning we find out until I Would\nNot generally paint [noise] but yet the gym and do all of the sorry the twentieth of June Eighteenth sixty five so my point being is days you guys want to be ...\nYeah I won't complain about the sanctuary city my whole question is um why ... why me not being in jail for a for\nA civilian what the good girls you know that I'll eat me in this fall and and most of them out in the joined them away but they're not being locked up for a certain crime and they feel like that's really nice for them to be able to be said in those things you have comments\nYou're much more you know ... and I'm about I'm\nGiven I well I appreciate you letting me finish on on the show that I'm doing but okay go ahead I'll let you finish but he made a lot of heavy and\nOkay I mean I'm I'm a cut it out and then you know a lot of times when I look at the the summer of incidents where people have been shot was not people\nI I kinda agree with the police I don't blame them because we shared a you know say you should have just you know and here to what they were saying instead of you to do\nBut still I mean I don't no matter how you get into Manhattan you put it out immigrants to a land that was never our within the first place\nOut in the first place and I know I'm going to want to know if they don't care to go in the history won't feel them around\nAnd respond okay I'm going to try to respond to okay so I gave it a lot of time\nSo first of all you said something about the land was taken from the Indian so that they were here first the only problem with that is there were Indians before those Indians and their India's before those Indians and there was nobody living anywhere on planet earth today that didn't take it from someone else that someone was there originally\nThat's just what happens in life it's it's ... unfortunate and shouldn't be that way but you need to know your history so even Indians took it from other Indians\nAnd in terms of the slave trade you also probably know this may be don't\nMany of the people who are involved in the slave trade were blacks were brought blacks over here I'm not saying it was good it was obviously terrible to bring people here against their will but you do you have to put this in perspective\nThe time it was if slavery was absolutely awful and horrible but if there's one country that's trying to atone for that more maybe more than any other country in the world it's the United states of America we understood that that\nCame out you know they have ... ...\nTone for that more maybe more than any other country in the world it's the United states of America we understood that that they can no ... no no no it's my turn now it's my turn\nAnd we understood I just had a black person that they are I mean the the overwhelming majority of Americans want the best for all their citizens they don't care about race in color and so on and the uh I don't I wasn't sure your last point I wanted to respond to it\nAh but then you say that the police when they do do some shooting I couldn't tell if you were trying to say that they ah they were not being responsible and some case sometimes that does happen someone gets shot never should have been shot and they they're they're good and bad policemen they're good and bad talk show host\nBut in general at you probably know the two most blacks are ah murders by blacks are buying from other blacks and in the inter many inner cities they want more police not fewer because they want to be protected I actually I'm going to keep going longer so go ahead now you respond\n[noise] [noise] okay and like I said no matter how you look at it the one thing I can say if I Can't say anything about\nHow so how president I appreciate everything he's done because the aisle he a dog what Air America dirty laundry it's that everybody weaker right for them under the under the light gets dirt now dated out and being forecast that\nEverybody would knew that we knew that Republicans get dismayed because how he how and how he acts that whatever the case may be\nStill cater to go a long way it goes a long way\nBut I think a lot of people\nLike I saw a lot of my people yeah I can get mad at this man I Want to let the one good thing that he did bring about in this country what air the fact that you know racism and hatred in America alone it's horrible it's horrible\nWay way way way where so where is he wears the racist you mean with the lowest black unemployment rate maybe ever but we were exactly see racist or or I didn't catch that\nI'm not saying like I said he aired the dirty laundry this country had been raped this for many many years what\nEverybody wants so I didn't know that now I now I didn't know that is an all white and he says what\nRadio station ... because yeah very on edge expect black can be to respond on here\nNo I don't expect anybody to respond and by the way I'm by the way you kept saying my people I saw and we're all Americans that we all live in you know bring the same air is John Kennedy said we're all in this together and people on your side and by your side I don't mean color I mean values and politics people on your side I have a group mentality I\nDon't see people that way I see people as individuals\nAnd I want you know I like people who share my values are way way way way back I Know it's not your turn now I'm finishing so let's not talk over each other\nI Would be happy you may have heard me say this this week I'd be happy with nine a black women's Supreme Court justices if they shared my point of view because I don't care about color and it looks like you do\n\nYou still there oh I think she hung up and she didn't make me I certainly didn't I just wanted to know that maybe something happen here we dropped her but uh\nYou know it's just it's it's sad because the old you are there some reasons here yeah there are some people that still think Elvis Presley is alive so you can account for that\nYou know there there's always going to be not cool heads out there but the overwhelming majority of Americans want what's best for every but they live their lives they don't care about color did we make a mistake\nA long time ago we did we paid for that and try to make a difference and then she said oh President Trump a leafy showing how bad things are no I think the country's doing fantastically that's what we did last night\nOh how great the country is under President Trump's ... says some things he shouldn't say or do you notice they'll charge and was stuff like he's a racist but then they can name anything to prove he's a racist right\nOr if it's very discouraging when you get calls like that\nMy people I Love that phrase my people what do you mean then you are people who are the one is caring about color I I don't care to ... ... ... ... miles something I noticed someone's black that lasts for about a I don't know attempt of a second and then I get to know them who they are\nBecause color tells you absolutely nothing about someone it tells you nothing\nI care about values and that doesn't tell me

you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house than I Am about the Senate I think we're going to offer as individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about the have to I don't know what the ... congressional\nUm situation is and I'm In you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I often don't understand why the money when you look at the politicians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrat\nWho live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well in those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax if the governor's race to one by the Democrats in Florida\nAnd he wants to do a lot of radical things and you got as that gentleman a couple of callers ago said you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand their for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrats\nTo invest and and you know be trying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying a tide is it's very hard to explain the conservative Republican positions especially\nWhen the Democrats is much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are ... are on the surface if you don't explored the oh that sounds like a pretty good idea or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about a term but the same job necessarily\nA and that would make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of less than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority of American people do not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was for it was Bill Clinton and what happened he ... he won reelection\nUm people's of American people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside\nThey treated him so badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nAnd what they did the gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leaves leaving that aside they treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and so they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes went to Congress by the way even announced that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or video roads lock\nLake effect snow off Lake Ontario on portions of I Ninety will leave a light dusting of snow near Syracuse Rochester buffalo slick roads not expecting a lot of\nSnow with the system on Lake Erie now from Erie PA oh to Cleveland, Ohio on I. eighty over to Toledo not expecting snow a little too warm in the region the mid west northeastern fact everyone\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing by lived a say in Asia and the thing I could get my kids have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby now of course that could go wrong if babies late I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of your gun laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah\nOwners mark Yes sir hey I'm you're on the market you know well great\nI'm well I'm I recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant\nUm well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then\nShe ... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to a green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way the act and I'm just not touching up from what the previous previous speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about\nThe fact that you can come here illegally have a have a you know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything\nAnd then live off the government um you can't get deported you can um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is an issue I mean people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and\nThen they want to just stay here and and uh it\nIt it's an amazing thing I'm going my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer\n... everything that I guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way they act as the women against violence I'm ... I'm\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the fast track to green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system and and the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a George in Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nGood morning march I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and everyone kind of latch don't suit but I think it's also a misnomer\nWe do not have a illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going on these are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're being invaded by the failures of the other catch\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nThere was any if it was their military doing it we would be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent lay allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and made happens because there are people\nLate allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and they'd happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America Says that the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they they want to fulfill their agenda that is what you're up against President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to someone could calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I probably mess let up standing around with mark\nOn your mark a great call you know they're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey\nIn who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped enemy territory for a while and I hope we can get Menendez\nOut of their uh God but um I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking\nBusloads of people illegals not only voting but bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd and I was sick and um you know how to stop that [noise] and if you remember like during the ah with we were sitting up governments here in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking people who are voting\nAnd dying their ... their thumb purple\nYou know they wouldn't vote more than once and I would say like if we can do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once in a you know disenfranchising other people's vote and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over voter id that the other side made money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's a big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are so you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but\nYou know the oh we're being races were being this you know how could you do that yeah I don't know by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote\nUnless they care enough to put some for some effort\nI'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I think it's also about uh like you said the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I was saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes in to vote\nAnd you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're\nThere voting wherever they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id said you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and\nSay you a digital camera you feed it into facial recognition thing in the tri state area and see if that per person pops up\nIn another war or district or state one of the same day and you know you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted\nPreviously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time he could be starting of voter id form you know they sign that you got the picture you do that you have their address and you know we have to fill out the card and a week or so you know\nYou go back and you bring the the id to them mail it to them [noise]\nAnd ah but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them\nTo see if they're voting in more than one place if they're registered more than one place and well\nThere are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voter fraud they'd think he was off off of that but we I Know that do but there's another point that you didn't think of\nI don't know how your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures of they can't even find my name have the time by Pennsylvania yes or no I didn't know them originally you\nKnow I'm right right so you go in the ... who are you oh my that's you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out\nAnd if I ever seen in vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had it also gives them cameras to take the picture I don't think so but you have to stand you have some ideas have put then that kind of work I have a great evening\nOr tell you one\nI don't think so but you have to stand you ever selected ideas have put in that kind of work have a great evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have a I went in to vote one time it was a primary and uh I had a I asked them if I can have you know a a write in ballot\nOr right and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in doubt I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nFor and it was like I'm\nTotally amazed they say well you know what's going on you know and he said well uh [noise] oh oh you know you're a you're wanted vote Republican and goes a ... or a Democrat\nI couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do it right in ballot and I says well you said I could ... says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write and valid or not\nYou know I\nI thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse than I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats like you can't run if you're a Republican hey why my laughing voter fraud happens all the time let me know
