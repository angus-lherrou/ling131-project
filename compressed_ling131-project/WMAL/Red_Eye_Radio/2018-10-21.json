good topic I I'm I'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but I wanted to also say you know on Facebook\nI'm real good topic I uh I'm actually calling in to a little story but my sister but I wanted to also say you know Facebook I shut down based just because even if I had it with my friends and family only I still found\nEndless arguments on there for I mean just\nFor no reason you know it's almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all on you know um\nIt is incredible what's going on out there and I just uh you know ... cliched it is hard to even hear the story\nThough don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the shellfish they got an ... billion socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw\nA but uh it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way\nI worked at a at a station ... in uh Los Angeles as I said\nI don't want to say too much about it except one of the whole was had a ... have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did to put it in it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a I don't know Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a\nHer father died and she didn't even know it\nAnd I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think it was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him because she disowned him all those years before it ever personal reasons so one has to think that eventually you hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short\nBut when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics they disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship\nJust over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side\nThird discouraging but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMark it's great to talk to you I'm I'm going to get a you know Republican and conservative my whole life and I wanted to military right after high school and um it most of the people um\nThat I let it in the military where which are because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay that kind of you know just that OK well they're there for me then I'm for them I'm not a time when I'm\nWhen I'm the first uh you\nGo for him about\nUm I just remember listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this 'cause at the time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time the car and you just want it to listen and you know I found conservative radio and\nYou know I haven't really talked about it with other people until people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you going for them and it's like people started\nComing to me and pointing at me I wasn't I Would be pushing anything on them and\nUm when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from any friends and relatives just stop paying my friend then I\nRealized just how can you you know for somebody who is this you know terrible and I'm just like you know your stand mad at Republicans for Twenty years\nFor letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him and he still conservative say anything to make our country better and\nYou know I still see people ... to ... am I going to wait a minute we'll be greatest economy in that we in the country's ever seen you know we ...

I wanted to go\nBack to something you said earlier I Believe you're referring to something somebody said about uh this is the times that we live and and I hear that a lot and it's not that I'm trying to argue with you or disagree with you but I think we're looking at it in a different sense that\nI think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more of it's the media so embolden and they're out there they don't care now that I've been trying to hide what tests that they believe in\nAnd they don't care [laughter] and so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage\nAnd that's why they had this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but I Want to get your take on that\nYeah you wow you you may have points I should have brought up thank you Daniel Lee the influence of the media right first of all they don't hide how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertainer when I used to watch Johnny Carson so\nUh I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or a liberal\nBut he never had it out there now again names will comedian\nBut but the media is such a powerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more the blogs and the Internet and all that stuff talk radio\nBut the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN or like the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his name ...\nI don't want to [laughter] to phase out a mountain [laughter] now I and\nMy producer saying Don Lemon you know I mean right and he wants to publicity and they don't you're right and I there is any more they don't hide they act like it as it gets there not journalists the\nProblem I have with it is is that this is supposed\nTo be a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all of it\nThe problem I have with it is is that this is supposed\nTo be a country that has room for all people are all political parties and they're making all about them and that's really an immature a point of view way to perceive of and look at things I mean to\nYou kennel pulled out of their people and that's not what America's top [noise]\nI I got to answer your but I've got aunts my producer who just told me said the Anderson Cooper no 'cause I thought of Jim Acosta and you didn't want me to give publicity but that's the guy and he loves it it's about and so I'm playing right into you know the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my producer he doesn't have it\nTold me to [laughter] wrong but there's so many of them he's actors right right\nAs the days weeks and months go by and in the years go by\nI have a new this trust for the Democrats [noise]\nI don't want to stay in it's correct when I hear that they don't want to\nTalk about issues and I think I remember correctly that will Hillary was running for the White House or the Democratic party didn't all her speaking about issues because they knew that she was so ill and fall off the top of it\nAnd such\nAnd I don't understand how this country can pick a Democrat for any position\nThat will not talk about the issues that will do let them but call somebody a racist homophobic\nMassage in this day and this kind of stuff they getting nothing done when you speak about issues ... gets done that's what this country leads people to speak about the issues loom problems can be fixed the country can be fixed of his ills\nAlthough right now I think is going in a very good direction would trip [noise] uh I think oh if he gets re elected but if he wasn't running I Would love to see somebody that I think is worry it Newt Gingrich\nIs a very man\nAnd it and if Trump or near the White House\nOr tense cancers are would be good also because I think he's learned a lot but I Would ... would be Newt Gingrich as I said he's ... and a thanks for letting me speak in a\nI'll Wait wait wait wait and yet but it was a\nNo no no you got to tell me who you'd have coffee with on the Democrats I'd\nProbably an analyst with the war\nTo try to to try to talk some sense into her stupid head about her claim of being late of American first\nAll right you you got out of it that way it's supposed to be friendly cup of coffee was supposed to be an angry cup of coffee or you guys that don't like the question of some of your body that\nHe had some are certainly had some good points there which reminds me I Want to give my a mark on the show dot com is where you can check on my website and of course in Washington DC or anybody else you can email me\nA mark I sort of AOL dot com M.

of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers is that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show host let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably conservative talk show host or some liberals were most of them are not ... you know what shepherd I been what what kind of America to we have\nIn twenty eight teams when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about\nAll right let me know what you're saying but now you're national forecast for video roadblock\nNo was climate Prediction Center has issued the winter outlook get will be warmer in the west with no change in the chances for snow\nAccording to the national weather service in the Northern Rockies it will be drier and warmer the great lakes region is expected to be drier the southern quarter of the U.S is expected to be wetter than normal\nUh the left is already crazy and and so far out there let's see uh butch in Denver you're on was mark\n[noise] mark how're you doing well\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned briefly a little while ago about a social media and the fact that as having all the relationships friends\nFamily colleagues um I've had experiences where I'd I quit about five years ago because I just couldn't take reading\nSome of the things people were writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to jump in here and and you know say something I might regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on Facebook how I felt you know\nUh back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good\nA with a lot of relationship you know\nMuch started to go in your direction first of all I I gotta say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kind of stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair and he is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you became I've learned not to say much about politics and\nThe ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave you alone it's their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nThat that does some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore though I wasn't on the radio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook\nSo I I think people should be cautious when the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things are hacked into finding out a lot of your information so I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nThe little marked a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I I I listen to a lot of community radio up here where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know both the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything [noise]\nThere's a price part or let the Canadians work aware that\nThe U.S electorate we're going to do it fast can not get the candidate that the media was trying to and this and that worked out in the end so all this horrific stuff that came off of a a\nPaul Kennedy and a a at a Charles Adler and and write and uh and and green or\nAll of that probably helped a jet Obama or get a Trump elected because he was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like ah and\nAh but the reason I called was so weird already been told a for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities\nUh for your Twenty years Thirty years that ah you know nobody was going to be able to stretch theater cities and you know the racial issues that we had to conflict\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected you know we're just mandate anywhere\nClear off on another Chang judge and things got worse so we were very very disappointed or you know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review so supportive and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise]\n... well I think if they voted for him because they want to show they weren't prejudice that was a mistake color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is than he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was my first came out\nI Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the rat Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nYou get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people come pick on Trump that's from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer he's behind that for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike Trump all that is a high bar I've got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in gurney Illinois your honor with mark\nMark I've got two observations and an eight point to make\nA first of all you notice\nAll the calls that you have coming in [noise]\nIt's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships [laughter] that's well that's the situation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated [laughter] yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem that liberal friends [laughter] and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded\nWith the premise in the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in town for individual liberties\nBut they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in this so far out there then you know they claim they're against fascism is example with anti fascist themselves\nThey even when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government whereas we thinking as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so I I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be the little guy and they they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they\nJust care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the ... Democrats that you could count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world of course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democrat Party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what you think he's six six Ninety red eye which has eight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark ... on read I read\nA book with what I told ... ...
