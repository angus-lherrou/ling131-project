reaction to my belief that we've entered a new civil war in this country between the left and right\nI used to say I'm not a violent civil war but I have to what's been happening the last year or so I'm I'm not sure that's true and uh I I think it's going to get worse especially if we talked about this last night especially if the Republicans keep the house\nBecause the Democrats the less the liberal media almost all the same thing they're convinced they're going to win the house and at least take back ... one part of Congress and if they don't buy I Can't imagine what their reaction is going to be\nOn Tuesday Morning I talked about the great job the President Trump is doing and of course the unbelievable anger towards them by the resistance right they even around that coined that phrase right away the resistance like yours is the Nazi Germany or something or fascism and of course that's what they believe\nAnd I also asked you who would be your favorite choice to get the

pleasant fellow\nActually I'm ahead of what's her name of coffee I always say the wrong by what's her name or ... something Cortez yeah Cortez she doesn't even ... and the latest news says that they asked her about whether they would support whether she would support a Bernie for the presidential nomination\nThat I remember I I tears roll down my eyes when he a Trump won Pennsylvania which was always a Republican fool's gold always stay we might win but when it counted like with Romney we always came up short so when he won Pennsylvania real is he was like you going to be president

another teacher said mark let's play knock knock joke so I've played along and his answer to who was there was just a Justice Scalia just died and he said that was funny enough\nI probably didn't hide

never would even think of that and he ... by the way I guess it could affect your son's relationship with his son or daughter whatever it is they say it's awful it's unbelievable\nFor all that's all I

was asking about who would you like to see get the nomination on the Democrats' side and if you were a Democrat who to like say in the Republican side and that evolved into who would you like to have coffee with could you pick someone on the other side\nSo you you've kind of given me an idea that we we can evolve this thing in which you mentioned my monologue Mary Madeline and er what's his name I just lost at a carnival\nYeah James Carville uh they're married and they were stream Lee opposite I worked in political campaigns for a total opposite candidates so here's how this May of ...\nWho you marry mark someone who had really diametrically opposed refused to you [laughter]\nWhy not I mean if you're compatible in every other way and you you why ... why does one little facet of our lives defy everything you know of course I\nPlayed like you're you're consistent but I'm going to play devil's advocate okay\nBecause it doesn't politics getting devalue somewhat about what people care about right or as an example I'll get in trouble with is I think a lotta times single women who vote Democrat or looking for the government to take care of them\nAre and so you start to get into your values system I think\nSo now I'm going to play on the other side maybe not marriage because it may affect lots of things oh give you another one maybe this is very I teach my students values or what should count not so much and I say it's my and you don't have to agree with me\nNot something you know look through obviously important at the beginning but that fades over time it's it's the person's values that you should care about here's one what if you are religious as an example because of that\nBecause you're conservative and you believe in God and the other side doesn't so if you have kids some day you're obviously going to fight about that you want them to go to church or whatever she wants no part of that so I hear I'm almost contradictory myself I Do understand if it's going to be something really permanent\n... share the same values and he isn't this one of the values and I'm not saying not to be friendly\nBut I that's why I'm saying I Want to ask everybody to could you marry someone and you are very ... they said sure why not it's one thing and when I'm pointing out to maybe it's not just one little thing maybe it's something very important what do you think about that\nYeah well I mean we're all Americans here I mean yeah I guess it could be some rabbits Haitians down the road but I mean if you like me and my girlfriend get along and we have a good book for with each other and I love her she loves being I mean\nI I you know I I I Can't imagine that coming up to the extent I mean I'm fifty eight so I don't have to worry about children which is a valid concern\nBut I mean you don't want to go to you know people my mom and dad my dad was a southern Southern Baptists my mom was a Roman Roman Catholic they got along fine for fifty five years you know I I guess you don't love each other's noses in it you learn to live with the other person it's all up marriages without cop lies anyway so\nThat when you're a good my producer is not as good as you he he's he said to me you're going to be divorced than five years anyway if you marry someone of the opposite views he when he was asked me and said\nWell you you have a good attitude about it and you are consistent when I challenge you said yeah what what's the big deal and you're it's very fascinating that you said on these social media sites that it's only one side that says stuff you better not be a Trump supporter of his mark thanks for your call it is amazing\nThat hatred and the anger out there is just\nThe you know for the president and or anything you know that's associated with him right so if you work in his administration you can't even have a meal\nThat's incredible that never happened years ago or they'll protests by your house or the ... what's going on I was someone asked me that puts oil you kind of set of mark what's ... what's happening in this country\nThat's why I said the first nice I I think we're entering a civil war and this is so strong this is so big for some people that the they don't want to accept it let's go to David in let's see if I can see that I found out of New Jersey yeah I can see that [noise]\nYou know you might call it a really the People's Republic of New Jersey my uh brother in law is a political he does not go and my sister does and my brother in law and sister or a family function with my very left wing\nIn it and she

bonkers\nFlights to try to intervene in essentially say oh\nAnd my aunt just who is very well to do is just one absolutely bonkers and\nMy sister tried to intervene in essentially say oh well uh\nI voted for Bertie [laughter] to try to try to calm down but it's I I Will say that if I felt as seriously as the left dies back when as far as I'm concerned the ... candidate Bill Clinton\nWas elected in Ninety two and when Obama got elected I said you know I I did my tongue I even said my aunts and my leading our cousins and my life as far as I'm concerned communist article id and say I'm not going to talk to anymore I just\nI think they know how I feel as I Know they do but\nThe reality is we are as the last caller just said we are American citizens we ought to be grateful I've seen the real world is a former navy guy and they didn't pretty the real world is a very dangerous place in America is the only batch and free and I'm\nDavid First world thanks for your service you know among

have a strong feeling that the end of Thanksgiving right you never want to do that and family functions so I think on our side we we have to accept them for who they are going\nHome I have my my uncle who I consider to be a communist then one day I Will say it to his face not at Thanksgiving but he has a consistent ... a habit of bringing up politics at a\nWhether it's Thanksgiving or Christmas and most of my Irish Catholic relatives are very hardcore left his which brings me to shame because\nI Know what my ancestors went through when they emigrated here and I appreciate that everybody has their own opinion\nBut the reality is if you want to enjoy your meal and be grateful for the ... house so that way you can appreciate the difference of opinion later on I mean I I did back in Ninety two I was disgusted\nAbout Clinton but I never told my cousins or my my answer that we're going to talk to you guys I mean that's to me to me\nI Hope most Americans most of the American people view that as being immature stupid and there is going to be a long term repercussions for it and I I wanted to ask you a question if I could I Do eat your time is pretty\nWell\nIn the People's Republic of New Jersey as in other states like the left coast when there are candidates that are running for federal or state office you don't see Democrats or Republicans [noise] giving a lukewarm endorsement to pro choice or pro life there yeah there are there not\nWhereas on the second amendment there are a lot of Republicans who do not even remotely even answer even the simplest questions than we are to summarize this voters that don't worry once this candidate gets in here she will support the second amendment I I don't see the left\nDoing that on a faith basis for pro choice Democrats in yeah some Republicans like Utah means Romney are we really to believe that heaven forbid mittens Romney as a U.S senator he's going to support the second amendment that I mean given his track record I mean come on\nI voted for for president but like I mean just the idea of having another left wing gun grabbing the U.S Senate on the Republican side doesn't appeal to me any more than the Democratic party candidates\nI think what you're saying\nRambled I've just I I Would say there is some accountability I mean there are Senate races Florida's Governor Scott he just signed into law you got to be Twenty one to buy a rifle for Pete's sake you know most people that don't even know active duty\nActive duty between the ages of Eighteen and twenty army and Marine Corps they're carrying select fire rifles air force you get kids that are Twenty years old that are guarding our nuclear arsenal I mean it's it's totally disgusting that are right that in our constitution\nIs constantly snob then I predict this all the senators and east coast and left coast states get elected as Republicans I anticipate they're not even going to do anything for the second amendment and I'm not saying they don't follow the monkey wrench don't just totally disgusting\nHow I mean you are going to get a question mark next to the name of the candidates are you on the line when you look them up I mean they can answer yes or no gay or night but I don't want to ... you and I thank you for you to make a call\n... absolutely ... you made a big mistake I think he used the word monkey wrench which got the candidate for

you're discouraged 'cause you're libertarian they never win certainly any big offices and I I have friends who are libertarians obviously they obviously because on my side but I Do have people Democrats were my friends and so on but\nThe two parties it it's one of the civil in this country and they get elected to office you got to be Republican or Democrat almost always some small offices even green I Know a Green Party lady who won in Los Angeles actually a friend of mine\nWas small office community college for it but she wanted and I'm just a Green Party member so it can be done but the big offices\nWith all the structure and need the requirements to get on the ballot or certainly for president a working your way down to it's too difficult in a lot of people are going to support you for a third party to make that so yeah I'm Sorry go ahead\nNo that that out of it but they speak I'm Sorry mark a some on the streets of it you know what but what it does it go to the trolls some people it goes roses I mean it it is what it is and and\nYou know when I hear you say you know people hate\nThe conservatives are they hate this you know hey is a very powerful word very power or\nUm you know I Do like some of the people in the other party I mean I'm a I'm a conservative no matter what I Love what Trump do it um you know I I Can't believe that a not a Kennedy by now uh you know and the mob India however\nYou know I hate saying it is it's it's over taken a day and and you know I grew up in the ... we didn't have this kind of hay and uh you know it it it's really hard to swallow watching my\nKids go up in that hate environment and I don't like that or\nMhm [noise] well I I understand that you know I appreciate your call I understand that you don't like no I'm Glad you didn't say you hate that word\nBut I understand that the ... but that's what this is going on and that's why I said ... looks like we have the second civil war notice I didn't say that I said that the I think Democrats Mr misinformed and they think we're evil so that's that's a big difference right there let's go to a\nThat is Joe and stoke silver junior Joe you're on with mark\nMark the morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic and I'm I'm actually calling into a ...\nJoe you're on with mark\nMark the morning [noise] hey I'm real good topic I uh I'm actually calling into a little story about my sister but I wanted to also say you know Facebook I've I shut down base but just because even if I had it with my friends and family only I still found\nEndless arguments on there for I mean just\nFor no reason you know it's almost like they were troubling me waiting for me to say something and then they were all along you know um [noise] it it almost feels to a point sometimes when I'm Talking to people I Can't even really say what I where I stand because people just get annoyed at the main Trump's sometimes you know a ...\nIt is incredible what's going on out there and I just a ... a cliche but it is hard to even hear the story\nThough don't give up maybe someday she'll come around the ... got in fact yeah gentlemen socialism in Europe and what's going on there if you ask most of your opinions I don't think many of them be happy with what's going on I don't know what she saw a but uh it's it's depressing hang in there my friend okay it'll it'll come around some time\nJust hang in there um I was just thinking of a you know people are funny that way I worked at a at a station ... in Los Angeles as I said\nI don't want to say too much about it except one of the whole was had a ... have this a gal on whose father was a famous I don't want to see what he did to put it ... it was pretty famous at us in this day\nAnd they didn't talk for a I don't know Twenty years or something and then um one day a host said to me you know mark a her father died and she didn't even know it\nAnd I had to tell her the news and she said a whole wow I never got a chance to say goodbye so they hadn't talked to her I think was at least Twenty years and you think that\nFinally when he passed on but it was too late to say goodbye to him because she disowned him all those years for personal reasons so one has to think that\nThat eventually hope people come around before something serious happens and I always tell my students you can never tell someone you love enough that you love them because life is very short but when you hear the family stories a brother and sister daughter whatever that because of politics\nThey disown their parent or their brother who they know their whole life assuming there's nothing terrible going on in the relationship\nJust over politics and you see that almost always on the on the left hand side who are just starting but are brought up the topic because it does happen it is something that needs to be talked about like let's go to Amanda in Woodbridge, Virginia you're on with mark\nMark it's great to talk to you I'm I've been to a Republican and conservative my whole life and they went into the military right after high school\nAnd um it most people I'm gonna let it in the military where which are because they felt like the Republicans were the only one that would ever support\nA raise for you know the military pay that kind of you know just that OK well they're there for me then I'm for them um and then as time went on when I'm\nThe first uh you\nGo watch him about um I just remember you know listening to the radio and and just being like I Need to find someone that talking about this time I was driving a lot and and the spending a lot of time the car and\nI'm just want it to you know he's found conservative radio and you know I haven't really talked about it with other people\nUntil people started asking me who you're going to vote for oh why are you going for them and it was like people started coming to me and pointing at me I wasn't I Would be pushing anything on them and\nUm when it came down to trumpet with like for a lot of people around me it was the straw that broke the camel's back and they just walked away from any friends and relatives just stop paying my friend and I\nJust thought how can you you know for somebody who is this you know terrible and I'm just like\nStand mad at Republicans for Twenty years for letting the media and the and the Democrats walk all over I mean this guy won't let anyone walk all over him and he still conservative faith and like our country better and\nI still see people rallied against am I going to wait a minute we agreed to kind of mean in that we in the country's ever seen you know we have it I mean the job of trick truck drivers should at least five thousand dollar bonuses for someone to start the child\nYou know I mean can you actually are\nThat are just they don't have enough people to do them and they and you know these tech jobs that pay huge amount of money so it's like you know if you get the right degree you can get a great job if you if you don't have a degree you get Dr driving a truck working construction and\n\nSeems to be so upset and he'd say close to stand back and look at what's going on but you know I I had a friend\nYeah everyone seems to be still upset and close the stand back and look what's going on but\nYou know I I had a friend you tell me right to my face it I get so mad at you when I when I read that they ... that I just want to shoot you and the head and she laid a hand thing all like you gotta get my head and I said so hurt by that and\nYou know I I haven't talked to her and that was you know nine months ago and\nIt just seems like a lot of my friends are just like you know we can't be afraid to demand that because she like Donald Trump and I just don't want to be around her anymore and\nIt it is hurtful and um we had some time I just felt like I was about ... percent on the Internet because on top of that I'm a transgender woman though a lot of people on the right hated me for a chance at lower hated me because I like Donald Trump\nAnd you know my family a lot of my family is like me because I've transition and and also because I'm a Republican and then I have a ... ... people that look like how can you be Republican nephew chance he hates us and I'm just like oh you know and so it's like all these angles for coming at me\nTelling me that I'm wrong for the little I Am and I don't think that anything worse than my people telling you they can't accept you for who you are\nAnd and it it well\nI feel your pain that I use the bill Clinton line but I can hear the sadness and you know my heart goes out to you you can't imagine what you're going through a\nIt is it's tough enough for the challenges that the regular life holds for all of us alone or when your friends or a band than you and maybe some family members to\nSay it's pretty discouraging I think you need to find new friends you know people who at least will share your Republican views\nUh to begin with and I think you're going to find a not everyone but a lot more Republicans are tolerant despite the fact that we have this view that we're not tolerant people uh that you know we're racists bigots and homophones as a whole is kind of stuff\nWhen we're not you just have to find the right people and and maybe it is that time to do that and maybe joined different organizations that that may be I ...\nI hear a volunteer work for a Jeff does is running for Congress in my area and Jerry Connelly and ...\n... is an army veteran and his band aid on that is also African American Gary Cohn only the older white guy who's been there for ten years called him a racist I mean it's\nQuite a while now\nBy the way I've got I got to thank you for your service and then when my advice to you didn't ask me this just hang in there there are other like minded people but you know in this world\nHe if or when I ask people many good friends do you have in some people breathe say non and some say one and some say to it's hard to find good people it's hard to find special people I just want you know you're not alone that way that we all have those kinds of challenges maybe not your particular challenges but we all have our own Lincoln said\nThere is someone I don't like I'll have to get to know them better\nUh it it's tough life is very challenging and and to be very stressful and it's hard hard enough now we have a different colors are set we've reached a new level where your political views are enough to lose your friends let alone anything else so my advice to you sound like a nice person just keeping their don't give up and and try to find like minded people\nOkay and you have you have a great night [noise]\nUm ... the the thing I just brought this up because I Know it's a

Ontario you're on with mark\nMark thank you for taking my call wow [laughter] it's a world when I'm In as you\nSay [noise] you like ... uh my husband and I we both follow its very carefully what's going on in the U.S [noise] and the state\nAnd we absolutely love Donald Trump [noise] and um [noise] there's a big problem we have to be so careful what we say\nShit here that Phoebe the which is\nThe Canadian Broadcasting Corporation for candidate [noise]\nThey report the news coast to coast and they are all the people the last say\nTrump bashing free\nSeeing cool all day every chance they get [noise] they just [noise] I don't know what is going on [noise] and with people my daughter just graduated a couple of years ago from [noise] ask journalism school\nAgain Canada and she had to be so careful when she was going to court [noise]\nUh to Lena Lena ... because here you can't get a job and Canada's professor if you're not\n[noise] really left [noise] anyway\nThey don't present both sides of the ... at at any of the universities here as far as I Know [noise] and [noise] children today are being brainwashed [noise] it's a social\n[noise] uh [noise]\nIt's terrible what's going on and I don't know\n... people now my rights to assume that people in Canada are pretty far left I mean you got Trudeau now he's pretty pretty far less you had a good prime minister before that\nOh I have to I used to leave this wonderful [noise] uh and [noise] we had our um our cat was not a big deal at all we hardly had actually had a balanced budget and everything was Harper\nAnd the thing is they put him in a to do because of his name uh you know what he graduated from\nUm ah what do you call that [noise] um [noise]\nActually yeah but he went to school for acting saying he'll doing it during his\nActing and thanks for your call he's the acting prime minister he still continuing about the official prime minister I point you make you ever wonder why we ever win an election on our side everybody's telling us they're surrounded by liberals you blind guy the lady will reduce mail anymore\nDaughters sisters a son is it just doesn't seem to matter how ...\nHow do we ever win elections well I guess we're just finding the people that they won't talk to us and the friend us so we don't get you know the people on our side wouldn't do that you don't know who they are let's go to well I don't know if we have time for one more call it wouldn't be fair to you but I'll tell you this\n... is a new time in America and I got to admit it's discouraging when people get on the air and say I got to be careful what I say my neighbors ever knew my point of view if uh my uh friends ever really ... when they found out what my views were I was in big trouble\nI've been to a friend did I mean is this the McCarthy Era of member MacArthur was you know calling everybody communist and ... whatever you thought of him it was unfortunately ruined a lot of careers\nIs that what it's come through and let me talk about myself you've probably heard me say this\nI Am a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show hosts let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that it was probably a conservative\n[noise] I'm a part time teacher and they don't know that I'm a talk show hosts let alone on national radio if they did they could figure out that I was probably a conservative talk show hosts are some liberals are most of them are not I've met many do you know what shepherd I been what what kind of America do we have\nIn twenty eight tea and when you can express your point of view that's what America was supposedly about [noise]\nAll right let me know what you're saying but now you're national forecast for video road lot dangerous\nFlooding continues in Texas there'll be little change today to the forecast\nMore showers for central and north central Texas today on top of what we've already seen there look for an additional two to four inches through the day today and tomorrow it'll be clearing in Dallas by Sunday for the Gulf states look for coastal showers thunderstorms for eastern Florida Today\nMark how you doing well\nGood good hey I just wanted to follow up with something you had mentioned um briefly a little while ago about a social media and the fact that his habits on relationships friends family colleagues\nUm I've had experiences where I'd I quit for five years ago because I just couldn't take reading\nSome of the things people were writing and you know it was opposing me but I thought I don't want to jump in here and and you know say something I might regret or anything but I Know people that don't even talk to me because it was revealed on things but how I felt you know\nUh back when Obama was still president and it just I I think the damage social media has done in my eyes far outweigh the good a ... with a lot of relationships you know\nWhen I started to go in your direction first of all I I got to say my older brother has never signed on in more than one way obviously and was always afraid about privacy issues and that kinda stuff he winds up being right\nOr if I wasn't on the radio I probably wouldn't use faced with that much although I I got to be fair it is good you can reconnect with people when I was a teacher years ago they find me or you find out about someone's life is they just use it for that\nBut I've learned to like you became I've learned not to say much about politics and\nThe ... when they know I'm a talk show host and if they know me already good luck they'll never leave your lawn gets their chance to you know trying to say all kinds of things that they can say if they can't get through on radio so people have no limitations there so I just about I kind of control myself sometimes something gets me so sad\nAnd I think I I'm going to comment on this but in general uh I Try to stay away from it I think the social media you're right\nThat that does some good but the I like I said I don't even use Twitter hardly ever use Twitter anymore so I wasn't on the Rio there are a lot of things I wouldn't do including like I said Facebook so I I think people should be cautious with the social media special we're finding out that they're you know so many things were hacked into finding out a lot of your information\nSo I think it's smart you said you have ... five years and I admire that\nTom in Port Angeles a Washington You're on was mark\nAnd mark a a I Want to do a shout out to your Canadian color out you're still listening I ah I I listen to a lot of community radio appear where I'm at\nAnd she's right it was a it was pretty horrific the way that they you know both the duct tape you she CBS NBC or just regurgitate it everything [noise]\nThere's a price part in it or the Canadians weren't\nAware that the U.S electorate we're going to do it fast to not get the candidate\nThat the media was trying to and this and that worked out in the end so all that horrific stuff that came off of a a Paul Kennedy and a a\nAt a Charles Adler and uh and right and uh and and green or\nAll of that probably helped a Jack o Obama or get a Trump elected because it was trying to hurt for we're coming down from Canada like that\nAnd uh but the reason I called was so we had already been told a for your Twenty years Thirty years that uh you know nobody was going to be able to fix the inner cities and you know the racial issues that we had to confront\nAnd a lot of people a lot of white people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected she ignored his mandate anywhere clear off on another\nWhite people voted for President Obama and then when he got elected you know we're just mandate anywhere clear off on another Chang judge and things got worse so we were very very disappointed or\nYou know the people that voted for the white people that voted for Obama will review review do support it and it damaged the Democratic party for a long long time [noise]\n... well I think if they voted for him because they want to show they weren't prejudiced that was a mistake you know color should never be an issue but I'm sure some people did\nBut the fact is that he was a didn't disappoint me I knew he was I knew he was when he first came out\nI Am not to mention his personality in terms of dropping a bill ... who is the Reverend Wright and pretended that the you know they weren't as friends any more you can see who he was\nHe get to know someone sometimes by a their character I admit people come pick on Trump that from the things he says and does so it's not foolproof but I knew he was far left he he really has got closer and closer he's in high def for for half a second\nI'm no disappointment to me I I never expected much from him and that's what I'm saying the other side the left doesn't understand that we dislike him\nProbably as much as people dislike trouble then as a high bar I've got to admit that ah people who hate Trump really hate Trump let's go to Dave in ... Illinois you're on with mark\nMark I've got two observations and then a point to make\nA first of all you notice all the calls that you have coming in [noise] it's always the liberals\nAnd Democrats that shut off the lines of communication when it comes to personal relationships that's well that's the observation and then also you had a caller who was touting that she was highly educated [laughter] yeah she was highly educated but she was not\nHighly indoctrinated that was the problem with liberal friends and then also when this country was founded almost two hundred and fifty years ago it was founded with the premise\nIn the power of the individual not the state and isn't it funny how the left can sit there in toad\nFor individual liberties\nBut they don't like the founding of the country which specifically states that we have powers as individuals and not not the state over us as individuals but they are fighting for their own demise\nWhen they fight against the founding of this country\nBoy you said that very very well and by the way I don't I don't believe that the left believes in individual rights in there so far out there then you know they claim they're against fascism is example with anti fascist themselves\nThey even when it's convenient there on the side of individual liberty but don't mistake that these people care about and what does this group think what does that group think\nOr they want more power for the federal government\nWhereas we think of as you said we want limited government and the government to stay out of our lives so\nThat you know I don't think that's who they are although they pretend right to pretend to be the little guy and\nThey they care about my minorities and they cared about the basically for no they did they just care about getting in power and most of them many of them are really far left for the adult Democrats that you could count on to be moderate to scoop Jackson's of the world\nOf course John Kennedy a lot of people say when the tax cut that he gave he'd be Republican today\nThe Democratic party that I as a kid supportive and someone said one of our caller said then they left me um they're not the same party they might have been let me know what you think he's six six Ninety red eye which is eight six six nine seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark ice or on red eye radio\nWith what I told ...
