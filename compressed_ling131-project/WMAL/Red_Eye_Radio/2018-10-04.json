uh it's a it's a really interesting article and you and I said we don't make predictions look if you if you look at past history the Republicans should lose\nA house members mhm that's what happens I mean it's almost a a a a a guaranteed right just like when somebody asked us up back in twenty sixteen oh you're going to be surprised Trump's going to win I said well actually we won't be because\nThe history shows us that when you had this long of a down economy the opposition party usually wins and that that's what uh what what what happens what's gonna happen here I don't know it will tell you about you know you saw the NPR\nA poll that showed the um it's evening up now right or as to you know for for the house so who knows we'll just we'll Germany thing by you and uh we'll

intense times that were based on a particular issue ... ah for example after the twenty sixteen election\nWhen when uh a W was talking about uh you know the bridge loan mhm uh\nAnd you had and and and even before that right or before the election\nOr you had the the the passion when they talked about a bailout and right on ... but that wasn't unification there were people there was an intensity there\nThat existed McCain fined gold you and I were working together early on McCain Feingold McCain Kennedy right right uh the immigration bill mhm that was a that was a that is when they you know blue the phones out of the ... of Capitol Hill you remember that when I read that\nWas on a specific topic yeah I the ...\nSame thing right that's yeah titles are short lived yeah sure sure like this this is different because it is about Kavanaugh ... but it isn't just about Kavanaugh right this this this isn't about ... this isn't really about Trump\nAnd reading right here it says the writer than a Wall Street journal or interesting that they write this the same day that you know do the same week that you know you and I are having the same thought going while those the never conservatives the capping off fight isn't about Trump we're all deplorable now\nAh and it says you look at you know talks about the cabinet is a part of you know a isn't part of the whole\nTrump ism thing right he's he's separate from that can believe that we've talked about how many never Trump or as we mentioned this last week how boom I said\nIt's a bull while all of a sudden they are absolutely in in support of of a cabinet and furious and I haven't talked about the never Trump or is it I Know that had built alliances with Democrats because of their hatred towards Trump and now they're fighting with each other\nBecause when it comes down to it well except maybe for Bill Kristol\n[laughter] that was the one old out [laughter] except for except for Bill Christ that I haven't seen anything from Georgia and it's like ... you know if they're not part of the ... he he's not some as they ride and he's done some Steve Bannon insurgent and\nThe judge is the epitome of the GOP legal establishment a Supreme Court nominee from central casting\nAnd it and you know and it's a great point spend twenty six years in public service and the hope what what and that's why it's not about him what I think it what I think it is and I think it's bigger than just Cavanaugh I think it's surreal is ...\nFrom\n... from ... I think you have a realization from a lot of people that don't like Trump yeah and don't like where the Republican Party is going where they've realized\nA we've got to come home for a while because those people are insane I Know a case you're Cortez yesterday said the writers insane or we'll go through whether she actually had any substance to that but when we talked about the many things out there when you see what what\nAre the left is doing to Kavanaugh when you see the presumption of innocence is is gone when an allegation itself is enough to destroy someone's life\nThis goes beyond a political issue it goes to what one Trump the election it is\nThe it is the culture war but it's also and and and I say a culture war because it's a war on it it's it's it's about it's about fairness it's about the belief in the constitution look\nWe don't we were never tremors we've criticized Trump when we were you know we were never on that never never got about ... we voted for\n... you and I don't practice political high dollar tree we don't worship anybody you're not going to see us at rallies going ra ra ra whenever my candidate does we will tell you who was the best ... well you know who has the best idea and what particular issue and why\nAnd we ended up voting for the person who most reflects what we believe not everything that we believe because that would be impossible as and as adults\nWill see that what do we know now you [laughter] [laughter] I mean we don't want to go for air as I read Rick Perry and\nOne of his well one of his first interviews after dropping out of the election ... you know well uh you know I guess he wasn't your first choice they told the interviewer will know my first choice was\nMe [laughter] and and so I I think when when you see that that ... it it's just been it's been brought back to many of these ... going on and many of them when we started making alliances with people on the west or\nYou know trying to build these emotional as I saw on social media from some of the people but I Know that are never Trump hers but all of a sudden the brakes have been put ongoing whoa you'd really do this\nI mean you really do this is what you really we it wow\nWhat were you know we thought you know this is almost like the McCain funeral well we thought that there were actually people out there in the Democrats' side they don't want it to come together to find the common ground that we have and now the realization is no they don't and and I think a lot of people this is a wakeup call\nLook the party isn't perfect\nCat if you listen to the show you know when we talked about the Republican Party or a or listen to the park here from yesterday show [laughter] but the the the party isn't perfect but again everything's when you get to this point of the actual election it's a binary choice\nMhm it's a choice between this group and that group neither perfect so what do you do you look for the best one and I think that's what a lot of uh never Trump or is looking at right now saying\nWhoa ... know who you know when when um oh who was it a try to think of the the the the person oh yeah yeah it was a ... member was Glenn Beck who said he couldn't vote for Trump rather vote for Hillary correct yeah ah\nI thought this would because I I I saw that a a Shapiro interviewed him or he interviewed Shapiro or something like that\nI saw it on social media and a lot of people furious same excuse me he said don't vote for Trump vote for Hillary\nAnd and that kind of you know that kind of thought process doesn't exist right now well except for Bill Kristol a and\nAnd er visits to Jonathan is it ... they're at a\nOn Fox News on the on the the the money block and I think Fox businesses as well he was one of those otherwise conservatives that when it came out with the I'm with her remember that\nI'm with her remember that yes hash tag I'm with her right yeah by the way that was after the the the house report the house GOP report the eight hundred page report on been guys\nYes so I I think that's you know what's happening so again uh you look at that and you say wow ... ... for Republicans then I see this Washington

claiming that they were abused were men but yet he won't defend any women\nI'm paraphrasing but I'm pretty damn close that was the question and she said Sarah Huckabee Sanders answers well wait a minute\nHe he's the one who actually ordered the supplemental background check\nHe's been more than accommodating in this entire process so his comments at the rally or were factual based but he believes that there's nothing to back up the claims\nYou know why because there's nothing to back up the claims the left it once again has created their own little fantasy that these are credible claims but sorry in this setting there or not if you can't find anyone to back it up\nEight six six Ninety red eye looking to purchase your own truck or a trailer and Giles financial company may be

Carter right need the I Believe it was both of them that did the story on the Pfizer courts rebuke in the Obama administration this goes back to ... way back in May of\nOf of twenty Seventeen well his story goes to the specifics of it and the specific of the allegation will get into the the the details of it but here just as the first line congressional investigators have confirmed\nIt because I could see a a rural being enforced is breaking the rules and and it is punishable I don't know what that punishment is um but certainly\nYou don't ah you you've got to be careful I guess which way you go keep in mind in the house things may be working for Democrats according to the polls maybe right now but in the Senate there's a lot of close races and there's no one\nNo talking about a blue wave in the Senate so you have to assume that McConnell still going to be in place or in the new year but the point being\nA Democrat doesn't want to go out and blatantly violate that rule\nAh because they know internally that's going to create a lot of problems for them going forward\nI'm not saying they won't do it but but uh there's a huge disincentive for them to to to do that but you probably could see them saying look\n... and it it's going to be this is already this from the liberal media or NBC News on on Wednesday while there are dozens of people dozens of people I think they said over forty people\nThat have said that that that have ah have information at potentially they could be witnesses that's one of the words they use potentially and their story or that that could help substantiate all these claims and blah blah blah\nThat's not how this works they don't get to control that but the but nonetheless that will be the narrative and you'll probably see a couple of senators or during the day on Thursday or friday more likely on friday as they try and hold up an elevator doors open\nThey're going to try and and block they're saying this was not enough that the we need of a greater background check they did an interview enough people uh they didn't talk to\nFord or Kavanaugh there's new allegations that are coming out yeah uh that are uncorroborated too so we need to investigate them since there is no cooperation we need to find the ... I mean it's going to go down to the ... but I I I Do\nBelieve that because the ah Republicans most likely want to abide by the rule that Democrats will do everything they can to claim\nFor example is Adam Schiff has done all along and Adam Schiff firms and not on this but Adam ship since we will be talking about\nUh the whole a Russian collusion investigation coming up in the bomb shell or out of a of out of D.C yesterday about the James Baker ... uh uh apparently telling the house or the house uh uh I don't know which paddling was\nBut uh in in test closed door testimony yesterday telling them have talked to the Democrat the Democratic national committee's lawyers right before they got the warrant right and and and James Baker top FBI official\nA at that time which without question shows that politics played a part and he talked to them about\nWhat was going on and he talked to the DNC lawyers about the Trump Russia collusion investigation that was going on which is absolutely the wrong thing to do right now you cannot nobody can defend that in an investigation so it's getting to where you want to\nTo where you and I asked questions over a year and a half ago is this where this is going and we ... you know the thing is every question that we asked about where this were what might have happened here in what they might be investigating every single thing that we asked the question on has come true\nIt is all come out in a in a series of reports you know if you look at it ... it or well at least it's it's there has been people the media has looked into those questions I guess we can say right um that\nWell first of all one of the first questions the big question really was there a potentially is there are we looking at possibly a gross abuse of power under the previous administration that that a person or persons\nKnowingly used false information to which is a the Giuliani pointed out you know there's a there you have there's your your your perjury um but they they in soliciting for bats are Pfizer court warrant\nAnd we'll get to that coming up falling off the top of the hour might point out Adam Schiff has do Adam Schiff\nHas claimed for the longest time that there is collusion their ... and since we can't see it he's able to claim that there's collusion and out of the feeling the Democrats do the same thing here claim that there is evidence yeah I Know in this because the Republicans won't release it so they won't release or do they know the Republicans won't release of because Republicans\nYou know a ... ... ah in the in the Senate want to keep a this\nRural and the fact that hey we can't be ... not every background check we do of every ... of of every judge we're not going to do that\nAnd so I Believe they'll use it to their advantage and may force the Republicans to release it here\nIn the next couple of days I Believe that will be one of the tactics that we will see tomorrow I Wish you and I could finish the show here in the next twenty minutes and we could just repeat the ... the first two hours the rest of the show\nGo home get some sleep and then wake up at seven AM [laughter] so we can be up all day tomorrow because I really don't want to miss any of what's going to be going on but in the ... I really think that\nYou may see that let's head right do you go to markets in Virginia\nMarcus welcome you're on the Radio Welcome to the show high [noise]\nSaid hey I just what you say an Adam Schiff should be investigated I think he spent a leak in the old time you may you know [noise] I I Know\nYes I mean well I don't know ... foot right we all believe yes I mean I grew up in a a whole family a Democrat my whole life and even even my father lifelong Democrat my sister my brother in law everybody [laughter]\nThey're like totally disgusted with what is happening with the Democrat Party [noise] yeah I and I don't think it's going to last I mean they they uh overplay their hand while they went off the rails said\nThey did but keep in mind markers and and and thank you for the call we all share is a\nBig big old there hey my I got two kids in college and a fake socialism the greatest thing in a world\nOh sure and and that's what's going to keep the insanity alive that's why it's not really there I don't see them coming back from where they are a because this is now the mainstream the mainstream has to follow look [laughter] uh it doesn't matter a who's a protester is or what the causes\nThe party the protestors the far left now leads the party they lead the media they're very active in the media [laughter] they're part of the media you know that's what the ah you know they were saying former CNN officials or or or management including Ted Turner\nAre saying they become a CNN's become too political and Jeff Greenfield coming out saying who used to run CNN coming out saying you know it's the these the people at CNN believe they are part of the anti Trump resistance their activists as we've we've known for a while but\nThis is not going to change it's not going to end they're not going to they may have overplay their hand here but what they'll tell you is we didn't do enough\nWhat they'll tell you as we didn't wrap it up enough\nAnd even if he's confirmed this weekend\nAnd we move on from this they don't believe that they're empowered\nBecause they at least got the delay got they got they got the supplemental background check done and all of that they put the pressure on Trump and and they were able to manipulate Trump and the Republicans although it's Jeff Flake and that's that's going to\nIt but on the or the other side they're going to know or that they're in they're in trouble because you because at the Supreme Court at this point than you have\nPoint then you have a a a fight for maybe not on everything that would be viewed as originalist store construction of stores they call it conservative which would I think is mislabeled ... of it but they will uh uh you know it's going to it they know\nThat if Trump is reelected in twenty twenty that's why I think they're going to go up up the insanity or whether they win or lose any seats or whether they take over the house or whatever there is going to be pure insanity from now till twenty twenty\nBecause they know that if there is it between now and twenty twenty if there is a Supreme Court a seat that opens ... we've seen how insane it's been now where they're promoting the fact that there is no presumption of innocence right why this is where they are right now so far where they go\nWho knows but they don't ... I Can't\nI don't think they can imagine Trump being president until twenty twenty four because there's a possibility of more Supreme Court seats that was your civil they moderate their message in order to maybe be able to win\nOr will they just up the insanity for the next two years yeah the uh the Trojan Horse a tactic\nOh we'll just moved to the middle\nA little bit in order to gain power right which is what they used to do that is what I said yeah but they pretend to move yeah middle ... eight six six Ninety right I [noise]\nIf you've already been to a treatment give them a call there is no need to let addiction ruin yours or a loved one's life take the first steps now at eight hundred three nine o\nNine five to eight eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight that's eight hundred three nine o nine five to eight\nProfessional drivers your favorite magazines are now on stands and ready for you to read cover to cover truckers connection offers great jobs entertainment industry news each month\nJob opportunities for owner operators is easy to spot with a hot right on the cover and the best career options for truck owners inside\nFind truckers connection and job opportunities free at ... traveled centers of America will those and other truck stops nationwide truckers connection and job opportunities for owner operators we're searching for greener grass just got easier\nDo you what I Would watch WMA I'll watch\nField you any yeah let's say\nI'm not really a princess senators are expected to receive that report today from the FBI on Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh's investigation when the Kenyan report the FBI\nWas given one week to conduct an investigation into allegations of sexual assault or misconduct by Kevin ...\nThe allegations date back to when Kavanaugh was in high school and college and Kavanaugh strongly denies them the senators will get to review the report under restricted conditions that the report they viewed in a secure room and then it's not they relate to the public acts in any bomb shells from the FBI investigation\nInitial vote on Kavanaugh's nomination for the Supreme Court is set for friday and a final vote could come as early as this weekend [noise] Lindy Kenyan washing\nThe largest coalition of Christian churches in the U.S financial council of churches wants Kevin ... throw his Supreme Court nomination at a state but the coalition wrote that at last week Senate Judiciary committee hearing Kevin showed quote extreme partisan bias demonstrating he lacks the temperament of joined the high court\nOr federal judge has blocked the Trump Administration from deporting thousands of immigrant us\nDistrict judge Edward chin has issued a policeman or injunction the bars the Trump Administration for ending the temporary protected status program for more than three hundred thousand migrants from Haiti El Salvador Honduras in Sudan who've been allowed to live and work in the U.S for decades\nCan rule determination will result in irreparable harm in the ministry she may have sites that federal making guidelines and violated the equal protection clause but basing its decision on hostility against quote\nNon white non European immigrants and this is the latest blow against President Trump's effort to overhaul the nation's immigration laws following court orders limiting his travel ban in his attempt to end the deferred action for childhood arrivals program ...\nWarning of the possibility of more flooding in the Phoenix area still runoff from remnants of a former tropical storm that dumped record amounts of rain on that city\nHey it's Larry O'Connor and believe it or not Thanksgiving at my holidays will be here in the blink of it I Can't believe it's true though so is your home ready for entertaining your family and friends are your carpets looking or smelling\nTo be embarrassed by dirty carpets just calls zeroes they'll have your carpets looking smelling and\nFeeling brand new again they've done it for me and I got to tell you is there were red clean is the\nBest whether it's your home or your office is zero will have your old dirty carpets looking new again don't spend all that money replacing your carpets when all you need is a zero ... claim stains and orders from the kids or pets will be gone forever allergens in mold will be removed so you can breathe easier again don't have carpet\nThat's no problem as there were ... clean can also work wonders on hardwood floors tile and grout\nCalled zeroes right now ask for the W A L special get three rooms of carpets cleaned for just a hundred and forty seven dollars plus a hallway clean for free minimum supply all seven oh three three eight to twelve Twenty one Seventy three three eight to twelve Twenty one or online at zero\nOnline at ...

Carter ... memory is correct here are the ones that broke that story for circuit dot com back in May of twenty Seventeen that defies the court had rebuked or the Obama administration\nThe Obama administration for violating the rights of American citizens or after they broke that story it really didn't go anywhere we've always wondered okay where did that go did Congress do any type of oversight or over that so much his top secret when it comes to the size of court that that story came out\nAnd then not much happened afterwards uh but that's where I really first you know got to know John Solomon some of his work he's been around you see him now on on different um\nYou know a panelists and uh on on different shows out there but he works for the hell dot com this from the hill congressional investigators have confirmed that a top FBI official met with Democratic Party lawyers to talk\nAbout Donald Trump and the Russian collusion weeks before the twenty sixteen election and before the bureau secured a search warrant targeting Trump's campaign\nA former FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney for Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee private law firm\nThey must believe that the inspector general can find the corruption in the department of justice concerning the procedure over the Pfizer warns\nYeah\nYeah that's if you're listening for the first time I know that this is all calculus I think most people that have listening for a while to the show understand where we are going\nWell it it it ultimately when you when you look at that especially with the I. G. being given all this ah on redacted information from the White House\nYou you know that there's only one reason the inspector general exists\nThat's to look and see if there's any kind of corruption or misdeeds\nStealing in the department of justice accounting irregularities things it's like a pencils home things like that and just you know if you're new to the show what we've always talked about is the Democrats have said Trump polluted with Russians to hack the election mhm that was the initial charge or what have we all find out and we all know now nobody's debating it\nIs it was the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary campaign the paid a law firm ... within paid a opposition research firm fusion GPS who paid a former British spy who got dirt he says from people close you know Russians close to the Kremlin on verified that they\nThen taught to use against Donald Trump to defeat his campaign\nWhen that didn't work tried to destroy the legitimacy of the election and use that unverified information that they got from the Russians are to get themselves a Pfizer worn a secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign\nAnd what we're being told now is that somebody from the FBI met with the law firm who helped initiate the whole thing along with the DNC and the Hillary campaign right before the Pfizer warrant was issued and just weeks before the campaign yeah so hopefully that does I think that explains it all simply as you can explain it\nAnd a number of details coming about the you know with the Solomon a report that broke on on Wednesday Wednesday evening and then of course you'd go back to the fact that a Bruce or or at the time of high ranking a an official at the department of justice his wife worked for\nFusion GPS\nSo there are

that they didn't think they were actually going to be able to stop the confirmation of Kavanaugh so what they've been doing is laying the groundwork to once he's elected and there's on the Supreme

getting where with it\n[laughter] okay 'cause I've heard lawyers you know\nTry and no show that judges should recused themselves Oh yes for an hour well\nYou know when they lose the electoral vote than we should do away with the electoral college if they lose this then you know that we should do away with this process we should change the way that Supreme Court justices are seated and we should and it will be all about well we don't we didn't get our way so we should change the rules right\nAh and by the way that call happens already in the Supreme Court mhm yeah I Can't remember we've even there's been some cases were or even said some of the judges mhm should recused themselves or I Can't remember a specific one right ah right off the top of my head but I Know that we've talked about that in the past and I don't remember I\nCan't wait we're an appellate judge on a case yeah you know and before they receive the down the ... got to the court after they were seated on the high court that's happened or they argue the case or something um then but but again that's up to them because if it's or or are there\nFor example they're arguing the case of deals with the law or you know with the company and their wife works for the company and writes for the economy at that point you have to recuse yourself\nBut to say as we've been we've we've heard for example well they can't he can't ruin anything that involves the Democrats because he's been partisan and he got angry at them and that's not going to hold any water yeah\nI Do remember when the talk about ah you know his nomination this was back during the Gorsuch nomination process uh the talk was well the the president should nominate his sister\nYou know and it was like OK let's [laughter]\nShe would have to recuse herself from every case of that [laughter] well that company is indirectly working with my brother's company and the and you know you you get the the the whole thing and and of course you know the fact that the well she's part of his family but\nThe ... the\nThe process and you and I were having this discussion during the break\nThere is a great deal of respect by everyone that's seated on the court right now for the process not that they make a decision that we always agree with in fact the uh well I can think of free that often make decisions we highly disagree with 'em or for sometimes with John Roberts [laughter] but\nWe can talk about that but the procedure on procedural issues\nAll of the justice that justices that are seated right now on the high court\nHave a great deal of respect for those procedures and how you move forward with the case\nUh it is not it is not driven like this\nThere's not driven like the social media world of today at the Supreme Court in terms of procedure\nNow the hearings often how these interesting comments that come out of him and questions that come out of him and then the media takes them and runs with them often out of context or they did that with Scalia um but you know there's but but still in terms of the procedure there is a great deal of respect why each of those that are ...\nAnd you know but I can make a great point by saying the world of the Supreme Court or even the\nFederal judges to begin with is not the social media world but I I'm I'm Glad you made that comparison that is not the social media world that we live in for example most people don't know\nThat a former Justice Scalia\nAnd Ruth Bader Ginsburg were great ... great money to make that their ... their their family their families used to\nVacation together yes that's how tight they were you could not find two polar opposites so what you what you end up getting is a there is when you get up that high in a very very unique job\nThere is even even if we can sit here and and we have and said we don't believe that this person respects the constitution\nThat there is a camaraderie that exists for the process and if you were to ask the judges privately what they believe\nAbout the process of cabinet is going through right now I bet you the majority of judges would say it's absolutely horrendous and should not be that way because it means\nThat door this is my point earlier about what I Believe and how the rule came about by the Senate in two thousand nine controlled by the Democrats that keeps this process of the background checks secret and the content of the three oh two cigarettes\nIs likely because of exactly what we're seeing right now and that is if this uh if some content came out just imagine that we never heard Dr Ford's name but the plane came out the what they would do is look at that and go okay well is there anybody backing it up\nBecause the claim would be in the three oh two except if they found that they couldn't find any anyone would first hand knowledge of the event\nOr the claims then they would say we couldn't find anything to corroborate well they know the Senate knew back then that you take something like that a simple claim that cannot be backed up and it could be it could derail the entire process and that's exactly what\nWe're looking at but here's here's the point that nobody's talked about\nWith all the federal judge ships out their forget about the Supreme Court just the federal judge ships out there that background checks are done\nHow many thousands of claims that are under cooperated when you think about the federal federal judiciary out there and the process that they have to go through and the background checks that are done\nHow many thousands or tens of thousands of allegations are made that are on cooperated in order to defeat somebody and never get known to the public eye only reason this one did was because Dianne Feinstein said okay this is going to be the exception to the rule\n... we would normally never do this this is against complete protocol what I'm doing complete the set a complete protocol we don't do this but I'm doing this because\nThe end justifies the means in this case we cannot allow a five to four majority that is a more construction is\nWell journalists core and then learning of this this rule now it puts it all into perspective she knew that if she turned Feinstein if she turn this information over to the FBI to vet as a part of the official process it would've it would've been in the official three oh to report and you wouldn't hear about\nIt when it would've never it would if you do that so that when you think about that that's the whole point\nNobody would've ever known that this existed right her name would have never come out because everything would have been on ... ... we're not that would not have been able to\nCollaborate and then at that point it died just like probably the thousands of other allegation and you know that have come out against other federal judges and Supreme Court justices\nOver the decades and that's that's it because you could you could start easily a smear campaigns simply with a claim now now it makes sense as to why Feinstein for her politically and why were there her end\nAnd and for her side at least up to this point why it was more important to leak to the media and certainly you could not take it to the FBI because if that were in the report of the three oh two we wouldn't hear about it\nYou know why Lindsey Graham was so enraged yep eight

news and and this is really huge when you think about the whole Russia investigation over the last uh a couple of years\nOr this it's been a you know a reporter that there was an explosive testimony or a yesterday by a you know Well hi FBI law enforcement official a former official well the hill dot com John Solomon\nA has released the name and the details he says congressional investigators have confirmed but a top FBI official met\nWith the Democratic party lawyers to talk about allegations of Donald Trump Russia collusion just weeks before the twenty sixteen election which would make it right before the search warrant they got the search warrant targeting Trump's campaign came out a\nFormer FBI general counsel James Baker met during the twenty six teams season with at least one attorney from Perkins Kuwait the Democratic National Committee private law firms\nJust we we like to do this because we can do it within twenty seconds just so in case everybody know nobody knows it's the Democrats that ... ... you know they accused or the Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack the election\nOkay remember that was the original a charge what we found out since that time\nWas and nobody disputes\nWhat I'm going to tell you right now that the Democratic National Committee in Hillary Clinton's campaign gave money to their law firm ... law firm Perkins Kuwait who then gave the money to an opposition research firm called fusion GPS which then hired a former British spy\nChristopher Steele who then got information he claims from people Russians very close to the Kremlin\nWhich was unverified still to this day and verified in order to uh destroy the reputation of Donald Trump\nDuring the campaign to hurt the election and when they couldn't do it to destroy the legitimacy\nOf his election after he was elected a lot of that information and that dossier promote we know was the major source for getting the secret warrant to spy on the Trump campaign and so now we know that right before that the FBI\nLead counsel met\nWith the law firm Perkins Cooley\nThat really when you look at it they're the ones that started you know the the money started flowing from the DNC and the Hillary campaign [laughter] we got to the law firm they were the ones that were distributed to fusion GPS I mean they were you can look at them and say OK they were the lead organizers\nRight and I would counsel for the FBI do that I mean if you if you said an investigation was ongoing and looking into it and lead agents were there to question\nThe the the I guess the principles of that law firm and others in that law firm that would be you could just easily I guess\nA compartmentalize that as part of an investigative process\nWhy would why would the counsel for the FBI do as they say well as well as he says to talk about\nThe allegations of the Donald Trump Russia collusion or just weeks before the twenty sixteen election\nBut it was lawyers meeting with lawyers right why why not an agent's asking some questions of the attorneys no it was attorneys and attorneys meeting\nSo former general counsel James Baker while he was with the FBI or met during the twenty sixteen season with at least one attorney for ... the Democratic National Committee he's private law firm ... that's the term used by the DNC and Hillary's campaign to secretly pay research firm fusion GPS\nWho then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compiled the dusty a oven cooperated Ron televisions alleging Trump\nFusion GPS who then paid Christopher Steele the former British spy to compiled the dusty a oven cooperated raw intelligence alleging Trump and Moscow were colluding to hijack the presidential election\nThe revelation was confirmed a by both testimony and other evidence secured by a joint investigation by Republicans on the house judiciary and government oversight committees the sources tell a John Solomon from the hill dot com\nIt means the FBI had good reason to suspect that dossier was connected to the ... main law firm and was the product of a democratic opposition research effort to defeat Trump yet failed to disclose that information to the size of court in October twenty sixteen\nThis is a bombshell that shows the real collusion was between the FBI and Donald Trump's opposition the DNC Hillary and the Trump hating British Intelligence officer\nTo hide that Jack the election rather than some conspiracy between ... and Trump a source told John Oliver\nBaker then was interviewed a Jim Baker was interviewed a by lawmakers behind closed doors yesterday\nSources declined to divulge the testimony others uh other than to say it confirmed other evidence about the contact between the Perkins ... law firm and the FBI we bought the state of the ... I mean it's it's mind boggling when you think about it is a movie it's not a movie\nThis this could be twenty four yeah if you do a capital a season though you could do probably more seasons then law and order a couple of seasons of it because we've always broken down\nAnd since we've been on for such a long time I do believe that you know you could include us in the group that was first in asking so many of the important questions on this [laughter] but when you think about it it was the Democrats that we're accusing Trump of colluding with the Russians to hack end or changed because of change then to hack\nAnd or to change the outcome of the election and then in reality what you find out it was completely the opposite the people the party that was making the accusation they were the ones yeah\nWho colluded with the Russians to get dirt on Trump and verified information still today is\nHeld by the way if it's done verified as far as I'm concerned this long the vast majority of it it's\nFalse after that I've had run over after over two years right so and and and so they did it to destroy his campaign and when they couldn't do that it was to destroy the legitimacy of a lead shit presidential election in the United states\nAnd they tried to do it by taking that information\nThat information and and just do well faking it as in allergens instead of opposition research to the Pfizer court to spy on the Trump campaign exactly the accusations they and they still make it against Trump\nYes they still make the say he's treasonous for Russian collusion right and when you look at it the actual Russian collusion was completely from the other party and all those things that I just brought up right now\nAll the way to the whole Pfizer court and you everybody knows it's true I don't know of anybody decide or or that is a it tried to\nEven debated especially after the you know the work done by Sarah a quarter and Solomon and others at circuit news or when you started seeing some of the documents that were that were coming out um and what was going on to the behavior of the previous administration I mean so many of these pieces of the puzzle that have come together in the last two years here's the problem\nWith having something go on for so long where it is active because it is still active smaller and his team are still working which means it's still\nRelevant even though right now on the left they've gone very quiet on it\nIt's that you have more time to shed light on the truth\nThat's a problem for anyone who may be guilty of doing anything illegal in this entire scenario\nWhat you think about it I Can't even apply to what's going on with the allegations against cabinet right\nThe longer that you go on and you look at the you know the allegations that have been made the story starts falling apart as more\nInvestigations go on as you've seen you know with the ah the ah you know Evan Eddie's right a a thing and then you sit there and as time goes by and you see that it still remains\nYou know a mill cooperation for these particular stories right they they go nowhere mhm and so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more of the truth\nAnd so the longer time that you do with whether it's you know you're you're able to find out more of the truth\nAnd like I said more the truth of what we have seen it but the Democrats dead wood Stein Feinstein did you know the the the fact of you and I talked about this earlier the fact that they actually could have kept her name secret yes", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington", "day": "04"}
