I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho is a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm\nAnd move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know\nWell no that's not the point that it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we've been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and they could they could gain more seats\nInstead of losing seats and this was back then not rise early now we're talking about getting a message across to people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president right now or they're capable together of getting real things done and they need to get our message out there but\nThere is this and and we continue to to fight this all the time were where we get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody or we don't know\nWhy who that's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that\nLook people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population but people learn every day and\nA teacher's politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that have called the show and upset you know I used to think this way and then I started ... you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I change my mind completely ... people change their minds you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind though you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base [laughter] never being satisfied with what you have always trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have sought us out you saw it on shows like this he sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you're already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably ... I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win\nThat the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate he knew he was a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people runners you guys don't understand the frustration out there you're kidding me [laughter] ... if you liked or just what you like\nAnd that's what I Love when people runners you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me in turn you liked or just what you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here [laughter] yeah that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years yeah\nIt's really an Tom [laughter] it's always a very old hide scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time meditation oh it's like sitting on a beach it's like they're just sitting there and\nI'm ... I I got friends in St Thomas sending their emerging island saint Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is\nDay after day here as pure as and and so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree with that you believe is unfair and\nIn some cases evil no that's not our goal look\nAfter them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the ... the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mass of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping and you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board already\nWhat frustrates me is understanding that the left uses the heat of heated rhetoric that they that they use they do that out of desperation they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell mhm we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need it that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a

thousand eight on hope and change\nTo just the other night and Nevada bill ... who vote ... almost big was it because it became ... if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you what I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater\nBrock Obama this big speech built on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and vote they're going to win the ... ... okay thanks kept an obvious we already know that\nDon't boo vote okay can you can you\nCan ... and ... and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issues that's the difference look at you know we've talked about how we don't like to political ideology on either side and but I Do understand\nThat because of political ideology on on the left\nIs based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate it's still always has bothered me but the fact is I Do understand that people have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas right\nThat our species that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty\nPromoting certain principles and ideas right that are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you ... you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost

I was the Republican that weren't even saying twenty five percent during the whole discussion on it and we didn't think they would get anywhere close to Twenty one percent so it's you know this this whole thing\nOf of being long lasting a good economy is not going to be defeated\nBecause the American people want to keep it going I'm\nThe last of ministry ... tried that they tried everything they could to step in the way of private sector you didn't build that that was their attitude that was the attitude by the former administration but the the fact of the matter is is private sector built all of it the roads the bridges and business but\nThat's the point is that right but the the story that their referencing doesn't actually say that they could turn out to be the case and maybe National Review has sources of their own but they're not sourcing they're not using those sorts that the rats from the a P right\nYou know so it it's just because the\nProblem is with with if you're going to you know that if that are in the echo chamber of social media especially if that false information misleading information is going to be out there\nThan it is you know it it starts to become or build a narrative in the wrong direction if you start on the wrong premise everything that follows a may sound logical but it still is built on that false premise so\nYou know we just ... and we have a great deal of respect for the people over at National Review yeah events ... where's that oversight here in my opinion because that's not what the Associated Press story all\nI can understand it because when I read it the first time mhm that's what I said do you write I said oh there's there's I'm reading here says the ... and then I read it again I went oh\nNot what the ... Washington Post on there headline had it right there headline had that the powder that was sent along with her was harmless you know along with the suspicious\nPackage was harmless and and so the the point being is that\nThat the narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that and\nYou don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now\nPeople are going by their trust of National Review\nYou know based on the headline which which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time I I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told you as an earth they're saying the bomb was harmless but this was in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press to separate the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone off and uh and you know and and whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever\nOr were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually\nWeren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point you would look at it and the questions that you would ask as an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm poor they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs\nAnd they were sent for a political statement would be the next question that you would ask the right\nSo again we don't know and that's why we ah when we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the fact they don't know\nWe have no idea that the motivation behind the the the uh the person or persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against divisiveness and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter]\nWe're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing yeah right\nWe got on the left doing that it's like [noise] [laughter]\nWe're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well and especially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces\nThat we've got to ... in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work\nAnd I know sources of so they believe it's the same you know right people are ... person or group of people based on the material which again that that the number of the number of of\nAh devices that you sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly [laughter]\nYeah if you look at the nature of ah how this was sent a the the packaging the ... if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr ed you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts um each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male uh usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that sort and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service for actually has their own sorting that they do so the mailed doesn't doesn't son delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that\nThey have a a great deal of resources the the Secret Service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days that they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from\nOh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now whether these relied bombs or not they know right they haven't said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go online and could have been triggered by\nA ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\nWell because in in it and I know is is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out of conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigative reason why you wouldn't do it well\nAnd if they were armed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city\nAh right there in the building to CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock some time that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm ... and so does that tell us anything about\nThe threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nYou know because if they were armed and they were ready to go often and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clinton say oh they always have as ex presidents to a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that's the if the threat is real enough that were at that device word dangerous or we're ready to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but\nI don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets war who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we ... we we've seen the pictures on on uh on line and in the media\nAs to what the packaging was at least with a CNN device but again where the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are\nIt was all together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they're really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion eight six six Ninety read

science route front of you know the that you could tell me okay this is early voting began with a political science all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know what when I see it because of political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were ... the only thing is they\nDidn't have any parking if you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse fried or where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further couple of more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said I Want to check out but the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot walk through pouring rain but when I got in there everybody friendly ... no

I how many units are in there maybe three four hundred day it's it's pretty big issue ... uh and the rate of construction every time we kept\nIt it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you

the Gulf Coast and provide heavy rains from Houston over to New Orleans so I can certainly you only the windshield wipers on through a good portion of the south as this system continues to move eastward\nA exist that being said the care of them currently moving from ah the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration\nBecause they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders\nBingo we've been saying for years\nAnd this is what we said ... pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and earlier this week as well they have to be positioned to very clearly the question has to be asked\nWhere do you stand on the border\nThey must be\nForced to say it\nBecause it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\n[noise] he said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have been raised in immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and a former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we upset that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president\nTo back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have a comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back ...\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on the show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy ...\nWhich was the amnesty that was two thousand five just if they they made the decisions to couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years of Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration ... when they do\nWell with their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that the Republican failure mhm because the Republicans should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders and when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done issued them the challenge and that's what it was shown as saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had\nThey don't ... they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response\nThey some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice you don't get rid of border enforcement in this country\nThat's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we have brought to your attention\nThe demographics that want the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ... when\nYou look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level of legal immigration that even Trump\nHas never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm\nNow the American people stand with the president on border enforcement\nThey do\nHe's winning that politically\nThe other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want\nAt all you know what the president wants\nYou know with the Republicans won and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them in back them into a corner and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll pull ... we're going to pull aid from you ... but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people from\nBut you need to embrace free markets\nYou need to you need to do something is\nBy the way he's also we when we talked about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunter and flag\nAnd all that and so people start question why do you want to come here\nDo you want to come here to become citizens or suggest to work and then it'll go back and then we have to have that discussion\nAs to well what do we want from people who come over here as\nCitizens but first before you even get to any of those other things that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only one side\nHas said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keep quiet on it well silence is your consent yes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in the United states so why are you preaching that\nNow that stuck was shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat who are well to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage\nOr isn't a crazy Democrat or a says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure in fact the constituency the votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of\nIllegal immigration and illegal immigration is a demographic that wants the least legal immigration into this\nCountry look you have a sanctuary city policies sanctuary state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice\nProtest\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders\nThey should say\nThey should be forced to say it\nBecause that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback if they're promoting border enforcement at any level\nI mean the from the party that is actually saying that and promote\nAnd I mean the from the party that is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi\nOr they promoting that may be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe Claire McCaskill [laughter] you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats but where's the party saying this is what\nWe want\nBecause that's the official what political battle how can we ever how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won officially tell us what they would ... what they want right\nExcept for those that are in the party that promote open borders\nThe elimination advice they won't even have the debate why right\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role of doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming ... is the question eight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nI radio show dot com the red eye radio million

initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar and appearance and bore the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida the packages were address to George Soros Hillary Clinton\nA former president Brock Obama former CIA director John Brennan a carriage CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible that additional packages were mailed to other locations\nUh this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have been formation to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News of the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a\nSuspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement that the Capitol police have told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central mail facility was backing away to death for

five and ... and it's earlier statement\nThe LA police department tweeted that its bomb squad had rendered the package at the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so

saying is that the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying that both were harmless right they're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about\nThe suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way right on that one so uh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you saw from CNN you saw it from\nThe the the Democrats\nAre you know we're picking where well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts but she didn't

hours which we found really interesting for a Senate race to be the main accusation and an ad that clearly is a\nDesperation ad yeah they'd be big arches why not that he drinks why why he purchased

real people but that's not what they did here they're trying to portray real people to the sentiment of people\nUm and\nThey probably couldn't find it pretty\nMuch as I said it at all I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that ad uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday that the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly out because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it is something we we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats\nTo help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice\nHere's Ian just interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person on the street and said what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um you know it's it it really is about the president's I guess in the state of the industry of the particular industry right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states\nIt even if you're not a farmer um ... yeah right now you know you might you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that state even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts that they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah\nWhich you know I Will see if if that point works out or if any of this works er here within two weeks\nIt's\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it it that positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say it she approve this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters\nShe's referring to her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the main stream high ranking members of the party\nThat she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the positioning here that board is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know ... you know with my my party in it no saw approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation and say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put\nThat ad right where the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Eric has what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah exactly what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that ... they're they're they're looking at holiday because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats ... but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical ... extreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot and it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will\nWell not yet a extreme cause extreme if something is is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah\nBut this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing\nIs that it doesn't matter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter that\nYou're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate or that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple of times\nIt's because of their actions\nAnd and we said this a few weeks ago their actions go outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races\nAnd other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we have\nSo that's the effect is is that come out one Harris or or I was with Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and those people in the ...\nThe state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with\nAt some point a Kamala Harris or you know as a side with as you're crazy Democrats she ... she just did as having us [laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote that but\nWhere does she go on this well she made a choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side he goes to the other if she loses Democrats then that doesn't matter of the people in the middle are going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she condones that behavioral\nLenny we saw it during the cop Kavanaugh process and and that's my I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people have when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho's looked at the cabinet thing and so they're crazy I mean they're ... they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back ... that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right but\nYou actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the lame the way you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and\nWith that vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning their behavior\nIs not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yup coming to that conclusion just have it all just prove that eight six six Ninety
