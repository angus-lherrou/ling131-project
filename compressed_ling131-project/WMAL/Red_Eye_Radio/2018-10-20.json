Chrysler suit with Iranian [noise] it\nCertainly is red eye radio and a smart guy so back with you again [noise] I was with you in September for weekend as I said it's free to be back with you again I had a great time talking with you the last couple of days and I look forward to the next two days and very interested in fact with your Sunday night Monday morning\nI could easily get use to filling in for them especially because you've been so gracious to me and you're kind comments about my work and you can keep in touch with me and see where I Am on the air next on my Web page at ... dot com where you can email me following me on Facebook or Twitter or leave me a message with a question or comment that I can respond to\nAfter this week I'll next beyond October twenty ninth on another show but ... again check that out on my Web page there are a number of topics I said I Would get to tonight's I Want to keep my word for someone to talk to you about illegal immigration\nI've been talking about this for over ten years now in the air doesn't mean I didn't think about this Twenty years ago and so on but I never wavered in my position the issue and you guys were bringing up the last few days so I thought I Would focus on on the first segment at least and see your response\nThe issue is really not that difficult if you'd knowledge the simple fact that people who cross the border illegally have come here legally which is why those on the other side do not want to call them illegal immigrants let alone it illegal aliens one of the college last night said you know markets legal aliens forget it\nSo you have the term document an undocumented immigrants as if the only problem is they don't have documents as if they miss place them somewhere or loss them\nBecause if you acknowledge their coming here illegally the argument might be quickly over if they are legal they're not allowed to be here and the story and and another caller said that why you know why is this going on is pretty simple\nSo it was an example if you own a home and someone tries to enter without your permission you would call the police to make sure they didn't get to go in they wouldn't be able to say they want to draw home to go into your home but they just lack the proper documents\nSimilarly if someone walks in tears to your bank and wants to take the money out of your account right\nThey were to be asked to prove that it's their account\nIf they said it was their account but they just tend to have the documents to prove it the bank would not permit them access it's not obvious\nWhich is why you just so ludicrous for the left to use the phrase undocumented as this that can have your house and bank account if only they could find the misplaced documents for years now I've said the left is one of the argument over language\nBut how about they not be allowed to come or in the first place and we wouldn't need to care if they cooperated with authorities isn't that obvious how can you ever justify harboring criminals who commit crimes that native born Americans have no asylum from you change the debate watch this to the evil police officers at ice who\nHave the audacity to arrest people commit crimes that said these guys are really clever on the left so the rest of us live with long lines at hospitals through reading schools and intolerable traffic while the elites often live behind walls and their gated communities so what's my solution\nYou take away the benefits like free health care and free schools you enforce strict penalties against businesses that hire illegals even sending some CEO to jail you say in the first CEO to jail for hiring and illegal immigrant and it'll never happen again\nAnd you'd be amazed at how many illegal immigrants would return home run he actually had a right to use the wrong language self deport there we go again with language right we're not good at that self deport we keep losing the language war to the left\nBut I Would then say that those who remained right everybody would leave it there are no bad if I take him back not everybody a lot would leave and that's what's happened during the recession a lot we leave there are no benefits no government handouts and they couldn't get jobs legally\nWe but I Would say that those who remain that's the point I Want to make I'd be willing to have a conversation about with them because they be saying for the right reasons\nAnd for heaven's sake enough of the government sending out the wrong message message with actions like the legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents a country is United by ...\nThat message with actions like legal education classes I'm a teacher I Know or bilingual government documents\nA country is United by language and it's shared values English is our language and immigrants need to learn the language our history and our shared values our ancestors kiss the ground when they landed here at Alice island they were so happy to have landed\nAt the land of freedom so let's build that wall and do everything to end dilute legal immigration and take our country back\nTell me what you think an

N. A. L. Washington comes to talk\nWith mark\nI'm back with you again calls and e six six Ninety ... we're talking about illegal immigration\nAnd let's see what Fred in Washington DC has to say about it for it [noise]\nHey [noise] well\nI'm a language that you talk about one of the biggest glaring things is that you even do it yourself and I used to do it but I'll marry you say American would actually we are us citizens in America and\nThe liberals are not a liberal that's called radicals ... they actually have taken that word in a plot it to everyone on the side of this so when they when they're talking American\nYou know we think that it's just sitting here no there are thinking the whole this whole side of the world and immigration means nothing to them sent me this is just normal stuff we have the same grain wars when we say American then they they say American safe brainwashed us\nTo think\nThat we're saying citizens and they and they are brainwashed us to think that\nEverybody uses American but when you look at your passport if you have won it says US citizen that's what we are\nA huge difference we have to be so deliberate with what we say words have got to be delivered and that's that's got to be all the main thing that we have to do even on the air because the the radicals or taking those words and\nThat's what I say\nWell I appreciate your call but I'm not going to give up that word tonight I just refuse to do it\nI eat when I hear that word America or Americans have it be you know all kinds of patriotism comes to my mind I'm not going to let them use or that and just because they think America's you know north Americans or whatever they want to use it for not going to let them get away with that\nOh and you know some of the songs right America the beautiful let that that's not there's I'm not conceding that to them there's not a chance I'm going to do that\nAgain I don't want to concede the language them at all that's why it's important to illegal immigrants and illegal aliens I Know people kept me on that\nUm but I don't I don't see anything to them and and if you do that and then you're kind of given up a little bit no where Americans we passed for United States citizens great I get it\nBut there's something special about this country called America where the United states of America America usa whenever you want to call it\nAnd so appreciate your call that's my take on it and now you're national forecast for cobra electronics\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and in fact Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots are showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nWas one of the enduring things who needed the abuse of his family right and and now you know if the Democrats getting power that's another thing I mentioned this last couple of days I think in power not only hearings and subpoenas but you know they're going to go after taxes\n'cause they're they're sure they're going to find something there that though I'll probably with the Russians I guess right he made some kind of deal the Russians but even if they don't what business is it um there's\nWhat his tax returns are it's just not that their business I Know certain presidents have done I I don't think they should\nIt's it's no one's business what you pay in taxes that that should be a private thing it's none of your business Democrats or Republicans I don't I wouldn't want them to know my I don't I pay what I'm supposed to pay him do my share but if anybody else's business by the way after Kevin hearings and all this other stuff if they go after his taxes\nWhy to good people exactly why do people want to serve\nA pet especially people that states why and that leads me to another point I think we should consider Democrats loves serving in government of course for them they believe in much more government so here they get a chance\nTo do that they get a chance to maybe be a bureaucrat and tell you how to live your life\nYeah they're the ... party that loves to work in government were in the party that has to give something up I think it was Daniel Boone who served for a little while and Congress and you know he he was one of those that hey I Can't wait to get home\nIn the case of Republicans and conservatives I think they are much more likely to say I want to go back to my family and to my life because they don't believe in this whole part and that's what illegals don't know\nWhat makes America special one of the big things he's limited government that government stays out of your lives and don't you find it ironic to say the least\nThat a lot of illegals who come to our country are escaping corruption in government and big government\nAnd what they do when they get here they vote for exactly the same thing they left it's really bad\nSo the you because it it takes a while like a lot of people said yesterday people don't know what's going on right when they do the those man on the street interviews woman on the street interviews and you know they say who's the vice president United States they can't name that that's not so important\nWhat's important is that they know what makes this country special what makes this country except at all\nThat we leave the citizens alone we let them live their lives so I teach my students I get\nAnd I don't try to indoctrinate them I give them both sides I get why we need traffic lights if we don't have traffic lights your going to have anarchy\nBut on every issue you bring before me I Want the government out of my life as much as possible\nThat's why some people question is why I'm conservatives like a government when it comes to things they can't do themselves that would explain a strong military\nI Can't have a tank in my backyard or grenades or is let alone nuclear weapons so there are evil people in the world right that that's another thing that shows this debate in perspective with the illegal immigration they want to open borders on the other side because they think well mostly people are pretty good I I don't believe that\nI Believe people will have a real tendency to be bad and they do awful things like a lynching right like the Germans were out of the strongest tribe and the Eighteenth century and when asked why they did what they did this because we can I I don't trust humanity I I don't trust that\nAnd there was something special about this country where we didn't want to trust government and I didn't get into this so much last night's caller mentioned that\nWe have a system of checks and balances the founders were brilliant\nSo there are laws the federal government does their laws right that the states are in charge of\nAnd the rest is left to the people they did that on purpose but even there right how do you pass a law you guys know this the house has to pass the Senate has to concur and then the president has to agree if he doesn't agree he vetoes it and then the house and Senate could override it\nAnd then the Supreme Court could say you pass a law that's unconstitutional they really were afraid of big government\nSo that's another big issue with illegal immigrants they don't understand what makes this country so special\nBut most you guys do and even if you're on the left I Want you to explain to me while I'm wrong about illegal immigration gave me a call at eight six six Ninety red eye that's eight six six nine or seven thirty three thirty nine I'm Mark ...

I don't know if we'll get to it about what your relatives and friends think of you if you're on the conservative side of you still get to keep them\nBut I Do have inside in Texas I I think Cruz is going to win I don't think there's any doubt about that the numbers seem to be showing that he's pulling away I think that's their fool's gold like it was for Republicans in Pennsylvania for the longest time although we finally won at\nFlorida is more problematic you're correct my hand the numbers the numbers I saw a little while ago showed that\nUh we could be were behind in the governor's race the senatorial race is is also we if he so that'll depending on who turns out you're absolutely right and how many are illegal votes they can get from people outside of the country on the Democrats' side\nBut you know I think we're starting to come back in the Senate I'm more worried about the house I Am about the Senate\nI think we're good friends individual yeah go ahead\nNo I was going to say I'm concerned about to have to I don't know what the ... congressional um situation is and I'm In you know Florida or Texas but um I don't understand you know I also don't understand why\nThe money when you know the\nPoliticians and they they talk why don't they appeal to the Democrats who live in those states I mean the Democrats are doing very well\nIn those states and you don't they understand that they're going to have a ten percent tax if the governor's race one by the Democrats in Florida and\nHe wants to do a lot of radical things and not as that gentleman a couple of callers ago that you know the states are\nThey can do a lot of things they can do I'm a single payer health care they can do a lot of things on their own um as an individual state and I don't understand why Democrats don't\nYou don't understand that for their own their own them being down there I just don't understand it and why are not the politicians including Democrat to invest and and you know be\nTrying to appeal to them\nYou mean Republicans will ... the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand it as I've been saying\nYou mean Republicans well the answer is people just don't follow it that much and they don't understand that as I've been saying tonight it it's very hard to explain the conservative and Republican position especially when the Democrats it's much more emotional you know hope and change\n'em a woman's right to choose whatever phrase they use live livable wage these things are on the surface if you don't explored\nThey oh that sounds like a pretty good idea yeah or equal pay for women have they have no idea the background that they're talking about a term but the same job necessarily\nA and that it wouldn't make sense for business too if they could get paying women less why they wouldn't have all women so a lot of leftist than liberal positions are defeated will but it takes a while to explain and you have to understand more so the answer your question is\nWhy do people vote to pay more taxes themselves many times they don't understand and the Democrats love hiding that anyway\nJust like now they they don't want to talk about that they really want to impeach the president Nancy Pelosi even said oh we're not going to talk about that now because they know that I think the overwhelming majority American people did not want to go through impeachment again I was wrong I was for it with Bill Clinton and what happened you won reelection\nUm people's ... American people basically don't want to go through that and that's where the Democrats by the way overplay their hand with Kevin Oh I think even people who are not conservatives looked at that hearing saying wait a second that was really ugly that was really unfortunate what they did a gentleman whether she was telling the truth or not in terms of what she believes leads leaving that aside\nThey treated him some badly the American people tend to be very fair and and\nSo they are the Democrats have to hide that they want to raise taxes when Dukakis by the wave announced that he didn't want to raise taxes the last big time\nSo let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye and we'll take your calls on legal immigration or anything else that you want to talk about but right now is your national forecast or video roads blocked\nAn area of low pressure will be moving out of Canada into the great lake region today and that'll provide some showers for Chicago at least for the early morning hours\nDetroit so you can look for showers throughout the day and then in the region and facts Monday for the entire eastern half of the U.S we'll look to be rained free but today a few more spots are showers mainly in the Ohio River valley that will extend it into the mid Atlantic region\nSo you you mean well and you pass something and then people figure out how to take advantage oh I Would do the same thing by lived a say in Asia and the thing I could get my kid to have American citizenship if they're just born here well I'm going to time my trip so that I have the baby now of course that could go wrong if babies late I guess very late\nBut then they figure out how to take advantage of your gun laws that that happens a lot let's go to a\nJeremiah Wright speaking of fraud Jeremiah in Nashville or Jeremiah owners mark\nYes sir hey I'm your on your mark they don't well great I'm well\nI'm I recently had a had a relationship um she got pregnant three weeks into the marriage um she's an illegal immigrant um she got pregnant\nUm well I wanted to make sure that everything was okay we got married uh got married and then\nShe ... she left she's gone\nAnd it's the fast track to a green card now the way they have you ever heard of the way they act and I'm just not touching up from what the previous the previous speaker was talking about um you know people don't know about this a whole lot um they don't know about the fact that you can come here\nIllegally have a have a\nYou know get pregnant and then just totally disregard everything\nAnd then live off the government um you can't get deported you can't um\nYou know all that I don't know if you've ever no I don't know if you've ever heard about anything like that but I just wanted to I wanted to share with the people 'cause man this this is a few people come here all the time they they want to get married they want to get pregnant and then\nThey want to just stay here and and uh it\nIt it's an amazing thing about I'm going my life has been turned upside down it's it's been an amazing experience I'm I'm having to live with it you know with a lawyer ... everything\nI guess you don't you you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders\nAnd I guess you don't ... you don't see your child then\nNo no um they do restraining orders I'm under the way the actors the women against violence I'm ... I'm\nSo if you come here and you charge somebody with with anything um you are here it's the bat tractor green card and\n... and you know um I Would probably I'll run out of time this week but I was going to have someone on talking about father's rights and what happens is the court system in in the family court so that just a total disaster let's go to a Georgian Huntsville, Alabama Georgia Iran with mark\nAnd mark I keep hearing these wonderful term thrown around that I think our mainstream media has created and every once in a latch don't do but I think it's also a misnomer we do not have an illegal immigration we haven't in Beijing going out\nThese are not undocumented immigrants they're invaders from foreign countries and we're being invaded by the failures of these other ...\nNo you're right no argument there yeah\nThere was any if it was their military doing it we\nWould be returning fire why are we sitting here so complacent late allowing this to happen this is absurd\nIt is absurd and that happens because there are people on the other side of have an agenda they don't believe in borders they don't believe there's anything special about the United states of America Says that the United states\nThey just see it differently than we do and they they want to fulfill their agenda that's what you're up against him President Trump was smart enough to make that his top issue and it's not at least one of his top issues and the American people responded\nAnd I think they did it correctly let's go to ah there's so many good calls here and let's go to Stan in while loosing Pennsylvania I probably missed that ups than Iran with mark\nOn your mark a great call you know you're got a great program there I really appreciate it I'm actually a Jersey\nIn who's visiting here and so I'm a escaped enemy territory for a while\nAnd I hope we can get ... out of their\nUh God but er I was calling basically uh uh I guess illegal voting I Know where he heard something on the on the radio a while back about Clinton and the DNC and how they were taking busloads of people\nIllegals not only voting for bringing them into other states to vote in other states\nAnd it was like really absurd\nAnd I was sick and I'm happy to stop that [noise] and if you remember like during the ah with when we were setting up governments who are in Afghanistan or Iraq after the war is [noise] they were taking people who are voting and dying their ... you know their thumb purple\nYou know they wouldn't vote more than once\nAnd I would say like if we could do that overseas why couldn't we do that here so we wouldn't have known not only illegals but people voting more than once and and uh [noise] you know disenfranchising other people's vote [noise] and uh\nBut you you you know the whole controversy over voter id that the other side had money doesn't want any part of voter id like that's a big crime to ask someone to yeah you are and let me see if you are who you say you are\nSo you're not committing voter fraud or voting illegal but you know that oh we're being races were being this you know how could you do that yeah I don't know by the way my position is different than most people I don't want people to vote unless they care enough to put some for some effort\nI'm worried about the people who voted don't know that much or or get to vote on the same day voting right and all that kind of stuff\nThat that was the other thing I was thinking also about uh like you said the voter id they make such a big gripe about how difficult it is and I was saying you know well how about on election day when somebody goes in to vote\nAnd you know you have to sign if you voted before you know they compare your signature and everything like that and while you're there voting or wherever they just take your picture\nAnd start the process of creating a voter id then you're already there it's not like you had to go someplace to you know to get a voter id you're already there so they take a picture of person and say you a digital camera you feed it into facial recognition\nThing in the tri state area and see if that per person pops up in another war or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could check and check and see if they voted\nAnother war or district or state on the same day and you know like you said a digital camera you could chicken chicken see if they voted previously on that day\nAnd age but at the same time he could be starting of voter id for you know they sign it you got the picture you do that you have their address and you know we have to fill out the card in a week or so you know\nYou go back and you bring to the id to them mail it to them [noise]\nAnd uh but at least should be able to compare because you have a photo of them [noise]\nTo see if they're voting and more than one place if they're registered more than one place and it well\nThere are two problems okay first the other side does it they want voted for ... sake he was up so often when we I Know that do but there's another point that bet you didn't think of\nI don't know that your state but in California have you ever seen the people who work the polls I don't think they can handle something as complicated as taking pictures\nOr they can't even find my name is the time but Pennsylvania or I wouldn't know originally you know I'm right right so you're going to people who are you oh Martha and that's when you go over to that table you're in the wrong place if they can't even figure it out\nAnd if I ever wants to marry and vision provisional ballot yeah it is scary so if you had to also give them cameras to take the picture\nI don't think so but you have to stand you have a selected ideas but they're not going to work have agreed evening\nOr tell you one one thing I did have their women to vote one time it was a primary and um I had a I asked them if I can have you know a a write in ballot\nRight and uh\nAnd he said oh yeah yeah you you can never write in doubt I walked in there and it wouldn't take it\nAnd of course and it was like totally amazing you know what's going on and he said well uh [noise] oh oh you know you're a you want to vote Republican\nHe goes uh or or Democrat I couldn't vote or they wouldn't let me do or writing ballot and I says well you said I could see says oh no you have to tell us before you go into the booth whether you want to write in ballots are not\nRight yeah I I I thought it was I thought it was gonna be worse I thought it was gonna say you can only a write in on the Democrats like you can't run and if you're a Republican and why my laughing voter fraud happens all the time let me know what you think eight six six Ninety red eye eight six six or seven thirty three

[laughter] I\nWell I I don't want to argue that you may be right but my understanding is if their child is born here that's why they're called an anchor baby and those anchor babies are American citizens\nWell that's a lefty a propaganda that once you to think that way that the ... the parent has to be on the sovereignty of the American government and gets to give you another example\nI can imagine ... says saying does analytics many many decades in another country and has children their children aren't automatically ... could they have to have some kind of lengths that residents say in the Knight state before they hand you have to\nBut that's not true Frank or babies they don't have to they don't have the parents don't have to have a ... as you say you know find the citizens of sovereignty\nAnd ... and the color of skin let us know if we're wrong uh but that's not my understanding that if if they're born here and that's why you see the people come here all the time we talked about that a pregnancy in the hospital and people come here from other countries and tried to time and so the baby can be born here\nI I if I'm wrong call me at eight six six Ninety red Iowa I Want to
