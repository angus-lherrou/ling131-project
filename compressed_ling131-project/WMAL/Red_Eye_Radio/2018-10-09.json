Thursday socialists his ... at the whole thing is that you know he's a he's he really is a lot of overtime you'll get paid for it but a lot of overtime\nHour um and we we look at that and but when you read the discussions over the discussions changed drastically and those reports from the national Hurricane Center on Monday morning and they started to show signs of that and that uh Michael strengthening\nA and having potential to strengthen greatly late Sunday and Monday morning but then they sought there's apparently a sheer that's involved here that they said typically\nWould mean that it's not going to be such a powerful storm but they said despite that chair and I I read the ten pm central discussion on and it said it defies all logic that the sheer is still in place\nUh this this element essentially that would diminish the strength or keep the strength from growing I guess\nI'm despite that\nAnd they think maybe it's because of the size of the I thirty five miles by\nA it is it is showing great potential for strengthening so for our friends there\nUh in in the Gulf Coast and on the panhandle for to listen to the authorities listen uh to keep your radios on uh make sure you were up to date on the information because this storm\nAgain has the potential to be and most are calling it now or that they're saying there's a likelihood of a a major hurricane hitting the

... and then\nIn you're never going to pass the Senate you need two thirds mhm so it would never patch it's never happened in the history of the country so it's not going to happen so why are you

on MSNBC oh that's very interesting you didn't setting and interesting yeah if I knew what it meant it would be more interesting yeah that's it is that uh you know just kind of\nLook ... if you look if you go back to the history\nOf ah of Brock Obama's political career who he was as a political operative and and there was a lot of jokes made about community organizer right\nBut the community organizer especially in the Chicago area oh look I mean in a number of things but politically it means getting people to the polls that's actually what it means a you know for politically or for any area\nNot just Chicago but getting people to the polls\nThey they what they did is they grew that they nurtured that and they owned that better than the Republicans in fact the Republicans didn't know how to do it and two thousand eight\nAnd in two thousand twelve they beat Romney's team Romney was if you do and I were following the post debate polls be the polls that happened right after the debates between Mitt Romney\nAnd Barack Obama President Obama at that time\nAnd the polls showed that Mitt Romney or on the issues landslide numbers even the exit polls yes and so massive massive numbers the difference was the organization that's what happened in twenty sixteen\nThey are and she had been working in the DNC than see this because they were busy with you know the whole fusion GPS and you know Christopher Steele Russians and all that uh but they are and see where they were putting their efforts was much like they in fact\nUh some say that as they designed it\nAh after that model of getting people to the polls that's what it's all about you can call it what you want but at the end of the day it is getting people to get out and vote\nAnd that's what happened with those states that that Trump ended up winning that nobody saw\nAnd it was that you know boots on the ground type you know community organizing\nThe organization that she's trying to speak on it it really doesn't apply internally I mean\nWhipping the votes is one thing\nThat Democrats do have had a playbook for a long long time and will long after\nA Casio Cortez is gone you and I kind of touched on the other day of kind of dismissing things being able to turn their head on a a Joe mansion you know and and not you know the look the other way with an Joe mansion in certain cases and and not really worry about things like that\nWhen they can they know they can use Joe mansion for other things so\n[noise] the\nThe entire equation is not going to change in fact\nI don't think the Democrats are the party would wanted to change because on many issues\nAh they'll do what they have done in the past which includes the kind of behavior we saw with Obamacare we need to pass it so you can see what's in it which includes lying to the American people about what's what it's going to do\nWell and she was saying that we need to organize for the pressure's not within a you know the the the body which would mean the pressure doesn't come from you know well whipping up the votes that the pressure comes from the outside electorate will that happens all the time I don't I mean that that ... that that stating a are nothing new the other thing is when\nNow you have the excuses no she's not a leader of the party she's not a leader of the party you well you may not believe that she is and she isn't right now but the mainstream media believes that she is that's why she\nBelieve that she is and she isn't right now but the mainstream media believes that she is that's why she gets on President did television time from the mainstream media\nAs a a candidate for Congress ... who has one nothing yet who was a bartender a year ago\nThey said you know they basically if it was the leader of the DNC is basically said she's the ... she's the future right I mean she may not she's not the leader of the party right now\nBut she's the future that's what that's what the media is going to turn to the reason the media turns to that is because\nThey see what's going on with the left by the way you know from the outside in who who's leading the Democrats right now and has been leading the Democrats what force what movement is leading the Democrats while its its overall if you were to term it\nCollectively it's the protester\nIt's the extreme left but what's the problem with that is that how many\nDifferent protests are they're the reason right now that they can dismiss someone tomorrow and they are a Beto O'Rourke does not need a a former president Barack Obama to campaign for I'm In Texas\nThey're so over you and it doesn't matter who you are\nOr you admitted though you know it's going to happen if\nIf for clues as Obama's going to come out and say you should abused by endorsement well that's what you have a party will say he ... he reached my endorsement gas shouldn't be rejecting right Obama's a endorsement but really I mean I'm I'm Glad you brought that up because that's something else from last week\nThat we really didn't get a chance to talk about but really that's unbelievable it shows you you know you and I you and I started working together Thirteen Years ago so you know we were we were together or three years when Obama first got elected right and and we remember every single moment of it and we remember\nThe the political I dollar tree that for president or an Obama remember his you know the the DNC speech from when they when they did it from the stadium with Greek columns and everything else and people were falling over him and it was\nAnd I'll look at it today now out of it now I ... yeah our our goal is to have\nThe liberal takeover of a of a of Texas A M bathe or work nah we don't want to ... years after he's out now we don't want him why he made the\nBecause and and that's it what what a Casio courthouse doesn't include here is internally externally the political pressure by the way it always comes from the outside\nUh that's of course it does and and it's always the people on it like we said yesterday about Republicans if if\nThe Republicans were jailed last year or as the president took office in January of twenty Seventeen like uh they are now after capital then we probably would see if they were jailed on the issue of health care we would see Obamacare gone completely\nBut that wasn't the case and so that that there is one example of political pressure being a president in in in one ear and then gone and the next\nWell with the left the\nProblem is is your political pressures coming from every different splinter group right it which moves in multiple directions tell me which direction you go when are you going to be with the feminists are the trends genders\nBecause you can't on their boat right now they're fighting with each other as we predicted right three or four years and and so that's the problem that they created they they basically over a couple of generations they were out a ... and indoctrinate in children and and and\nYoung people to believe that it was that it's right to wake up today and find a new oppressor\nFind a new reason to be a victim and that might include somebody with that was with you and part of your group yesterday [noise]\nPresident Obama or just not really into any more\nThat I mean I just wanted was speaking engagements and that but that Iran take our thinking about it shows\nYou how the political wins yes Ken Ken just blow the one of the probably the biggest political idol of my lifetime\nAnd make it so he's not even relevant two years after he's out of office yeah ... years are running right from him saying that don't need an don't need his endorsement here\nAnd that's because and and you and I've talked about we thought this might happen because we saw some of the science because the less believes he truly was into liberal right that he truly he was he wasn't in it really for the cause\nHe was and it just because of the gig\nRight but he really wasn't in to doing what needed to be done to move the political lover\nIt was and it just because of the gig\nRight but he really wasn't\nIn to doing what needed to be done to move the political lover as far left as they thought he did and worked with his own party as closely as as many thought he was going to eight six six Ninety right I\nWas very much about rose and

just there on the coastline but of course in one although down to you have the ... flood surge yeah so uh there's going to be obviously that affect\nA flooding uh extremely dangerous uh this this no doubt will be the one of those storms that is an is right now they they know is that comes ashore in his life threatening as a life threatening storm you need to pay attention to the details and and the warnings and he'd those warnings\nAre and those calls by officials are as as they issue those calls over the next a few days\nAnd then we what we watch Michael then and evidently become a tropical storm\nA and then move back out over water later this week cold or a cold water and and and that's the good news at will steal the power from that storm but\nNot before doing damage a not for Michael

investigation of ...\nNot an investigation the investigation may happen but it's not going to be an impeachment there's there's the thing is it's the promise\nUltimately what that you will remove him

question when you start moving in that direction how did you move in that direction and go through the entire process without learning who leaked to\nThe media is not going to tell you because they don't have to reveal their source\nBut the investigation if you look at an investigation where would go and it will be public\nI mean there's nothing here in terms of classified material that is going to be in place this will be a very public investigation how do you do that without\nRevealing who leaked it\nAnd we know who leaked it\nSo the problem is they don't want that on record the Democrats who leaked it don't want it on record\nBecause that has to be a part of the process\nAnd just below sea as she said she really want to see the second background check from the FBI ... by the way you had a bunch of Republicans who saw it and said release it release it release it and they do it because they don't want to break protocol for the next judge right\nBy the Republicans were saying we wish we could release this thing yeah it's an empty ... this was an empty promise that isn't going to happen um they can hold their investigation they can call for the investigation they can hold their investigation but a complete investigation must include who leaked it to the media\nEight six six Ninety red eye looking to purchase your own trucker trailer exile financial company may be able

I guess I guess the point that I'm asking is\nIs it in it and is\nThe Republicans are the majority one and the Democrats you that's that's my point why is that there was there to be a bright go to ... to me that's what I mean it's bad for Democrats or what is their issue that they can use their\nYeah this is so dumb that doesn't well it doesn't have a mandate attached to it and the oil companies don't\nCare about the credits [noise] they don't care about the credits\nThat's not something that helps them if the government forces a mandate and that's what was being proposed the even President Trump has talked about the past raising the mandate right to ... percent right well if you do that that becomes a that becomes a big problem politically ... outside of Iowa\nCould I just I've read like three different articles on it and that's what I thought it was was okay you're trying to please both sides but you're not really pleased anybody well because you're not mandating it the oil companies aren't going to do it right it's not a mandate on it so you're simply saying I'm\nGoing to allow them I'm going to allow I'm going to allow the industry to do what the industry doesn't wish to do right and sell it year round well I think you're probably going to see push back\n... first of all I guess we'd have to see what the participation rate is ... ... the largest cities like Houston in LA they don't want more smog what\nGas stations going to be the first to put want to put a Fifteen in when you know as well as I Do on the Internet is going to be fine you can damage your car you know of of a fast or you can damage your lawn mower faster if you use e Fifteen mhm\nRight that it should just be ten percent should be the max and putting Fifteen Percent is is just ridiculous so nobody's going to do it\nSo it was just the way the president's just trying to appease people without doing anything\nIt's trying to appease the farmers\nBut you can't get there from here because there is no great motivator there really is no incentive even with changing how the credits work\nEven with changing because changing it to sell it year round\nHow does that bent the benefits those that are blending at well okay you could blend it year round and you wouldn't have to change up at the refinery level as often that is not that's not promising to them because ultimately it automatically comes back down to the consumer right\nSo the mandate is on the blend here's my question if the mandate is on the ... right at ten percent but the mandate isn't there for Fifteen Percent\nBut those companies the the the the oil companies that are putting out let's say they responded to the incentive of of changing the credits\nAnd we went to I don't know sixty Seventy percent of the ethanol or the gasoline so would would have a Fifteen Percent\nOr ethanol content on the market what would happen with the consumer\nOf the consumers will be driven to look for the ten percent seek out the temp right when that happens and you have a glut of the eight Fifteen on the market then what happens then there's pushback from the retail is that's why the retailers don't want her to have the time this is why it is destined to fail\nYou're handing you believe you're handing something to the farmers and the corn states but it really doesn't fly without the mandate\nIf you believe you're handing something to the farmers and the corn states but it really doesn't fly without the mandate and he knows politically outside of Iowa you can't get any Fifteen mandate done right now\nYou can't\nI mean you might get Chuck ... on board [laughter] to help your choice [laughter] I mean he's a farmer himself [laughter] so [laughter]\nWait a minute [laughter] days only trying to scratch\nGrass leaves me back [laughter] that's right you don't even I everybody's paying all thank you all just now where I met you I didn't even think about that I mentioned earlier the leaders are already tomorrow yeah as a ... [laughter]\nSorry Mr Trump we didn't do start that story for you but ah I just I mean I when I read it I'm thinking well this doesn't do anything and you're just ... it's the eight Fifteen that is banned in the summer months um they do have a Fifteen out there there is some out there but as it is not is not mandated\nWell the the question is is that if the city's believe like Los Angeles\nOr states like California\nWho through the California air resources board I could see them coming in because you know a Houston and in Los Angeles compete for the number one ah a spot in terms of the smoggy is city\nOr they don't want the eight Fifteen on the market they're not gonna wants to eat Fifteen on the market which is an interesting position to be [laughter] they can blame Al Gore by the way for this this whole thing um but the [laughter] a part but the\nThe problem is ultimately they won't want more smog they don't they will try and I'm or could try and move way ahead of it even if they don't believe it's gonna fly they would probably want to get ahead of it legally by going after the EPA or if\nThe rule or exemption is but here's here's the difference ... is president going to

Grassley [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nBut they're not mandating that you buy Fifteen Percent while making it available where you could do it year round well there even though I don't I I don't expect anyone\nTo sell something when it's going to be promoted instantaneously if it comes to fruition after tomorrow and you're going to see it bombarded all over the Internet all the

remembered that said the Trump Administration was complicit in right in the in Hurricane Florence mhm uh you know we talked about you know the rest of the president\nDoing something on that but all we're really not sure but\nAllowing the the the increase to happen initially ethanol was supposed to be about reducing global warming until they found out from farm to tank it actually produces more global warming gases\nBecause of what you have to do to actually make up and all and we just mentioned that the president doesn't even bring up global warming it says oh the government needs to\nBecause of what you have to do to actually make up and all and we just mentioned that the president doesn't even bring up global warming it says oh the government needs to uh get involved in this in order to help the farm play 'em\nAnd then we have the United nations coming out and saying we're doomed\n[noise]\nBecause of global warming that we are uh you have a\nAl Gore traveling the United nations as well but we have twelve more years yes we'd twelve years now I Know I Know you're we're already passed the first twelve years aren't we yeah yeah you ever was there but this twelve years they made it\nAnd so so how do we solve it well the United nations special climate reports suggest a tax on carbon dioxide admissions would be neat to be as high as twenty seven thousand dollars per ton at the\nEnd of the century to effectively limit global warming ... that means you would have to have a two hundred and forty dollar per gallon tax on gasoline in that year\nHuh now should such a recommendation be adopted yeah in twenty thirty the report says a carbon tax would need to be as high as Fifteen five hundred dollars that's the equivalent of forty nine dollars per gallon\nGas tax by twenty thirty well then the experts we'll be right cars won't be on the road to third day won't be anywhere\nThen they become what even more dependent on government\nAnd they quote home and Jenkins for the wall Street Journal here factoring in social economic demographics of the population on the Atlantic and Gulf Coast said Mr lumber damaged by future hurricanes will only increase because the population is greater and wealthier and there may be more deaths sane vulnerability is the main hurricane problem facing the United states\nWe should not allow so many houses to be built on flood plains or coastlines we should insist on higher building standards and increase wetlands\nTo handle flooding we should stop federal insurance subsidies that encourage building in vulnerable areas and mentioning that every new site in cable news channel will be promoting heroin and heroic stories about Hurricane Florence\nMr home and said major storms have become events they afford great footage which feeds a false sensation viewers and storms and become more frequent and more powerful meanwhile tragedies befall Americans every day for which the federal government does not shower them with they'd because CNN is not present\nHe might also have said connecting extreme weather to climate change to encourage carbon reduction is today's falls mantra declaring practical steps towards living rationally\nA A R possible he said they could begin with Congress quad defined for the American people how much they're fourteen over annually to entice fellow citizens to live near the beach uh\n[laughter] so [noise] um\nI just you know interesting the actual politics of it but you know and and we will probably you know hear it again after a hurricane Michael ... a again the blaming of President Trump oh sure and that's why like I said during limburg if you want to check out his stuff\nUh he writes some great articles and he does believe again or he believes global warming is happening he believes humans are partly responsible for it but he believes that what the left is doing is completely wrong but do we have an interest act interesting prospect yeah do we have an impact of course we have an impact\nBut we're part of this life cycle here on this planet yes I Do as people always ask what do you think and I said I don't own neither do you write and I don't think anybody

always wrong\nMhm well there are things that we could measure in the past that aren't necessarily part of the global warming thing but you ... the chocolate and in terms of pollution\nParticularly ... matter yeah you can you want yeah you can quantify these are things that we can measure and we can understand the problem is is when you see policy especially the cost of government which keeps creeping up\nA that is put on the American people are with out\nThat kind of of evidence and discussion I mean again pollution you can measure you can have the discussion there in fact I think the

or allow all\nGood morning guys our experience at All right\nWell one of the reasons they start incorporating ethanol or apple out all into the fuel was that they used to use what what's called MTV

for the farmers to increase the percentage of alcohol and the fuel bland\nHowever alcohol doesn't hold the same amount of energy right around him as gasoline does your do your mileage fuel mileage so which screwing up consumers ... doing\nYeah well we had no problem with the we we had no problem when we talked about this report without that all four of the anti knocking capabilities that's not what a temper send exists [laughter]\nNo but ... percent mandate existed initially for global warming right yeah waiting overlook we've not our problem is the fact that yeah it's great for the farmers will anything would be great if the government mandates that you must make something and the consumer must buy it it's always great for that industry to have that kind of monopoly a great government dictates\nAll right you need to do this for the well what's the reason Oprah global warming but what's the reason now to make sure you have a job ... book for video robot here's your

Hurricane Center forecast indicates Michael May be a category three hurricane with wins from\nBecause he said and we were at and what a couple of stories said it was Great Britain because of Christopher steals involvement in it but some of our allies did not want us to a release sitting there were a couple of other things that needed to go over so he was going to give it to the inspector general for further review\nNow we were initially for the first day little dumbfounded go couldn't understand why it was going to him\nAnd on the air this is going back ten or eleven days as you and I were discussing why were to go to the inspector general and all the sudden it was data that's\nThe role of the inspector general is to do what is to investigate corruption there it's the you don't give it to the inspector general to save review this and tell me what I can release and what I can uh you know what I can unwritten pact\nYou use that for that you use\nYour a director of national intelligence ear CIA director uh your your uh a secretary of state it was a former CIA director those are the people you would go to for the for for that maybe your national security director now but you know the secretary of defense those are the people you would go to\nIntroduce to decide at least in my opinion whether you should declassify it or not and I say you're a secretary of state former CIA director because they claim that some allies or didn't want some things to be released and our initial thing was wait a minute what are their allies no they don't know what's in their right how how do they know that the\nAnd we were initially puzzled when he said he was going to give it to ah the inspector General Michael Horowitz until we realize\nThey were they ... that it went whoa look at this\nBut yeah the conclusion we came to was that if you were looking if you're looking to give this to the inspector general of the department of justice then you're basically asking him to do an investigation and to issue a report they said they X but they asked for an expedited process here from Mr Horwitz\nAnd the only reason you do that is because of the role of a Michael Horowitz the inspector general's office in in the overall is to do what to look at possible fraud or misdeeds done within the ... of justice fraud or around during the ... and all of that\nWould be and if you think about it because I I'm thinking of a a a ... and in the room with the president and also or his chief of staff Kelly is well looking at that and saying\nIf you come out and make a conclusion or draw conclusion from this information or by de classifying it\nWe see the on redacted information here if we jumped to the conclusion well first of all the executive branch is not really that there is no prosecutorial\nPower there you would have to go through a ... that apartment of justice itself but where would you start at the department of justice if you believe that people that are either they're in place or were there before\nCommitted a you know a crime possibly or there was fraud or corruption or any of those items that would be on a plate of the inspector general's office for you would start with Michael Horowitz that's the only way because beyond that you're looking at just\nThat would be on the plate of the inspector general's office for you would start with Michael Horowitz that's the only way because beyond that you're looking at just a political move that's all the way it would be played it would be well the president saying this and that's not what we think if you take that off the out of the political arena\nAnd that's exactly what you do hear\nThink about the fact that you're not sending it to the attorney general even\nThat could be seen as a political move because he's an appointee\nBy the president right while our air supposed to be a ton of us and you know ... or which\nIs someone that's been in place since before he was appointed by Obama he was appointed by Obama but more importantly uh that's that's a key to opening the door and ending the discussion about whether it's politically motivated more importantly\nOn top of that you at the fact of\nWhat the inspector general was designed to do in the ... report you might see from the inspector general's office when we went through the inspector general's report ah on the FBI there were a number of things in the uh the Hillary email investigation a number of things there that we found now\nYou're taking this I guess otherwise mundane report and you're trying to basically build the narrative as to what was going on in this case of the other report of at the FBI under the direction of a then director James Comey\nAnd what was going on and and how the Hillary email investigation uh was handled into and then part late into the Russian investigation and all of that\nNow when you have here by the way I think that's part of it to\nYou already have an existing report that covers part of the timeline in fact uh the most important part of the timeline that would be outlined in potentially in this classified are now de classified information\nSo now Horowitz having already done the investigation\nOn the FBI and how they handled the Hillary email investigation and then the Russia investigation now has all of that work done the legwork done there to possibly lends support to this new investigation um and it's I think\nInteresting and I think very key that the president turned it over to Horwitz and basically washed his hands up and for now\nAnd I think it's important to remember Giuliani has been saying that he believes the perjury happen that right you had somebody in the FBI verify because that's his charge okay and and again we're this is going on speculation by what\nPeople who claimed are familiar with the matter a bully even and he is a former prosecutor what he believes is that he believes there is possible perjury in the fact that\nAh the Pfizer warrant and they're supporting documents with the Pfizer warned that they swore were intelligence when they were opposition research and when the when everything was a redacted excuse me on redacted\nWhen everything was opened up and declassified so everybody can see it\n... how they got the Pfizer warrant application the surrounding documents the three oh twos and the communications between the higher ups\nOf the FBI that somebody in the administration said don't release this Mr President because if you release this it'll be viewed as political you solve with Adam Schiff said Adam Schiff said well he's only partially released the what they want to really solve it\nNote if you believe that you see the corruption and that's what we believe they believe because you only give it to or which because you believe possible crimes have been committed ... either something extremely wrong or crimes have been committed\nAnd you give it to the inspector general because at that point he can come out with a complete report and not just use you know the the unwritten pact that evidence that you have but he can go look from anything he wants in the department of justice and get it to help build his case\nHe has access to the documents that the that the ... the oversight committee could not get from the FBI there is no process that stops Horowitz from walking in and obtaining those documents that the the those oversight committees have been trying to get for a long time\nHe has direct access to all of that information\nI Want to read or parts of this from John Solomon that adds to all of this he goes the department of justice and the FBI had tried to thwart President Trump on releasing evidence suggesting that will harm national security make allies less willing to cooperate or even leave him vulnerable to accusations\nThat he's trying to obstruct the end of the Russia probe before you judge the arguments from the department of justice and the FBI which are similar to those offered to stop the release of information another major episodes in American history from the bay of pigs to nine eleven consider or any ...\n... to stop the release of information on the other major episodes

things I've heard over the last couple of days especially from the left the legitimacy of the Supreme Court is now gone of course that's ridiculous right\nAh it it it isn't I mean that's the ... when when you're lost for anything else to say that's that's what you say the only other thing as I've said I Will not let it was yesterday showing and I and I do believe this is up to the Republicans need to work out and I said maybe I was nitpicking after Republicans were celebrating their victory but\nUh when I heard a Mitch McConnell afterwards being asked a question about conservative justices he even use the term conservative justice and I said look we need to as conservatives we need to take that out of it it's not conservative versus political on the Supreme\nCourt it's originalist versus liberal that's what it is if you want to be accurate as to what is actually going on it's the liberals who wish to put on judges who passed legislation\nVersus not conservatives who wish to pass conservative legislation it's originalist construction is also been they've been called\nBut originally ... who want to stick to the original text of the constitution\nAnd say it's not our job to legislate now that may be a conservative idea\nBut same liberal versus conservative justices gives you the indication that it's all political and it's not\nFrom the point of view of a conservative the kind of judge we want is one who will protect the constitution not to change it changing the constitution is up to a or changing the law or the constitution is up to the legislature or the constitutional amendment process\nAnd it's that simple and we need to as conservatives or we need to and libertarians we need to promote that\nThat it is we the people who are elected representatives they need to be making the law\nAnd not abandoning the constitution and having a judge's become legislators and we haven't explained that it up and so when I hear even in the media on a consistent basis in once in a while I'll even split\nAre they going to you besides impeachment you know what is ... you know what is the issue thinking about is there we went through and and even just just before we got to the cabinet nomination it was still the mall or investigation Trump illusion you and I I I remember ah the ah\nThe was it the the the Thursday or the ... the Thursday or friday when when Chuck Todd said you better not miss work tomorrow that had to be like what was\nThat ... right around Labor Day yeah it was the friday heading into Labor Day weekend and and that was because you know Mueller's going to let the investigation nobody's even talking about rushing collusion no it's not on anybody's radar it seems like that was\nTen years ago and that's how fast the the cycle has has moved you know what is on people's minds and so when I woke up yesterday I started thinking what are Democrats thinking the issue is what's the issue that they can go after\nIt's an issue that they can go after Trump out what's the issue that will even grab\nDemocrats right now to say oh yeah okay that's the issue you and I talked about the fact that the un coming out and saying OK it's time for our annual we're doomed to update because of global warming\nAnd we're thinking of the Democrat's gonna jump on that they've been jumping on that since the beginning of the Obama administration that and race on a consistent basis and so I was looking at you earlier and saying I'm waiting for the race baiting to start some time by the end of the week because it's been their old standbys is what they've always used to even though at the same time the American people have said we don't care\nYeah we don't believe those are the top pitches we don't believe race relations or the top issue we believe we get along with each other really well uh you folks in Washington may not and you people that belong to a certain groups\nOr or you know or or may not but for the most part we get along and global warming well you haven't made your case to the vast majority of America let me go get a burger is I mean seriously that's words that but you know and we ... we actually stay to during the Obama\nAdministration I'll never forget it where we said\nAre they doing this on purpose\nBecause I actually think that if we don't talk about the issues of the day if we don't talk about the economy because remember the economy and never had three percent growth the entire time of the Obama administration and you and I would talk about this all the time saying there seems to be no interest in talking about making the economy better\nNo it wasn't even a just a story that was being discussed\nAnd and they just went back to global warming and and race\nSo I really find it interesting as to as we are now just a little under a month from uh from election time to watch what's the Democrats issue what are they actually going to use besides impeachment if they think that's going to work which brings me to this article Wall Street journal Bobby Jindal\nFormer a former governor of of\nAh Louisiana two thousand two thousand six to eight Democrats try some self restraint now I I like Bobby Jindal but this may be a little bit delusional\n[laughter] it was just right [laughter] yeah\nUh it's not certain the Democrats just want to read the parts of it because I actually started laughing during it or it's not certain but that's okay he's trying to be an optimist mhm uh I'm being a complete and total sitting here at this moment but I think justifiable\nI can justify it it's not certain the Democrats will retake the house but if they do they will likely ignore\nTheir leaders preferences and push to impeach President Trump or perhaps justice capping off\nAnd the swap with Clinton era of positions Democrats now lecture the nation that unseemly personal behavior makes the president unfit for office while Republicans and says his private morality has no impact on the his public duties this is more\nA than a interesting irony impeachment would undoubtedly energize Mr Trump's base and make these voters even more loyal to him as it did with Bill Clinton\nDemocrats
