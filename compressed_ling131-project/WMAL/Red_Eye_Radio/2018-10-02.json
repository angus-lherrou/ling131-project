know where where where they are located and we know a ton of you listen and you all know\nWhat NBC did was a complete hack job that is in journalism an allegation and it sells without anything else to cooperate it is not a story it's not a story\nThat a manger that a major newspaper or a major TV network should ever run it lacks\nCompletely on any type of journalism ethics and they know it had that been someone claiming that about Obama and two thousand eight that it never would have ... well you know it's coming out now is the leaks completely anonymous\nYeah right there was another one uh ... completely ... of anonymous people are just sending letters hey I was abused right and then that's being like oh there's another letter in from somebody else have you paid attention to social media\nBut you can make these people don't even use their real name on social media most often\nI mean it just and and it's to me it it shows you know that NBC don't ever\nEver complain about President Trump using the term fake news and directing it at you right if you put out that kind of peace I trashed story yeah based on an allegation and you do an interview knowing going in\nThat this person is walking back everything\nThat they say and you can't find anybody to cooperate if you don't do with that story it's the same thing as I mentioned from I ... it was we talked about yesterday from Eric Brady it\nBrady at USA Today\nWhen he wrote well should Brett Kavanaugh will be coaching girls' teams not until the investigation is done and then talked about in his original article a credible source\nBy the way just the un out as I had set on yesterday show I I Know Eric Brady um was it used to knew him as a kid he was a really good friends with my neighbor across the street just\nSo people know that it's important to say that's what you're doing your blood people know that [noise] 'cause somebody might find out there and and I as I said last night I said you know I've I've uh since I knew him when he was young\nAnd you know we've kept in in touch over the years just on Facebook\nA which is a space whose Facebook balance delete it but that was a piece of trash article that he wrote and said you know claim it as a news story not an opinion that credible evidence there is no credible evidence against Kavanaugh\nIt's a ... and and this is and that's why when you said that during the break it just it hit home with me\nThey are never going to\nGet off the break here no no this is and it won't end when Trump was no longer president this is not going to end\nNo because in fact they'll feel more empowered Trump is the one who calls him out the next guy or gal likely won't\nAnd here's what's interesting too so NBC goes with the interview from sweating they admit they can't find anything to back it up anybody else to back it up they go with the interview an interview\nA story on the ... this is the prosecutor brought in to do the questioning at the hearing and the memo was released\nAnd on Monday\nNBC News decided that wasn't worth reporting now yet if Mitchell had reported that my finding is that judge Kavanaugh is not worthy of being seated on the highest court\nThat would have been the lead headline in fact it would have been an NBC News but right now if you're wondering NBC News why nightly news\nIs that an all time low\nThat's it\nNobody believes you and I see right through you\n\nYour tax nothing more nothing less and it's shameful behavior so stop feeling insulted when Trump says your fake news right you're not even worthy of his recognition frankly because\nYou're nothing if you're going to put somebody up there you admit you can't backup independently as a news organization anything the woman is about to say you put her on\nYes we don't feel that the president should stoop to your level\nRight that'll really take them off well that that's in and that's what it's that's ... and that by the way\nComing from a guy who ... who has how many times that we sat on this program there are times when somebody needs to just take the the his Twitter account away for a few minutes\nAnd and there are times when he doesn't speak effectively were he said something that totally doesn't work the communications from this White House have been horrible but that's how bad and the NBC but it's all you don't hurt you shut it you have an earned the right in for him because\nIt's also what you get from the left that well because of this presidents and there were changing the way that we do thing yeah we haven't no we haven't shall we don't care less active communication when we we never we never change our standards of what we will do whether it's Obama\nWhether it's Bush whether it's Clinton while we were working together with Clinton [laughter] whether whether it's a a Trump we don't care no or certain ... and if the two idiots overnight can do it NBC you certainly have the ability to do it you don't want to do when\nThey go out of their way to put somebody on do an actual interview with somebody and that they themselves as a news organization can't backup and one word she's saying but ignore part of the official process and that statement was part the Mitchell a release the memo was part of the official process\nThey could take it and take it to another prosecutor and asked that prosecutor well what did you think did you watch it did you what do you think of Kavanaugh's and Dr Ford's claims and would you say the same thing the memo did\nNot even that they completely skirted the entire thing\nAnd then you're going to have all these guys and gals chomping on cigars in the boardroom at NBC News trying to think what's going wrong wire ratings go well what's what's what's the problem here\nIt's interesting because one of the one of the other stories that came out during the day on Monday is that you have the founder of CNN Ted Turner that says the idea that it has become too political this coming from a guy who's clearly on the left and as the founder of the ...\nAnd are of the network and then you have a the the uh the the former show runner really at the Greenfield Jeff Greenfield yeah or who ran CNN for years comes out and says\nThe people that work at CNN think that they're part of our act as if they're the quote a they they count themselves as part of the anti Trump resistance\n... we know this we see it it's it's very obvious but when you have other people that were you know bear before\nThat can look at it and say this is clear what's going on these people are active it's they're not journalists they instead of opinion they're not even they won't even be\nA there they they like cowards hide behind the word analysis that's a new word for opinion right opinion at the top\nYou have an opinion should be based on some well see that's why your hand analysis should\nBe here's the situation but it's not it's here's my opinion\nSo if you're going to have an opinion piece called opinion but you know what cats are already out of the bag people see right through these news organizations it's not tolerated anymore and you wonder why they're not trusted and you wonder why those CNN shows are at the bottom of the cable news and NBC is at the bottom of the network news\nIt's not Trump it you get eight six six Ninety read I\nWas very much and they're

you guys and Reuters found that people largely believe what benefits they're affiliated party\nMore than two thirds of Democrats believe the sexual allegations against Kavanaugh while roughly the same percentage of Republicans do not\nOverall you guys have found that forty one percent belief for thirty five percent believe Kavanaugh Reuters found forty two percent believe for\nThirty one percent believe Kavanaugh Harris Poll chairman Mark Penn a former Bill Clinton pollster reported Sunday\nThat the Harris Poll found that forty percent who saw read parts of the testimonies last Thursday felt that Ford alone seem credible wall twenty three percent alone said Kavanaugh seem credible alone a total of twenty seven percent said that both seem believable\nOr does sixty seven percent total felt the Ford was credible fifty percent felt the cabinet was credible\nWhere the Harris Poll study gets really interesting is in its findings on the impact of the FBI investigation and the issue of cooperation the credibility of their testimony does not appear to be a decisive factor right span\nRather that question comes down to cooperation as the standard for tipping public opinion on whether Kavanaugh should send to the high court\nWhen we're ... we're told that the three name witnesses do not cooperate forged claims fifty seven percent said they are in favor of his confirmation\nIf the FBI pounds no cooperation for Ford's claims sixty percent said Kavanaugh should be confirmed pen reports\nWell I've seen this on social media I Can't tell you how many polls I've seen do you believe

I'm not expecting them to have the same internal set of campaign without or that a party would have\nBut I Would expect that they would certainly have somebody maybe inside those campaigns are parties\nThat would see some things and say okay is there a real because Obama is always a twenty percent chance he said that after the election but really you know it was a couple of idiots overnight said\nDon't don't buy the hype in Pennsylvania watched Pennsylvania watched Pennsylvania\nBecause there was something else going on and it was anecdotal but if if\nWe could see that really with out and we did research that we're not going to say there were no tools but we don't have the tools that are available that ain't no news organization like the New York times or Washington Post or any of them have they have rooms filled with people second whack and do we ...\nDidn't have what either party had that two weeks before they started seeing the turn in Pennsylvania right uh in Michigan and Wisconsin then and we you know we might have had anecdotal evidence but we didn't have the\nAn anecdotal evidence but we didn't have the same information that they had where they started seeing that the that the turn and and you know remember that as you look at the polls now I mean we're ... we're I'm very interested in what the polls are going to do\nNow for those people that because we always get the people who called ... poles or number right actually they are ... you can find polls as we have done if you listen to the show for any length of time\nWhether it was really twenty twelve and twenty sixteen will really started looking and saying okay what polls were actually correct and what you find out is\nA yeah two months out three months out four months out the polls aren't that accurate once you start getting thirty days in ... ... you start seeing that the polls start tightening and by the time you get\nTo a couple of days beforehand but people for example say that the polls for Trump were completely wrong or they weren't you know there were polls that were dead on for the numbers\nThey may not have the polls didn't figure out the electoral votes and you know you and I said well maybe they should start doing that I don't know how much money would cost them to do it right or at the the by the time you got to the to the polls are done on what the people are thinking\nUh and and so to get to those specific districts and and break them down you would probably need more votes you would meet need more numbers than what you what your sample sizes you know country countrywide so that might be a very tough thing to\nActually do to predict\nBut they did know\nThe internal polls say started about two weeks before that there might be a shift happening or in in certain districts are in Pennsylvania and and uh Michigan and in Wisconsin\nBut the fact that the polls on the where the people voted some of them were dead on yeah you're right I mean judge within a half a percentage got a point of the actual numbers and they said don't show Hillary winning Leno show with Hillary would get in the raw vote and that's what she did get\nVery close to it and the same thing for Trump he won the electoral college [laughter] so you know that's something that they've since we've had two electoral you know two very close votes ... ah you know back in two thousand and and uh in in twenty six team\nYou know maybe they should start looking to see if they could bowl and then\nFigure out the electoral college you know that way if there's a better way there's a better way to do it but\nWell you don't you start back in the day with Tim Russert he would he would sometimes break it down and say and paint scenarios going look if this happens here and these districts here and those districts and this this precinct here in this state\nAnd all these come together you could see the electoral votes in this state go to they he would break those down but you couldn't really I don't know that there was a that wasn't so much of a poll as it was really a demonstration as to\nWhere it might go it wasn't based on sentiment that wasn't based on respondents there was based on basically history and indeed given precinct or or any given district\nIn a state you know they would break that down they don't try and do that anymore but if you if you watched election night\nOh twenty sixteen what\nYou saw was this I mean it was a very smog attitude it was they were almost doing it it was almost a parade for her\nHillary Clinton and then into the evening the later it got after the polls closed it just went down where it was a downward spiral\nBecause it was reality and they had painted a picture and the media helped or something that wasn't true\nAnd they saw it as landslide without looking at again you know how this might add up\nRight uh but looking at the polls now as we were we were you know doing earlier a ... in our pre show meeting a I I see a ton of races out there I mean I'm looking at the Arizona race right now the Arizona Senate race mix Sally versus send them a Christian send them at the Democratic a Democrat and a Martha McSally the Republican\nAnd you know the the last repulsive send them up three seven six and three ah and but the but ah in earlier polls are earlier in the month a mix Sally was up by a couple well right now the latest poll was one to the\nFrom the sixteenth to the twenty okay brush still not into the ... the whole ... thing and cinnamon was up by three but margin of error four point seven so that's a dead heat\nThan if you if you look at that overall except for the uh the one likely voter poll by CNN that was that was done where she was up by seven everything else shows that that really is a dead the that is a dead heat right there\nAnd we don't know what the polls are going into the cabinet vote I think ... and again I\nI think that the cabinet vote has the potential to energize both but I Do believe that it may energize Republicans more\nBe it he whether he is a not confirmed or ... firmed the energy that I see right now the motivation to voter motivation\nOn the right to me is much greater than it was two weeks ago I don't know if I can necessarily say that about the left because I think the left has been on maximum overdrive for the last year looking at the last two years looking at this mid term right\nAnd so the energy is there I Do think just because I how important it is\nWhen you talked about the possibility of and again you don't we don't know one cabinet is going to do cabinet could get on and do what what what Roberts did you don't know mhm but the possibility and I were talking about were Roberts you know change the uh you know the\nThe wording mhm in

thing I Believe I'm not a drinker\nCan honestly say I never had a beer in my life okay\nSo one of my totally good tights [laughter]\nThey're looking for something that I never had a glass of alcohol I've never had alcohol I guess you know for whatever reason [noise] can you imagine if I had what a mess that they would I be the way the world's worst\nSelf deprecating humor from Donald Trump yeah\nYou know the last time that I'm hearing and came close to that was and no one saw it because it was in the middle of the night in the U.S I said two things about uh you know the president and and\nThe timing of things so when he was at the the summit in Singapore uh-huh after they did the the photo up with Kim Jong il and he had his own press conference\nAnd he said to reporters these were global reporters saying look in a year from now I might I might tell you that this deal did not work out didn't go the way I wanted and I'll probably make up a story you know make up an excuse\nThat was self deprecating humor and the other point that that I think uh that was the other thing that America Mr of course was his his wind in his victory speech that night of the election and and twenty sixteen um because what I what I heard was a humble public servant speaking\nAnd of course it wasn't a lot of it wasn't replayed by the media you really had to search for it but when you look at\nYou know the president I think in in front of the people\nEspecially right now we talked about his cabinet being settled in\nAfter the first year how he started to appoint people and we said look this is going to play out differently because they used the people who are being appointed\nIf they accept that you know ah if they're that nomination than they know what they're in for right so he's getting the people that the put the cabinet and place and the staff in place that he really wants in his second year\nI think the case could be made by recent activity or lack of activity that may be the president do this also settling in with the media or he's been directed to tone it down a bit until after the midterms [laughter] it could be either or but I I\nI Do believe that the president has always been in the private sector comfortable in his own shoes\nThat changed when he went from having zero bosses to having more than three hundred and twenty million bosses in one night and I think it you know I think it it it had him kind of all over the place a for a number of reasons during the campaign and after the campaign as he became president\nAnd I think there is a case to be made as he's settling in and learning the job and it has now knows what he can do and what he can't do I think there's probably a little more thought\nBased on recent behavior going into communication and how you interact with media\nBecause here's the thing he's winning on the Kavanaugh's nomination they wanted an FBI background check he gave it to them then expanded the whole thing on Monday\nHe's winning\nWhen you look at the things that that he's put out there\nAside from some gas communication wise president is winning the leftist screaming because not because they think that they're winning they know he's winning\nThey know he's resonating in the media especially that's why they call it the resistance and the first place\nIf you want to get in line drove an eight six six Ninety right I Will get to more of your calls in a comments on the uh uh Kavanaugh investigation FBI investigation and what Mitch McConnell may do and will there be a vote this week\nThey do and will there be a vote this weekend that more all on the way for video road log who's your forecast\nContinued range from what was hurricane Rosa will affect Southern California portions of southwestern Arizona and the

the guy makes a statement we say well this is what you're saying and it's exactly what he said and then he goes no that's not what I'm saying well of course that's what you're saying because why Harry

change those rules are going to change those ... these rules for the Supreme Court justice yeah\nThe people in power we get to check these aren't laws were not changing laws were simply changing rules the Senate that we have the ability to do constitutionally you may not like it but hey when elections that's what Harry Reid said\nRight and Mitch McConnell came in and said the exact same thing that's the reality of it and what you're saying then it's it's okay to defame somebody's ah defame somebody's character because\nThat's the reality of highly Democratic Republic constitutional republic works\nUh and then you got into the point of we now have to go back into the womb when you have a life time yeah position so that does anybody agree with them that we need to go back to the womb down\nAll Supreme Court justices we need to go back to the boom\nWell at least they do this [laughter] how often did you pick your mother that\nDomestic abuse yes\nI'm Sorry that was a little

but last call I ever had well actually I saw the ...\nOver the weekend or if they actually may have been last week [laughter]\nWhen Kavanaugh was born he did what many male babies do on nurses you find female nurses [laughter] it was to make it in front of the three nurse yeah he was born a yes\nYes I Love it yeah well and if you're the if you've ever been in that room and witness that when a male is born also what\nThey do [noise] almost first before they cry\nLet's just say there's a reason they wear those gloves and masks\nWell so we're going to go back to that story about the college professor then [laughter] yeah right they Georgetown professor who says why Republicans should be castrated and that just whine and fed the swan yes a professor at Georgetown University known for making incendiary comments\n[laughter] that's a Sherlock comment against supporters of president Donald Trump said white Republican men deserve miserable deaths for supporting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nSaid Christine fair and associate professor at Georgetown in the school of foreign service treated Saturday saying white Republican men should die and an added bonus would be a woman cast rate their corpses and feed them just whine and to quote\nOkay\nWell that went south quickly [laughter]\n\nWhere you can't have a debate [laughter] you can't have a debate that's the whole point

to go\n... off and go to hell Mm\nGeorgetown University said bears used our own and not the views of the university yeah right statement to the Daily Caller\nYeah in other words we don't want this to affect students to enroll but more you know uh we believe she might have crossed the line\nThere that um [noise] I have a line in my mind\nI Know uh just about where it is\nBy the way the last thing that we ever want to do this is why when we talk about free speech and they want to shut us up and we don't want to shut them up and that's why we don't want to shut them up during never want to stop\nThat Georgetown professor ... letting people know exactly what she thinks and that's why free speech is viewed her beautiful because she doesn't hide it you know who she is and what she said and what she thinks and\nI don't think it's a Georgetown can make their own decision on whether she remains or not that's up to them we're not calling for anything\nWe know we know what populate the halls

I mean you we had at one point two trillion to the debt so that didn't happen you know that's oh wait a minute no no no no no if this is Obama's economy it also has to be Obama's debt right now [laughter] Trump stuff [laughter] well I guess I'd\nSay we're all in the world and there's a big part of it or not [laughter] [noise] well I mean what you think about it if if Republicans\nAre because remember the it's the it's the deficit this year that's going to skyrocket through the roof yes over a trillion dollars in one year and we're not at war now it's not that and it's the Republicans and we're not into recession throwing seven hundred a ... million dollars at at a banks or\nAny of that it's it's the Republicans spending I asked this question in all seriousness if Democrats were able to take over both\nUh the Senate and the house and\nWhat would there never will move the president's budget B that he would hand them and what would the Democrats want\nIf they're Republicans and I don't want to use a drunken sailor analogy because I I think it's unfair to to drunk and sailors and but at least a drunken sailor is ... how did they drink yeah but and they were out of high school and they were drinking fender they throw out ice on anybody\nGot it all relates doesn't it uh\nBut how much would Democrats ... Republicans are ... are spending this much and and the fact is I look I don't blame the Republican Party and I don't blame the president why the American people don't care can people don't care if there is no political pressure this will continue\nAs I said this is this is my uh twenty ninth anniversary that this week of doing talk radio uh the first issue that we hit which was back in eighty nine\nWas the whole clean sweep that Congress will spending too much money and it's time for a clean sweep and monarch forget the protests all over the country people in front of congressional offices saying we need to cut\nBack I think the deficit at that time was four trillion or less ...\nMaybe even three I care don't even remember what it was at that point right but it was nothing and people were upset about it they were actually marching in the streets about the debt [noise] yeah like today some of them are marching into areas\nWhat are you guys marching for the debt who's that national debt oh\nBy the debt for every working American by the way every working American uh\nUh went into debt eighty I think it's eighty one hundred dollar gift year from the federal yeah every working\nAmerican the the debts that basically has its if split up on every working American that adds eighty one hundred on your behalf\nBut remember in the tax bill last year mhm the only the only kind of people that are actually paying more for the debt paying more in taxes are people like Eric and myself who's taxes actually went up\nYes\nBecause working nor mostly wealthy exactly that's why we're as the one caller said a couple of years ago ... millionaire yes which was a surprise to all of us yes keep it up\n[noise] I'll tell you this if I was a billionaire mhm I'd get rid of the my Fifteen year old vehicle\nHas two hundred and ten thousand model oh yeah yeah yeah no I'd put that out with the trash and then it would be going my butler would I Would\nJust because of certain business ... we both share a we can't take them anymore and therefore our our business did matter [laughter] I Know how to cares about oh we're not upset that we are actually looked at the tax by the time\nUh we can't take them anymore and therefore our ... our business did matter\n[laughter] no nobody cares about oh we're not upset that we are actually looked at the tax by the tax thing was the right thing to do is we evolved in state of before a irrespective of the unfairness towards us other problems still the spending\nA and and that's what it comes down to ... because the the the fiscal policy\nUh you know you you look at the the monetary policy of this this nation and and while all over the place especially in recent years but like over the last Twenty years especially but beyond that the fiscal policy become something very different because\nAnd this is it once you start creeping in once you get the foot in the door it as the government provides is provides this provides this\nWill start talking about making cuts start walking into the neighborhoods of America and start saying well in order to get our national debt in order we're going to start cutting back on a this program this federal program in yours your child's school\nNo up start taking things away that's when people start getting motivated that's when they start paying attention now they wouldn't\nThey still wouldn't be able to tell you the majority of them are they still wouldn't be able to name the three branches of government but they would tell you to get out and you are not welcome in that kind of policy is not walk\nThere is because this is what it comes down to for a Obamacare spending and a number of issues that conservatives are watching and have been watching forever and are important because they've always been important\nBut this is it an Obamacare as one of those you know on the way to getting to what the single payer system but the idea that you're going to get something in somebody else is going to pay for it well then the liberals like that one ... in California well we'd like to Obamacare we voted for Obama we didn't know we were going to have to pay for\nThat's why even though you have when you have Jake Tapper of CNN and and even Chris Cuomo\nQuestioning a case yo Cortez daddy and Gail I'm In Florida and and and Gillum about ... you know the ... of Medicare for all the way they understand what we're spending on right now how do you pay we're already going to be a trillion dollars in debt how do you pay you can't pay for all your band and pay for what we're paying\nFor it today it's impossible so the only thing you can do is put massive debt\nOn the uh on the American people the other thing that isn't being talked about either as the because interest rates are going up ... how much of a bigger bite that's taking in how much interest payments the American taxpayer it's growing exponentially yeah every single year now and we've talked about that over the last year but a\nA until it actually starts affecting people and that may be you know you know too late it could be ten years from now Twenty years from now I'm Thirty years from now odds are are you and I will both be dead when it happens but as we've said it's immoral and nobody wants to hear it but it's absolute immoral and unethical\nTo be putting what we want today on the backs of future generations we have is we have stayed in before\nWe found a loophole of taxation without representation we found the loophole\nYour tax the future they didn't vote for it they had no representation they had no say in it they're completely innocent and all of this and we found the most moral way and we just hide our heads in the stands sand let's put it on them and because I said that I expect\nTo get the emails today which I always get whenever I said\nThat oh you're exaggerated the debt really isn't bad it's all in controlling debt is all part of it\nThat the ... ...\nI Hope that sues you're guilty conscience by writing those emails well\nBecause it effectively when it gets to the point that you can't even service the interest on the debt as a nation the massive hit to the economy when our global trade partners can no longer trust the U.S\nIt will be catastrophic in nature to say well we can just write it off on paper and start over\nNope no you can't\nBecause no one is going to trust doing business with you any longer and with that happens then are great show great grandchildren and their children and great grandchildren will not experience or what the expansion of wealth\nAnd the freedom and liberty it brings to their families they won't experience that 'cause they only play there is going to have the government the federal government taking over
