I wasn't talking about my opinion I was talking about right somebody else who told me\nWho is a supporter and we were talking about the possibilities of what could harm\nAnd move independence one way or another and the argument was it's not going to change me or anybody that I Know well I Know that's not the point\nThat it's not you're not you're not part of that you're you're already in the restaurant eating you need you need to build a business out this is this is exactly what the president can do\nAnd this is unique to this president by the way because the Republicans we'd been screaming for years can't get their message across and if they could get it across if they could go out there and promote that message a very simple message then they could get that out and\nThey could they could gain more seats instead of losing seems and this was back then not rise early now we're talking about getting a message across the people who have not been fully convinced yet if you've been fully convinced\nWe've already made that point you're not the one that we're talking about you're not part of that group\nThe the Republicans but more importantly the president\nRight now or they're capable together of getting real things done and they need to get our message out there that\nThere is this and and we continue to have to fight this all the time or we will get people to call well you guys think that you can convince everybody\nOr we don't know\nThat's never been the goal to convince everybody but there are people that look people [laughter] people a vow of every day it's not maybe not be the majority of the population but people learn every day ...\nAh teachers politicians how many look look one of the great one of the greatest things some of the greatest callers we get are people that are called the show and upset you know I used to think this way and then I started ... you know listening to you guys and other people in this politician and this guy and\nYou know you you referenced some people and I gave them a listen to on economics and I realize I changed my mind completely ... people change their minds you're not trying to get everybody to change your mind you're trying to get that that person in the middle and we were talking about specifically yesterday\nUndecided it's about it's the political strategy of always growing your base [laughter] never being satisfied with what you have\nAlways trying to grow it\nAnd we believe if you promote\nFree markets conservative economics conservative principles and you explain it in a simple way\nA nation that largely remains and we're not talking to you who is listening to the show you have sought us out you saw it on shows like this you've sought out information like this so we're not referring to you you already you're already aboard but when there are new people and we get them all the time\nAnd you are able to introduce them\nTo different ideas there is a segment of the population that's willing to listen it might only be five percent but that five percent makes the difference in almost probably bad while I Would guess Ninety five percent of elections out there that is the goal the goal is to win\nYep the goal is not to get an immediate satisfaction because our candidate he leaves a little bit more heated rhetoric than the other candidate we understand that and that's what I Love when people runners you guys don't understand the frustration out there\nYou're kidding me in turn you liked but just what you like to sit in this chair for the last\nThe ration out there you're kidding me in terms of you\nWho liked but just what you like to sit in this chair for the last almost Thirty years Mm [laughter] oh no it's always it's always complete peace and quiet here yet but that's what it is being a conservative radio talk show hosts for the last Thirty years\nAnd it's really an Tom [laughter] it's always a very high scenario it's like doing constant yoga all the time at a table as him oh it's like sitting on a beach so like that just sitting there and\nSay I I got friends in St Thomas sending their version island saint Thomas speech a what a nice day that's what it is\nDay after day here as pure as and\nAnd so the goal is is is the goal to get that satisfaction of getting that hangs out every day at the other side that you disagree but then you believe is unfair and in some cases evil\nNo that's not our goal look after them on the issues go after them with with uh you know with everything you've got on the issues\nAnd spell out where their plan is wrong or what they're doing is wrong and and be very clear about it that's part of it\nBut the rhetoric because it doesn't need to be looked at the point is is that you feel like there's this limited window and that the the the window is closing and it just might here within two weeks and so the point being is that\nBecause we've been doing good so long and we've seen the do nothing Republicans time after time where they've had I mean mess of doors just wide open for them\nBut you've got to get a consistent message out think about where we are right now in terms of social media and communications we have the ability to communicate twenty four seven any given person\nCan be communicating ... you can set the messages are ahead of time to automatically go out while you're sleeping you can you can\nCommunicate right now around the clock get the message out while you've got the economic wins or create some more of those economic wins\nAnd you're building again the base you're trying to get more people into the base that aren't on board\nAlready what frustrates me is understanding that the left uses the heated heated rhetoric that they that they use\nThey do that out of desperation they can't win on the issues they're angry it's the only thing that they have left because they're they're angry and I understand\nThat on you know the other side on on the the side that I'm most closely relate to that it gets frustrating because they're always just so angry and they were spewing out their hatred towards you and you want to attack back\n\nWe don't need to because the reason that they're doing it is because they don't have the substance of their ideas behind them and they're frustrated as hell ... we don't need to act\nThe way that they do they need that that's the only way they've got nothing else they need to be that way we don't need to be that way some of us choose to be that way we don't need to be that way because we have the substance to back up our ideas that they work\nWell well you know here's here's the you know where where they've gone as a party there former leader was in Nevada and the other night and we've gone over the years from that speech at the DNC in two thousand six or two thousand for a to him becoming president and two thousand eight\nOn hope and change to just the other night and Nevada bill ... who vote ... almost ... was it because it became if you think about it it's not even a political tactic what would you what I Would have expected to hear from you know the great or greater\nBrock Obama this big speech\nBuilt on principles and it was basically if you guys don't get out and votes they're going to win the ... okay thanks captain obvious we already know that don't boo vote I'm okay can you can you\nCan in Atlanta who manage it and as we said a total lack of substance on actually hitting the the the issue that's the difference look at you know we talked about how we don't like pit political ideology on either side and but I Do understand\nThat because some political ideology on on the left is based purely on personality and on the right it's not I still don't like political idea I just don't like political I dollar free we worship a candidate it's still always bothered me but the fact is I Do understand if you have great admiration for somebody who is promoting certain principles and ideas\nRight that are that are specific\nAnd work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you said you saw in\nHe is right that are that are specific and work and promote freedom and liberty yet then I get it but as you ... you saw and I think you you made a great thing Obama was almost begging the other day for what you saw was the shell\nOf the Democrat Party which is the other night which is no ideas just

Washington\nPost on there headline had it right there headline habit that the powder that was sent along with all the owner was harmless you know a along with the suspicious package was harmless and and so\nThe the point being is that that\nThe narrative is going to grow obviously politically it's going to grow and and build and and still continue up until election day if not past that\nAnd you don't you don't do any good by you know repeating false information now people are going by their trust of National Review you know based on the headline\nWhich which National Review to me is extremely credible ... at the time but I don't know maybe it's too late by mistake whatever or like I said when I first read it mhm that's what I told us at ... they're saying the bomb was harmless but this is in our ... not on the air\nAnd then realized oh no that's not what they're saying if you read the sentence again they're separating the sentence and Associated Press separates the two yes\nAnd then says pipe bomb now again we don't know there is that's the one thing that we've talked about which again which is when we went through all the different questions that you would ask and the questions that and and that's why it's very important to find out you know whether they were you know ... whether they were\nActive bombs that could have gone off and could have gone off and would have gone off\nAnd uh and you know and\nAnd whether they would have gone off because of the time or or whatever or were they set to go off and what they've gone off or where they just explosive materials that would not have gone off or would we find out that they actually were not explosive materials and actually weren't bombs that they were fake bombs because at that point\nYou would look at it and the questions that you would ask is an investigator would be different\nIf they were all fake bombs than they were meant to just scare mhm or they were meant to be used as a political statement mhm well who would benefit if they were all fake bombs and they were sent prayed political statement would be the next question that you would ask the right\nAnd so again we don't know and that's why we ah\nWhen we talked about you know CNN and others blaming Trump for all of this incredible divisiveness which caused this and as we said don't even realize the irony\nThat they're saying the divisiveness must stop but yet they create the maximum divisive this by blaming somebody for an incident where they don't have the fact they don't know we have no idea\nThat the motivation behind the the the uh the person or persons nobody has any idea and they create this same divisiveness claiming that they're against the advice of this and it's exactly what they're doing how many times a week on the left doing that it's like [laughter]\nWe're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right\nOn the left doing that so I [laughter]\nWe're accusing us something which is exactly what we're doing\nYeah right well and especially without knowing all the facts here\n\nYou know they're trying to put a puzzle together with without all the pieces\nThat\nWe've got to ... in fact until they find we may never know the motivation if they don't find the person responsible and even if they do sometimes you don't know the motivation you it takes a great deal of a detective work no sources of said they believe it's the same you know right people are ... percent or group\nOf people based on them which area which again that that the number of the number of of ah devices that you sent out is more evidence that the FBI can can use I wouldn't be surprised at the FBI or wouldn't be at all surprised if they solve isn't solved it pretty quickly [laughter] yeah if\nYou look at the nature of ah how this was sent a the the packaging the ... if you look at the um the the one packaging for the the device that was sent to CNN\nOr a you know the multiple stamps it went through us ts bomb each of these by the way\nDepending on who they are even Soros has his own private security go through you know he doesn't open his own male are usually people at that level don't open you know anything themselves all of that assorted and there's a great deal of security um but\nBut of course with uh the the Clintons that's the case the secret service for actually has their own sorting that they do so the male doesn't doesn't it's not delivered\nYou know to the doorstep or or in the mailbox like it would be for you and I of course that's that's that's something that's going and has been for a long time and place but but the point being is that\nThey have a a great deal of resources the secret service has a great deal of resources into and and finding out you know and and putting together the puzzle\nThere's a there's a pretty good chance right now based on just having cameras everywhere these days\nThat they know it may be where the facility or facilities were at these were sent from oh and I find interesting is the fact that the FBI knows right now whether these rely bonds or not they know right having said\nThat we haven't heard anything that said that they were armed and ready to go winds and could have been triggered by a ... a phone or whatever I that would be the next question why not write\n\nWell because in in in ... is there a reason that you'd I'm I'm I'm not throwing out a conspiracy ... I'm saying there is there an investigative reason why you wouldn't\nDo it well and if they were armed or or or if they were at that at that point those were those devices were ready to go off\nI'm I'm Wondering about the level of security especially in the middle of New York city ah right there in the building the CNN building or the those employees were allowed to go back it was it was after three o'clock sometime that but they were allowed to go back in the building I'm\n... and so does that tell us anything about the threat the level of threat based on what they know about these devices will find out in the coming days\nYou know because if they were armed and they were ready to go off and and you suspect that there might be more would you allow people to go back in that building\nYou know it's one thing with the Clintons they ... they always have as ex presidents do a secret service detail and they're always going to have that a great level security\nAh but if it's if you're talking about you know the media\nYou have to assume right that the if the threat is real and if that were at that device word dangerous or we're\nReady to go off that there you would expect that there might be more or possibly in the system somewhere um but I don't know we really don't know it just that's the question that we have we're not going to speculate to the point of of conclusion because we actually there's really not much to go on here we just know that you've got\nA\n... ... you've got these devices you've got a we know who the targets were who they were sent to\nAnd and that's about it we ... we were seeing the pictures on on uh on line and in the media as to what the packaging was at least with the CNN device\nBut again where the the the FBI and the and uh everyone that's involved in the uh of course the investigation here they're putting the puzzle together you can't do that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the\nDo that this is why I caution and I think it was\n[laughter] we can't you can't watch Fox News I don't care who they are they have the the the so called experts well here's what we're looking at\nEven the experts sitting in a studio can't tell you what they are really looking at it looks suspicious which we already know that's all we know about this entire situation\nSuspicious packages we don't know anything else that's it and when the FBI tells us or authorities tell us more than we can start having that broader discussion\nEight six six Ninety read I\nWas very much and regardless of what a radio [noise]\n\n\nGo to truckers fun dot org today and learn more about how you can contribute if you are someone inside the trucking industry may be a need\nTo learn how to get can help we encourage you to educate yourself and here's another thing Christopher truckers fun today donate if you can you never know when you may need some help to ... dot org let's band together for a better tomorrow\nProfessional drivers your favorite magazines are now on stands and ready for you to read cover to cover truckers connection offers great jobs entertainment industry news each month\nJob opportunities for owner operators is easy to spot with a hub right on the cover and the best career options for truck owners inside\nFind truckers connection and job opportunities free at Petro Z troubled centers of America we'll post and other truck stops nationwide truckers connection and job opportunities for owner operators we're searching for greener grass Joe ... rich WMA awash\nUn to yell cumulus has\nReport deadly Pittsburgh shooting\nThe sanctions that are the victims of a shooting at a pet dog earlier in the day\nGathering prayer thinking and memory of eleven people kill the president\nFelt an obligation to carry on with these Saturday schedule speaking to a future farmers of America and the make America great again rally\nWe don't want to let people that are evil change our lives\nBefore heading to the rally he pledged to tone down the rhetoric his crowds love with one exception\nAnd I'd have a much different Joan frankly if the press\nThe president pledged to go to Pittsburgh soon ...

away from uh the uh the mid term elections I went out in early voted yesterday ... uh uh went to the local community college was one of the early voting sites for me right and it's pouring rain I mean just pouring rain mhm and when\nIt was funny 'cause I never even though this campus is only five miles from my house I really just\nNever been a never drove through this community college right I'll throw through what the signs were out front on them you know the that you could tell me okay this is early voting for political science all over the place\nAnd so I started driving around trying to find the building saying I've no idea what building that's going to be in but when I but I Will know it when I see it because I had a political science will be all over the place right right yeah and they were ...\nThey only thing is they didn't have any parking\nIf you came in to vote it was all student parking at a college uh yeah yeah which and I just thought to myself because that was one of the reasons I wasn't going to go there I was going to go to a courthouse right uh where you know that was also about the same distance away from me maybe a little further ... more miles\nAnd I was going to go there and I said\nI Want to check out the the the campus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot ... pouring rain but when I got in there everybody friendly ... no matter\nCampus because I've never been out of before so I had about a thousand foot walk Trump pouring rain but when I got in there everybody friendly Mm no matter what the ... is\nOutside the anger the range that we see in the media every day\nEvery time I walked into a polling place hey how ya doing everybody's laugh and joke in what's going on out you're doing in and they had the the the new don't didn't have to actually sign\nYou know how you're supposed you sign you know that okay so ... you don't sign any more you sign on a tablet ignoring the tablet around you signed right on the tablet ... you know with a little pencil I could guess I could have signed with my finger\nI said this is new they said yet makes it real easy um probably because there was nobody behind me in line\nOr just have to just general conversation\nYou know as we've been busy think the reins affecting it they said yeah the rains have backed into today 'cause it's been pretty crowded and then just you know one right up there were three or four machines that were open and went in and voted and it was done now the interesting thing is I was wondering since I'm Out of college campus well let's see young people voting\nNever felt the need or the or never even coming to my mind ... when when I used to do a lot more speeches I don't do a lot anymore because just because of the time shift a used to do all the time you know public speaking alls I never told people go out and vote ever\n... because number one I never felt that was my real number two I'd never felt the people that were listening to what I had to say had to be encouraged about well\nThis is the great thing about especially our audience I I think the the the people that listen to our show and and and especially I think beyond or just new listeners the ones that have been\nWith us for a while I Believe there you know we're all kind of standing\nIn the in that same line ... ... were were part of that that same mentality and again they're they're leaving themselves I Know they don't need me to say it and they know they don't need me to say and that's the great thing there is that uh\nThat that understanding and and the only thing I and I think I mean we might have discussed as before the the only thing that I think that you know war needed for is the fact that there are busy doing their jobs\nThey've got their jobs they've got their families\nAnd our job in the morning right now right and and and and our job is the fact that we have\nWe have time to pay attention to everything so we can articulate what's going on to them so in a in a condensed sense they can get an idea of what's going on every single day and what's going on in the issues in a different form that they can get from anything else and I would say that's about it now\nAnd I'm so glad that I can do that because I think that's a great thing to be able to do\nWell that's you know makes me feel useful [laughter] I mean that's that's what we are I mean the the the uh think of it as a concierge service of information that right I mean I mean are there people out there that I and many of them\nOn the other side of that are very well informed and just tune into here's the smarmy yeah some do\n[noise] all my friends to the weirdos [laughter] you know I mean you are\nIn some way we do actually get some people saying yeah it was good

I how many units are in there maybe three or four hundred which is pretty bad I guess you ... uh and the rate of construction every time we kept its it's almost as if it's not moving along at all and you would hire totally\nAsking why why is it going so slow is the labor is a material I've never seen a building built so slow and this is a major mhm apartment developer in North Dallas for video road log here is your forecast\nWet weather that was located in the south yesterday moving into the mid Atlantic region for the later part of the day is now moving up into the northeast for this Sunday and we'll see that nor'easter provide some more showers plugging along the east coast\nA exist that being said the care of them currently moving from ah the Mexico Guatemala border towards the United states gets Trump's and the Republicans a chance to double down on immigration and issue the Democrats themselves remained vulnerable on\nWhy are the Democrats vulnerable on immigration because they have not just about the attack that they are for open borders thing go\nWe've been saying for years and this is what we said ... pretty much throughout the show yesterday and and earlier this week as well they have to be positioned very clearly the question has to be asked where do you stand on the border\nThey must be\nForced to say it because it's very clear to most people but but they're going to have to answer the question what level of border enforcement do do support\nWhat don't use the word comprehensive\nExactly what do you support we know you don't want the wall that's a given what do you support we know what you don't want what do you want\n[noise] he said again I have argued elsewhere the party should have embraced and immigration compromise where the wall would be built\nIn exchange for a pathway to citizenship for the eleven to twelve million immigrants not here legally remember he's a lifelong uh uh you know a Democrat and former Democratic pollster just you understand but that's really a lot of what we upset that we have ... as we said yesterday and I believe the day before\nOn on the whole caravan thing this is a perfect opportunity for the Republicans and the president to back them into a corner\nAnd go after the Democratic leadership and state what do you want because I still hear it from Democrats what we need to have this comprehensive immigration reform and nobody ever asked them what that means right what does that mean specifically what do you want\nAnd he talks about it here are I Would you be for the would you be for a pathway to citizenship for the immigrants that are here and then a wall is to be built and anybody who comes here in the future must go back and\n\nAre you for that but you can't\nWe have said it's impossible to have a debate right now and has been for the last Thirteen Years yeah because when you when I came on the show together the issue we had to go back and look at this yesterday in the history of our show the first thing that we really discuss was a\nWas a like a Kennedy a McCain McCain Kennedy ... which was the amnesty that was two thousand five just if they they made the decisions to a couple of weeks after you and I started working together right\nAnd so for Thirteen Years the Democrats have not had to tell the American public where they stand on illegal immigration what would they do\nWhat what their plan be thinking about this and that by the way that say Republican failure mhm because of Republican should be demanding every ... every time they talk about illegal immigration it shouldn't be the Democrats ... ... it should be as we've said\nYou make the accusation Democrats wide open borders\nAnd when they cry you are a line fine then you tell me specifically what kind of deal you would want done\nIssue them the challenge and that's what I thought it was shown a saying here that again they haven't had to answer they haven't had to they don't ... they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and they're ...\nThey haven't had to they don't they some of them don't agree with the open borders but they don't denounce it either and he also talked about the elimination of ice how you had that and there wasn't a massive response from Democrats saying well that's ridiculous you don't get rid of ice\nYou don't get rid of border enforcement in this country that's ridiculous that the American public and even Democrats a significant portion of Democrats one border security they may have compassion for people that are here\n\nAnd want to have compassion when it comes to even legal immigration but as we have brought it to your attention\nThe demographics that won the least legal immigration into this country are blacks and Hispanics ... when\nYou look at the polling as to the number of when you go the demographics and you see that the numbers\nOf of\nMinorities in this country who want the lowest level\nOf legal immigration that even from has never talked about mhm it's minorities the vast majority of them the huge vast majority of them who vote Democrat mhm\nNow the American people stand with the president on\nBorder enforcement they do he's winning that politically but\nThe other side of it is is that the Democrats have not been forced to to say what they want at all you know the president wants\nYou know with the Republicans won and and I think that in the entire first off you have to go and you have to be you have to go after the Democrats and say\nAnd you have to you have to force them in back them into a corner and as I said uh get in their face yesterday rhetorically is what I said I don't mean physically rhetorically and make them answer back them against the wall so they have no choice\nTo either you made your point that they're for open borders or they have to respond and give you the specifics that they do not\nThe second thing is sort of what Trump is doing already when he's talking about the care of and saying we'll poll well we're going to pull aid from you mhm but look if you improve your country and you become more capitalistic will be the first ones here to help you write\n\nSo we can't take in the entire world but this is where you need to start focusing on those governments in those countries and saying we're here to help you help your own people from\nThat but\nYou need to embrace free markets you need to you need to do something yes\nBy the way also we when we talked about the imagery you know the the one picture that came out with the hunger and flag ... and all that and so people start question why do you want to come here right do you want to come here to become citizens or is it just to work and then\nYou know go back and then we have to have that discussion as to well what do we want from people who come over here as citizens but first before you even get to any of those other\nThings that I'm Talking about you have to find out what the other major party actually once when it comes to illegal immigration and border enforcement we're not even to that point no how can you have a discussion when only\nOne side has said it has put forth plans of what they want and the other side\nWon't go after they're part of the party than endorses open borders and just keep quiet on it well silence is your consent yes silence is your consent saying get rid of ice is your consent we're not going to get rid of border enforcement in\nThe United states so why are you preaching that now that stuck was shown whose looks like to me as the longtime Democrat\nWho are well to use Claire McCaskill's verbiage a isn't a crazy Democrat or\nA says of course the rank and file Democrats the average person who votes Democrat and they want border control sure\nIn fact the constituency the votes most Democrat most the time actually to get out of illegal immigration and illegal immigration is a demographic that once the least legal immigration into this country look\nYou have a sanctuary city policies thanks for state policy sanctuary county policy by Democrats have been promoting it for a long long time\nAnd now you have the you know abolish ice protest\nThey they're saying it but they're not forced to say the words open borders they should say they should be forced to say it because that's what they're promoting and if they're not where's the pushback\nIf they're promoting border enforcement at any level\nTell me who\nAnd I mean the ... from the party that is\nAt any level tell me who\nAnd I mean the ... from the party\nThat is actually saying that in promoting it is Chuck Schumer promoting that Nancy Pelosi or they promoted that\nMay be a Joe Manchin we haven't heard him but we have you know there might be one or two maybe Claire McCaskill you know she's not one of those crazy Democrats\nBut where's the party saying this is what we want because that's the official\n... political battle how can we how can we have a debate on illegal immigration and border enforcement when the other side won't officially tell us what they would ... what they want right except for those that are in the party to promote open borders and the elimination advice they won't even have the debate right right\n\nAnd that's what Republicans we Republicans have a Thirteen Years the pound on Democrats for it and they failed miserably in that in that role doing so right they have another opportunity to do it right now with the caravan coming will ... is the

it had identified seven suspicious packages\nAddressed to prominence liberal and democratic political figures over the previous three days that contained quote potentially destructive devices and to quote the bureau initially said it had recovered five packages that were similar and appearance and bore the return address of an office for representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of\nFlorida the packages were address to George Soros Hillary Clinton a former president Barack Obama former CIA director John Brennan a care of CNN and former attorney general Eric Holder the FBI said it was possible that\nAdditional packages were mailed to other locations uh this investigation is of the highest priority for the FBI Director Christopher Wray set in a statement we have committed the full strength of the FBI's resources in together with our partners on the joint terrorism task forces\nWe will continue to work to identify an arrest whoever's responsible for sending these packages we ask anyone who may have been formation to contact the FBI do not hesitate to call no piece of information is too small to help us with this investigation law enforcement officials involved\nIn the investigation told Fox News of the similarity between the packages has led them to believe that a single individual or group could be responsible\nIn addition to the five packages identified by the FBI US Capitol police were investigating a suspicious package address to representative Maxine Waters of California\nAt the Capitol Hill screening facility and Marilyn water set in a statement that the Capitol police are told her that her Washington DC office was the target a suspicious package that has been referred to the FBI late Wednesday the Los Angeles central mail facility was evacuated at for employees\nFound a suspicious package which the Associated Press reported\nWas addressed to waters the FBI later confirmed that it had recovered two packages addressed to waters that were similar to the five it had referenced and its earlier statement\nThe LA police department tweeted that its bomb squad had rendered the package at the male facility safe and investigation will be turned over to the FBI so that's the latest that we\nUh have a right now a again a the one thing that is a bit I I\nOf uh right now a again a the one thing that is a bit I I think uh\nThe first I said Well Eric look they're saying that the bottom and I read the first sentence and then I re read it again and went oh no that's not what they're saying now that wasn't on the air to see a\nFight and it was like no they're not saying that what they're saying is it's the powder that came with the the the bomb they're not saying that both were harmless right they're saying the powder was harmless you know that that's what the source said the powder was harmless they didn't even mention about\nThe suspected potentially explosive package they didn't say that either way right on that one so\nUh again that's you know that's what we deal with\nAnd you know we saw yesterday but you saw it again you start from CNN you saw it from the the the Democrats\nAre you know we're picking where well you really couldn't pick and choose the facts because she didn't have any very few\nVery and when do we know these devices were sent we know who they were sent to we know what the authorities have told us already but the problem when you start getting these so called experts and and and they are experts otherwise the him but you can't be an expert about the situation unless you're investigating it yourself\nAnd there were plenty of them on television yesterday\nSaying well it looks like see what you got here and what you got here okay there are certain things you can tell from the pictures you can tell while it was um you can tell the like the label on the packaging that went to see Annette well\nWe had Brennan's name on it we know it was addressed to CNN we can see certain things\nBut in terms of the the bomb experts that Ron well here's what it looks like still doesn't tell us the facts what it appears to be and what it might be for what it actually is could be two different things\nWhat what gets me the most though is again the people the cry that the you know there are the um\nThere are the arbiters of fairness and they're against divisiveness while at the same time they are ... their their behavior is the most divisive which is Trump is responsible for this and you have no idea who did this you have no idea of the auto idea who did it and you're claiming you're against divisiveness\nYou're against it and you you have this kind of surety you're trying to proclaim and you're being the most divisive in that moment\nAnd it's so obvious and they seemed to be completely and totally clueless are aware that it's like a day you're just saying you're against the divisiveness yet you are committing the ultimate scent of divisive this by blaming somebody and you

I I Will set it at all I mean with if you look at the the issue that they were concerned about most in that ad uh-huh uh it was terrorists yes and we've talked about the mid west it was something that we talked about yesterday that the the the the the farmer\nThat is some of the backbone of the Trump support Democrats are going directly at because of their loss of business because of the the the terrorists mostly due to the Chinese so it\nIs something we uh we ... we were you brought that up in the last couple of days when we talk about okay what might affect the Democrats to help them win or what might affect the Republicans to help them win what is the strategy that they're using but in that ad\nIt was terrorists twice here's the interest interesting question outside of farmers that that was targeted to in Missouri\nIf you went up to the average person in the street and so what do you think about terrorists do you think that have any idea what they were in a nation we're Seventy five percent of the American public cannot tell you what the three branches of government are\nYeah um do you know it's\nIt it really is about the presence I guess in the state of the industry or the particular we had a streak right and and and that is the case in in huge farm states it even if you're not a farmer\nUm you know what to do their of their lives are at higher yeah right now you know you know to you know the effect on the farmers and they weren't very vocal about it if you're in that said even if you're not a former\nAh you know again depending on the impacts and they they felt it was worth\nUh making that point ah which you know I Will see if if that point works out or if any of this works er here within two weeks\nA I I think the most notable point is the word crazy yeah because it is it\nThat positioning was I'm not going the way of of others in my party because keep in mind she she's not trying to position this and this is her\nYou heard her say she approves this message this is her campaign that\nShe's not saying the people that are protesters she's referring\nTo her ... her party and we have to point out that we pointed out you know over the last several weeks these are the mainstream high ranking members\nOf the party that she's referring to here\nIn terms of the word crazy that's what that's what they're trying to that's how they're trying to do the position here that board is very important because it likely came back and research\nAnd we made the point earlier that it wasn't she didn't use the word I'm not with the extreme part of my party or she didn't say I don't always agree\nYou know ... you know with my my party in it no saw approach or are you writing again it wasn't it ... the men having the conversation and say look she doesn't always agree with her party and there's some extreme is you know in there that she doesn't she's it was the term\nAs you brought up and so rightly\nIt was the term they felt the term crazy Democrat and ... that she rejects the crazy Democrats you had to be put into that ad right\nWhere the momentum they believe might be moving towards Holly and not her that's a desperate tactic because they're looking at the ... and remember this would be in the undecided voters more independent undecided voters\nWho they are looking to sway one way and it's it's a desperate ... it's a Hail Mary throw Aaron his what it is yes I got to let these people know I'm not part of the crazy Democrats right\nYeah exactly what they're thinking that's one of the things that's coming back in their polling is the independents that ... they're they're they're looking at holy because they think you're part of the crazy Democrats might not part of the crazy Democrats but it's using that term crazy Democrats specifically and not\nA you know not radical ... extreme cause extreme if something is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nIt's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right ah\nI mean it is a term that Democrats have used a lot\nAnd it's almost right and it's almost a mainstream if you will term word right\nAh but this is this is also something we pointed out weeks ago during the Kavanaugh thing is that it doesn't matter that you're not a Cory Booker it doesn't matter\nThat you're not a ...\nA lizard with Warren or just you know pick a number of them that are in the Senate\nOr that are Democrats that could be you know I guess people are describing clearly as crazy Democrats I think we have a couple a times\nAids because their actions and and we said this a few weeks ago their actions go outside of their state in terms of the race right they will uh taint the races\nAnd other states but especially of course those that are neck and neck and I and I don't know I mean there's there maybe one or two but this this race is probably one of the closest in the Senate if not the closest according to the polls right now the latest polls we have\nSo that's the effect is is that come out one Harris or or or Elizabeth Warren or any of them\nThey whatever they do is going to affect those races those other races and\nThose people in the ... the state of Missouri maybe looking at this going what or may not have anything against Claire McCaskill but I don't want her party having that control because she might vote with at some point Kamala Harris or you know as a side with\nAs you're crazy Democrats she ... as she just did as having us\n[laughter] and which is the perfect example and that's the thing\nThat endorsement in fact you point out something that is key here that is likely that action yes one action we talked about it before the vote happened\nWhere does she go on this well she made the choice to go because she didn't want to lose those Democrats in her state that did support the no vote but\nIt's not those Democrats and and it's you know it's it's that scale the tips\nYou know the the water balloon you squeeze it on one side of goes to the other if she loses Democrats\nThen that doesn't matter of the people in the middle for going to be with her and if she can't get them right now she acted as one of the crazy Democrats with that no vote she condones that behavioral Lenny we saw it during the ... Kavanaugh profit\nAnd that's my ... I'm Wondering what the effect would be again on an undecided independent and we've been getting ourselves into trouble because people when we've been talking about\nYou know how you're trying to win an election people think we're talking about how we think and how they should think and we're not we're talking about probably people who don't listen to our show mhm we're talking about the election strategy we're talking about the undecided independents right here in undecided independent\nWho is looked at the cabinet thing and so they're crazy I mean they're ... they're really crazy and I can't vote for her\nYou know a Claire McCaskill and that's and then that's what the feedback coming back mhm that ad may be received by these people to say you're just lying to me right you are one of the crazy Democrats but you're willing to call your entire party crazy that you're that you belong with because you just want my vote right\nBut you actually don't believe that they're crazy right you don't believe they're crazy you actually agree with them this just shows you the lame that where you will go you will call your own party crazy in order to get the vote and then you'll be trained me when you get into office and you'll vote with the crazy Democrat and with\nThat vote on Kavanaugh that was also condoning\nTheir behavior him not you know all of that that's you know that's the evidence to back up their opinion yet to come in to that conclusion his cabinet just proved that eight six six Ninety right I\nWas already McNamara and they're recording the radio [noise]\n\nIf you have driven over one million preventable accident free miles than registered to joined the million mile club on line that red eye radio show dot com red eye radio in our sponsors support your safety on the highway\nPreserving that first stop centers almost half of all drivers spend an hour or more looking for parking spaces it's been hard earned dollars his hind ends searching for that elusive spot in his press a safe place to park or something you should have to worry about reserve it can help\nPreserve a saucer tough smart ... reserve is marking had herself is now take her party with older one point and this is the ultimate reward\nTruckers quick question for you how do you say entertained when you're not on the road some truckers watch DVDs on laptops others just bring a book on their home some people even resorted trucks sub TV or spotty lifeline no thank you me I like to one wind or the end of the day\nIn a book on their home some people even resorted trucks dub TV or spotty why no thank you me I like to one way or the other day but live HDTV in my cab\nAnd what does portable satellite and turn it was it's easier than ever mounted to your roof for storm till you're doing is over then just shut them up in your sleep or genders or lightweight shut up and manager and a daughter Clara was barking at you bought it gets even", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington", "day": "28"}
