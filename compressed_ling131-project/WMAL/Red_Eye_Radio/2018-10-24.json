since the lottery fever was out there I just I had mentioned this Fox News had a great article\nA liberty written by liberty a bitter the mega millions jackpot ... you're not being told the truth not being told the truth yes ah in an effort\nTo create jak pots like this one lottery officials have not only made it harder to win\nBut have continued to lie to us about the benefits of the lottery ... about half of Americans play the lottery according to the most recent survey compared to almost Seventy percent of people in the Nineteen eighties\nYou know that doesn't make sense though because I I've often told the story in the Nineteen eighties I remember I was going to a party ...\nI stopped by this liquor store to pick up a bottle of us were Christmas Party and there was ... apparently some lottery going on but I didn't even know about it because right ... that's not\nTo to use a cliche the lotteries never even on my radar really isn't right I'll pass by it as I'm doing show prep for the show but it's something that's never been on my radar at all mhm\nSo there I was in the liquor store and I just immediately I as I got it for about a second I stood in a real long line of about twenty five people\nBut as soon as I got on the line I didn't even look to see what if they were holding bottles\nAs I got it for about a second I stood in a real long line of about twenty five people but as soon as I got on the line I didn't even look to see what if they were holding bottles or whatever I just saw the long line mhm it's twenty five people there and I just stood up and got no no no you you appear why am I going to cut goes no no no you're buying alcohol\nThere's nobody in line for alcohol the liquor store everybody is in line for the lottery tickets yeah never forget that one I started thinking we're laced with alcohol you already know you're a loser\nI was a just a I was a a mile from the ... mile north of DFW Airport one time and traffic\nLike twelve lanes of traffic five o'clock in the afternoon I look over on the media and close to a line of trees a huge coyote it looked more like a wolf because it was filled out it was it was a heavy set coyote just sitting there\nJust looking at traffic wasn't wasn't a dog it was a coyote and it was just thinking to myself man it's crazy you know you've got all this wildlife like you said it's it's all spread out\nYeah and you know in this neighborhood here there's wild animals all the time you cook a coyote come you think it's a cat but [laughter] we didn't work but it's more like as as somebody when they came over to my house one time and they'd seen pictures of my cat that came over and they said\nThat's not a cab I simply talking about the ... it's the panther fan [laughter] I'm pretty sure he was hanging out at you [laughter] it was like okay this is sixteen pounds yeah are coming up on the show today the latest poll on the tax plan what other issues could affect the outcome of the\nMid term elections and we'll talk just a little bit about John bathe her because that story\nOn the whole pot thing has has come up will tell you about the new company that will help you move out of San Francisco\nAnd the Turkish president says ... show\nGeese killing was premeditated will say about the owners of a bakery will appeal to the U.S Supreme Court the EPA report on ethanol that came out we never got a chance to talk about it\nA lot of uh you yesterday and just are are complete and total election coverage and everything that's going on and and I think it's important because we talked about the polls but I think it's more important to talk about the issues\nThat may be affecting what's going on the stock market yesterday in the volatility of the stock market\nYou know caterpillar not worried why because they're building their parts more expensive why the terrorists we look at issues that could possibly effect\nAnd hurt the Republicans one of the things that we didn't talk about yesterday was the farmers farmers aren't happy because of the tariffs thought you may you may have destroyed family farms that have existed for a long time\nA B because you've taken away because of the terrorists taking away their supply chain yeah and as we told you win even though the president came out and said okay we're going to free up money for them they said that's not going to save us right because that doesn't that doesn't make up all the losses at where I have ... and the fact that we're not we're going to be shut out of the supply chain\nThat for ... and we don't know for how long I mean uh they could lose their livelihood with farmers I mean this is for them it's it is their livelihood so that that towers over Kavanaugh and the caravan and and and anything else that might influence votes and this is they could lose their lively and\nYou've had a ton of small businesses out there that have been affected by the tariffs on steel and aluminum tariffs\nYou think about that if I'm going to hit them in any industry in any region right and in our region its its oil and gas but a farming or an ... in the mid west\nThere are every ... every other business is essentially related to that economy the farming economy so it's not just the farmers but it's the other yet uh businesses in that area that are supported by the\nInternet and that's an unknown quantity right I don't know how you figure I don't know how a lot of these things I don't know how you figure it in and come up with the formula as to who's going to win in in two weeks all I can tell you is the issues\nThat have a great probability of affecting the election both on the Democrats' side as we spend a lotta time on it and also the Republican side sure what it could hurt the Democrats and what

that has gone on I mean there are you get every single day I mean I saw\nYou know that a whole okay that looks like now that the Republicans are going to lose the house yesterday but then I saw other articles stating well no that's not the case and that's why we'll bring you the polls and will tell you what they say\nWe really don't make predictions what we will tell you is the issues and the events that we believe will affect the outcome of the election fair uh I've always said for me it's very hard\nTo figure out what people are going to do on election day for me just beyond and everything the pollsters may\n... you know believe in some of the pollsters do get a get a dump or you know pretty good especially in a presidential election but they've missed major elections as they did for example in Ninety four where they weren't even\nOver the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cobra\nOver the summer on a national poll the Democrats had ten point lead over the Republicans now it's down to four so we'll see where that goes within two weeks for cover electronics here's your forecast\nMoisture tied to hurricane ... in the Eastern Pacific will shift some of those reins into western Texas today we have a marginal risk of flash flooding and severe weather in place for the region another whether maker will be a surface low near the southern tip of Texas\nMhm you because of the tax rates very\nUm you know from ... you you can go just a from where I live to just ah you know several miles north and the tax rate\nVaries greatly yeah and then of course the value of the home yeah that influences the Bible at my tax rate in my town is higher than a quite a bit higher than yours I Believe I'm a yeah my my tax rate is is very low which is why it's one of the most attractive areas in terms of people moving to it\nUm but even aside from that if you've got a a home that's worth more than ... your taxes are higher\nLower rate right so when when you see that and you see the number of of of people and and remember the ... the the the people that will be at that edge\nA aren't the we're not talking the super rich or I heartland about what is viewed in many of these high income areas and as solid Republican voters who are in the middle to upper middle class right\nAnd they're getting hit and they don't like it and what's their only recourse\nRight now they're still a supporter of Trump but what's their records to send the message my Republican congressman and we've always we worried about that from the very beginning\nI don't know how it's going to affect I'm simply bringing up the issues out there that when it comes to people's individual budget when it comes to bend paying more money I don't care who you are nobody wishes to do that and even though won't change everybody's vote\nIt has the potential of changing five percent of the vote yeah which makes the entire difference in a house election so that's that's a you know that's one thing we've talked about the Democrats and we've talked about what what they face the whole Kavanaugh saying\nI'm just the insanity that has come a out of the uh the the Democrats the ... the the the fact that they plan and this was the one thing that may proceed that as they're coming out bluntly in saying we're going to raise taxes\nSo many of them coming out now I'm going to raise taxes now we're going to raise taxes not we're going to raise taxes now we're going to raise the corporate tax going to we need to raise taxes more we need to raise taxes they're actually admitting where they're going to raise taxes and which could hurt that we've also talked about the care of it\nBut and they were in the Republican Party that's one I'm yesterday auto auto dealers see slower sales sparking fears that along expected declined is here now the economy overall\nMay not be and and and the terrorists overall may not change a significant portion of people voting in this election\nBut it will change those small business people that are being affected and\nA caterpillar a ... to the good caterpillar story then they're they're being blunt the terrorists are killing us but the steel in an automobile the steel and aluminum tariffs by the way that this isn't the China thing\nBut it's the United states and Europe and and and Mexico that they're still in effect and it's killing them it's raising the price as we said when the president came out and said there I delivered for you I gave you the I gave you the the new NAFTA or whatever you wish to call it nobody's using the new name by the way [laughter] right\nAnd and uh the his you know and the only success that that he claimed the the biggest thing that he promoted was what he did to the automobile business and we said that's unbelievable but he's promoting the fact that\nHe has raised the cost of buying an automobile in the United states Mexico and Canada and that's viewed as a good thing\nWas a story last week about forward grumbling going to be losing a billion dollars mhm they believe the tariffs are gone there there are hurting them remember every supplier at every small business of deals with Ford in the United states knows if that's coming\nOr or or or feeling it already and every dealership an everyday lives that remember the steel tariffs really been affects that we're from China which has increased across from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices\nThey've been affects that we're from China which has increased the cost from the beginning of the year that's actually that's actually nine months ten months old now because the steel prices were up ... percent by the time we got\nTo June of this year so you look at that you look at the fact that automobiles are going to go up in a price because of steel costs and now because of terror of cost and because of the new NAFTA\nAh and then the farmers as we mentioned in the last break the farmers that are being hit and you're talking about your your talk if you're talking about a\nManufacturing people with manufacturing jobs at a technical skills\nTon of those people are Trump supporters if you talk about the farmers you're talking Trump country and you're talking about farmers that are stream Lee upset because it's not only their current profits\nBut it's a fact that they may be shut out of the supply chain that took them decades to get into and now it's disappeared you made the comment you said a in our ... and you said I Wonder if that's why he went to you know even though it was a wishy washy ethanol plan\nI Wonder if that's why he went to Iowa because for the internal polls were saying you're getting killed with the farmers right now yeah there\nWas a couple of weeks ago because I Will would be basically the center of the corn belt but the farm belt it's not that everything is about the the votes in Iowa or any election in Iowa it's that you were trying to reach that region when you go to Iowa you're speaking to the industry\nThe farming industry not just a ethanol and corn but it's the farming industry uh you you want to reach out with that saying we're going to help the farmers\nAre and and you know in this region in this area in the state\nI don't know what you do in terms of of ah of reconnecting the supply chain this is what they're worried about\nOr they need to have those farmers those companies need to have trade partners all around the globe and when those trade partners for instance when Mexico a set up a port trade with with Canada or any nation that they're selling to those farmers\nIf they're going a different direction as a result of a threat of a tariff or a tariff that that went into place a or any of that if they have to make arrangements a lot of time a lot of time you don't get that back right away you're not you're not going to get that business back right away and that's the concern that this is why the farmers came out a couple of weeks ago and said\nLook ah thanks but no thanks on this you know a four point seven billion dollar a handout we need the business the business is worth a lot more\nRight it's still not making up for what our losses are and we're ... we're we're\nA or out of the loop and the supply chain now we don't know when we're going to get back in ... took us deck I think one of the ... was it took us decades to get into the world's supply chain now are viewed as unreliable because they don't know what you will do\nRight uncertainty as a killer this is what we saw after the recession\nThe problem with bailing out all the banks are putting money into all the banks the coffers of all the banks by the federal government or during the recession or in two thousand eight and to the end of two thousand eight and ... and into a two thousand nine they there were three apparently large banks that were on the brain that we're a\nPossible high risk but they didn't want to run on those things so they put money in all of the golfers well then it made all the banks look\nAnd that's the problem you create you muddy the waters\nWell when you talk about trade trade deals between nations that are set up um ... you don't you don't reconnect that bridge it's like blowing up or bridge and believing you could rebuild it repair uh tomorrow\nYou can't\nThat's going to take a lot of planning that's going to take a lot of reassuring but if there's political uncertainty\nAnywhere in that then your former customers are going to stick with someone else a another nation in this case and they're going to get their supply chain repaired\nAnd our discussion right now is not really so much on the the the substance of the economics of it it's more of the politics of\nWhat is going to be affecting this this uh election we talked a lot yesterday about\nHow the Republicans in so many ways were set up in a way that you don't see a political party in mid term election with a ton of positives and de opposition political party that the Democrats are in a complete mess\nAnd that there are many things because the the economy right now for the majority of Americans looks really good mhm well we're talking about is the old you know in the the impacts that starting to be felt now and making investors very were wary and a core\nConstituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now\nA core constituency of the of of Trump supporters which are the farmers that aren't happy at all now so even though there's a lot of good for Republicans right now there is still bad lurking out there\nUh when it comes to economics that there are Trump supporters that are extremely wary about where he is you know where he may be taking a you know the their particular economy and what's gonna happen to

after an election anyone I've done that before we you know we have gotten calls we don't get as many\nBecause we have spent as a time especially after a presidential elections looking at the polls would actually got it right\nAnd you know we but we you know talked about the the the polls even for you know 'cause we were getting the calls after Trump's victories and they said the polls were completely off they weren't because the polls measured the popular vote not the electoral votes right and on the popular vote you had two or three that were dead on\nAs to you know Hillary winning by what roughly two points I think it was ...\nAnd and so you know there are some polls that are that are dead on so people that say the polls are always wrong that is wrong statement to make a lot of the polls are wrong and a lot of them the sampling that they use\nA you know distort the way that America feels but some polls actually get it right it's just the fact that we don't know which of the polls to get it right before an election\nWe have to wait till after so we can look at the issues that are are that are affecting at a you know another thing is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may if if it goes on for another two years\nIt is and and I don't think it's going to have that much of an impact at all on this election it may if if it goes on for another two years and right and this is this is where uh I I call it\nA a Crump exhaustion\nAnd I've I've just pointing out words just popped into my head right now and and it goes back to last week when I was on vacation and I go back 'cause I've often talked about there's roughly five women that I Know\nThat ... that I abused as examples these are all women that are in executive positions either owned their companies are in management up or you know a high management and the companies that the rent or own their own companies\nYou don't need it seems that this president at times\nThings that the only people he has to satisfy is his base in his rhetoric mhm\nHe's satisfied I Believe his base for the most part\nUh and and I think that those bases as his base has expanded because of the whole capital thing what's your base isn't going anywhere from space isn't going anywhere they're staying with him and and the people surrounding his base are going to stay with him\nThat it's ... it's those people who are okay there's some good things some bad things where am I going where you know what am I think and then boom\nAnd and so I just thought to bring up what the the the one\nLoyal Trump supporter told me who will vote for him again in both probably straight ticket Republican I'm I I guess you know I'm not sure but probably would vote straight ticket Republican who was just finally ... that was the limit the horse based was the limit it was because you had the when you had to when it was a slam dunk win\nAnd then you made it less civil went right\nWhy why are you doing that why do you feel you need to do that when it doesn't help expand your base\nRight and so there you go but uh we get to your calls in comments coming up your life you

I started laughing because\nYou know that isn't going to happen you have to point out and and I believe the times you have to give blood is we've gotten London passionate about it during\nThe cabin on hearing said it's unacceptable to us and we'd been blunt\nAnd you're not an American but if ... if you don't believe in the mindset of due process even for capital\nYou know they were ... Democrats were trying to we use a lot of that in every well it's it's not a quarter law it was a political court where people were put under oath and people were put under old under threat of perjury if they lied and it was not a criminal court it was not a civil court but it was a political court that had much\nOf the same enforcement mechanisms that a criminal court has when you testify right and and so a a a a person's reputation\nIs at stake it was a political court and yes\nAmericans expect fairness and they expect due process Democrats said we don't believe in due process we believe it's very important to bring up the fact that they don't believe in the first amendment they don't believe in the second amendment they now don't believe in due process under the law they don't believe a presumption of innocence\nIf you're not on their side the American civil liberties union has just shocked outweigh\nAny pretense of carrying about Americans and our civil liberties and they just made it clear during the cabin I hearing is we don't care we point out in a very passionate ways you can see I get passionate about this\nBecause I think is very important to point out\nThat people say well I get a look it's it's offensive if you tell somebody that ought to pay for it because they believe there are a patriot well know there are some standards of why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the facts\nWell no there are some standards of why you are a patriot there are some standards of why you are an American I mean what makes you an American it's the fact that you believe in the constitution if you reject the basic tenants of the constitution if you reject free speech if you were jak freedom of religion if you will if you were jacked\nThe second amendment if you were checked\nA due process under the law if you weren't jak the electoral college if you reject it\nAnd and you wish to change all of it\nThen you don't believe in America I mean I don't know what else to say you ... it's it's not and people's about so shocking thing that you're saying no it's not they're the ones that are shocking by claiming what do you believe in America we're just against the basic tenants of the constitution of the United states mhm well that's what America is yes\nThat's that fit bomb you and what they're trying to say is a well it's like when they say no we believe in free speech well no you don't it's your side that says that if I use the the the wrong pronoun in California that there's a penalty ultimately of going to jail right\nThat free speech\nOh no no no see your free speech as bigoted and your freedom of religion as bigoted\nAnd and so no we believe me we believe in negative you know this isn't about the fact that you know that you need to that you need not to point out in a very blunt manner [laughter] what the opposition is for and what they really stand for\nAnd the fact that you you know you can point out and you can tell people this is what's wrong with them\nAnd you can probably say yes this is negative campaigning because what they're doing is negative to this country mhm because they don't believe in the basic tenants of this country so nobody's saying that you have to be nice to them all the time no no our point you know when you have\nThe way in the ... move onto the next when well again I think\nWe've got to win for calling out a a war or a Schumer or any of them to me those those are positives when you're calling out what they're promoting\nAnd saying look what I've done look at look at what we've been able to do and such a short time and what we're doing right now with the economy and look what they want to do with it and then back to and and the other end by the way sometimes\nThe name calling it the the slogan name calling or the nickname calling is very effective\n[laughter] liar Lanny I now I made that went up I don't know\nThat I can use it as the ones I I don't want to get ... was uh what was it I don't know\nWhen you when you when you thought when they said sure I forgot what it was just ... yeah I bought a use somebody's got those listed somewhere all the names that no we've had this so well now it's put people in office hits running it's beautiful ... that is that line that any more [laughter]\n\nAnd as far as we

they're not here at the party I'm trying to work with them they don't want to work with me it was a brilliant political moment yes\nBecause it's real simple it's brilliant and its simplicity that

of a funding will go to border control um what would you support give us the type of border control you support right\nWhat's the border control that you support and be specific and if they just say we're for comprehensive now that's not an answer challenge them yet in their face what this comprehensive mean do you get get get it get it and I mean get in their face rhetorically get the first thing what is the first thing\nThe number one thing and that comprehensive plan\nRight what does that look like\nThe American people by and large want border control do you want ...\nRamos does not want boredom at all but he's not a part of the government so I don't I don't even bother with him\nI don't care what a reporter thing right for ... forget about him he works for Univision go right to the Democrats and say the Democrats keep talking about this All right what would you do what you keep talking about comprehensive immigration reform but look the thing that\nThis has been going on for the last ... you know really since two thousand eight remember the protests that that that happened and still ten years have gone by and still the Republicans have not challenged the Democrats\nTo back him into a corner to tell America what they actually want we know what they want to do because all of the activists Jorge Ramos was attempting to influence and is a major influence on the Democratic party he wants to open borders ship\nSo they want open borders let the American make them be forced them into a corner where they even have to admit it or you've taken every argument away with the American public can clearly see that they want open borders\nSince it's brought up again and the caravan is coming towards the United states and it's the opportunity to have the discussion\nStopped talking about everything else mhm stop talking about things that don't matter you can bring this back right after Kevin ought to be the number one issue again find out where the

... where the country stands behind you in a huge majority yeah use it to your advantage\nYep because at the end of it what you're going to see is that we need to have an open borders or this is what they want this is what they would promote\nIf they were talking honestly if they were going to be Robert rice speaking to ... Berkeley I'm not on health care but on border control they would say no people should be able to come and go as they please\n[laughter] because if I'm wrong well then the left needs to call me out on it\nAnd this is the other thing I Would I Would start doing that on debate stage I Would start doing that if you're the president if I'm if I'm the president go out there in and say that every route\nThey want they're promoting people being able to come and go as they please in and out of this country as they please say that over and over again and have the media fact check it for you\nBecause then you're going to need in order to fact check it you're going to need statements by people who are running for office or already in office on the left\n... ... ... and and this device I'd give the president as Mr President people already know what you think [laughter] forget about what have you with you ... everybody's asking you about the reporters continual ask you what you think\nYou've got to turn it around this what America needs to know is not what you think on a legal immigration or American thing sign a legal immigration you need to get an answer out to Democrats as to what they think so win or lose it's still going to be an issue oh ... I mean what are we lose the house into a ... it's still going to be an issue\nTake it to the Democrats mhm they forced you to come clean about what you think should be done about illegal immigration\nYou've had to come clean you've talked about it how many hundreds of times and the princes act you asked you questions over and over again or ten years really into the major discussion on really since I'm a\nKennedy McCain yeah yeah since early ... when William was that was that two thousand eight two thousand now don't know it was before ... it was two thousand\nGosh too but you know that was ...\nIt was before you came on board no was while we're doing the show\nBecame Kennedy was yeah we were in Arlington studios\nYeah I'll look it up [laughter] yeah I kept calling it scam nasty um yes it was because it was two thousand aids\nWas two thousand I don't know it was it was introduced in two thousand in May of two thousand five right before I started here okay I was one of our personal and and then then it would have been the following year or maybe later that year when it\nAfter it went away that McCain had to go to the um ah the ah he was at the conservative a convention and and had to essentially they said he apologized or he had his mayor culpa but he didn't really you just said that uh he realized that\nThe rest of America was not on board with\nThat uh and it fell short of a a ... eleven days after I started working with you so it's one of the first topics that you and I gather together on the air and that's why I say because I write back and ... again because out here I was\nSo low I remember going you know we saw that and uh and I was so low and I was and so the ... the but this has been going on for a long long time if you think about an hour almost did this yesterday and talking about this\nMcCain Kennedy to day\nMight have a better chance of it did back then\nOh yeah given the makeup on on Capitol Hill that we have right now if you introduce that now I don't know if that's the case with this current president because I don't know that you would have the uh uh the the somebody on the left that would jump on board but I I think there was a much better chance that you would have support for it\nNot from conservative so much but I think because of the makeup on Capitol Hill and there are fewer conservatives at least ... Kavanaugh [laughter] and and you you might have a more support for it but the problem is is that no one's asking them what they what they're trying to promote it but it's\nBeen over Thirteen Years but this has been a huge issue [noise] huge issue because that's really what kick started this whole thing and so it's been Thirteen Years and still the Democrats the Republicans have not or the media have not been able to get the Democrats to admit this is the Democrat leadership and the Democrats in power in the party to admit\nThat they want open borders and that's what they want and if they don't want it then tell the American people what you will do what level of border enforcement will you passed as a piece of legislation and promised the American public you will uphold right\nThat's a fair question to ask\nAnd promised the American public you will uphold right\nThat's a fair question to ask\nCar you for open borders right just bluntly asked that question and if the answer is well no then what level of enforcement\nBut think about Thirteen Years and you haven't been able to back a Democrat a major Democrat into the corner to make them either sweat or answer that question and then keep pounding them on that question as the opposition party over and over and over again\nBecause we need to know do they actually want comprehensive immigration reform or border enforcement or do they want to open borders we can come to any type of compromise or we don't know what they want right and do it and get it on eight six six Ninety ride I [noise]\n... ...

A. how\nWashington comes to non\nThe radio he is there an hunting I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety right I just reading here from CBS News out now this this is fake money here fake news yeah\nThere's this this this this is what's wrong with the media today go ahead\n[laughter] they've got a headline right but the first paragraph one winning ticket was apparently sold for the world record one point six million mega millions jak a\nAnd a and a nod million and no ... and they had to write in the headline\nThat headline was right mega millions old record one point six billion dollar jackpot one apparent winning ticket in South Carolina Lindsey Graham has resigned apparently\nDecided after winning I just that's just that would\nBe so funny if it were if it were him yeah uh well congratulations what does that person going to a group of people going through right now if they know you're talking about freak out mode\nThey there's someone wrote the story again you know because they\nThey did the series on a on cable either ... stories of people winning the lottery and it just ended horribly\n'em and someone did the story here's why you know it would be a here's why it's a good thing if you don't win and they pointed out those cases that was a that were in those specials or you know people just I just well first of all\nDo you can't tell anyone you tell even your family were gets out even if you don't go public at that when you claim the prize\nThe word gets out when people know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it\nPeople know that you're you're rich but even more so that you won the money this way you didn't earn it\nAre off the wall and they disconnected their phone the next day and left and you know because it it I'm sure it became crazy with\nRelatives you didn't know you had in the whole thing um\nAnd and that's the real you know that's the real risk of it because that's like we said the psychology is different because people look at it as well you didn't earn that money and it's a jealousy thing and they were trying to win the money and their little dream in their mind of them winning the money and you got it\nAnd you're there relative oh wait a minute I Want or or just somebody that that you know and sometimes it's not not even people you you know\nSome of those stories about the just the you know and then God Bless all the non profits but\nNonprofits non stop knocking at your door\nYou know and you want to give back I'm sure most people would but you can you can give you know I mean you could pretty much give all of that away a few fulfilled every request there would've been\nMuch more time and when I was younger me winning the lottery these days and be like what a hassle [laughter] well I said okay okay so I thought about it would change my life too much\nI thought about that kind of money\nBecause after taxes uh it's going to be somewhere around what five if you want it the one time payout it's somewhere around the third or thirty five percent\nYou know of the overall price a one point six billion so pair that down to about a you know somewhere around five hundred and fifty sixty or or six hundred million dollars that's a ton of money you're richer than Mitt Romney already\nYou went to bed poorer\nThan than a Joe Biden and you woke up richer [laughter]\n\nStory always goes there was one of the least rich guys and the Senate um and and you woke up richer than a minute [laughter] and and the whole thing is is that\nYou you ... what do you do\nI've always said like those really expensive cars really expensive sports cars you know if if I were you know the billionaire and I had that kind of money but still knowing myself where in the world would I drive that car wouldn't be able to stop and park it anywhere\nYou know what I mean I mean where are you going to take that ... I wouldn't mind taking it out to Eddie gossip just plays the Texas anyway and putting it on the track a couple of times but I mean what are you going to do with the money I'm at the point is is that I Would be so paranoid\nAll the time with six hundred I mean instantly having six hundred million in the bank it would it would be a bit disturbed there's\nThere's nothing I'm I'm not saying I wouldn't want you know I [laughter] and I and I have a clear it would it would be a huge hassle ... uh I like my life ... I don't want to change mhm I and I don't care what anybody says\nThat kinda money changes your life I have a a set of changes the reaction that everybody has towards\nYou as your life I have a a friend who uh a friend or family member who are bad boy at one time was working for a a multibillion um and it is you know how we talk about the president sleeps four hours a day mhm\nAnd my family member told me that this person was the exact same way\nOnly because there's not enough time and today we're talking about this with our own schedule and sleep the other day and how my schedule was very busy [laughter] not a multi billionaire although ... at least one listener things we are um but but\nThe point was is there's so much going on now this person earn their money they didn't win their money they earn their money um but but still you've got so much going on managing your wealth\nIs more than ... and I also have a fulltime job yes ah you know you hire somebody else to do it but there's the other problem I Can't trust anybody else\nTo know I couldn't have lost\nAnyone else to do that that would be the thing because you know people ... what would you do and I said ... I don't know I probably would I'd want to distance myself from the money in ... set up some kind of foundation [noise] you know and would I be able to do this because odds are if you win that kind of money you're not going to be able to keep your name private so this\n... it would be it would be hard to manage you can you can do that legally and in terms of you know claiming the prize\nBut\nYou've got that kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually ... exactly the the word you're ...\nThat kind of it's six hundred if all of a sudden you're worth six hundred million dollars someone's going to notice eventually\nHe exactly the the word your life your life is going to change managing the money because of a sudden you know I'd probably want to come up with some type of ... what I Would do I don't even know what the foundation but that means you've got to run the foundation so this jobs gone well I don't want to run my in laws there are laws about\nRaising the money away their laws about giving money to your it let's just say you wanted to take it you claim the prize but you want to take this and you want to go give that to your family members\nWell there are tax laws if you just write them a check and you got to pay the gift tax\nThe giver has to pay the gift right well my I guess my point would be it would be a full time job figuring out what to do even if you're not going to give it away that's what I mean they're going to be a full time job is gonna be a huge hassle yeah and it's like oh\nThis life I have is gone well I liked his life fight right I don't know if like I said if I was in my twenties or thirties I'd probably be going yeah All right good player but let's have a grand old time but all of a sudden you get a little bit older and like my like what I'm doing yeah I don't want to change my life I like my life\nWell yeah but you're you're not as secure as you could be well that's part of why I like my life yeah I I don't do I get to do challenging I get to do challenging things that I you know I I like everything that I get to do and so I'm\nI'm not saying that there wouldn't be a part of me that wouldn't be greatly excited about that mhm oh yeah 'cause I don't know I Would love to you know I think about it here's one of the worst one thing I think about that if I ... a mind but it's it's still a thought oh we're talking about is is that if I Want one point six billion [noise]\nBecause every day I mean I ... the average person out there and I still consider myself sort of average I don't\nYou and I think alike it's not like we don't even think we're on the radio we do a radio job but it's like no it's just like any other jello we've we've ever done really I mean it's not I never think that\nOutside of being and doing this I never really think I'm On the radio someone somebody comes up and doodles today a little shocked we work in an older warehouse for those that don't know where you're I mean we really ... it's almost like we've come to work at a warehouse that we just have the end of the show we grab our lunch pills and go home and that led to that said that's what the\nFeeling is is like that in the last time I work third shift this is the only time I work third shift\nOutside of being a machinist so the mentality sort of the same friends so I but the the the thought is and so there are still you know challenges that I think of every day and what to do here and there and you know a a just and financial decisions and everything else\nThat become a part of your life everything that you're doing in your business and personal life were you one point six billion\nAll that goes away and I always think to myself I don't know if I Want to get to the point where the only thing\nThat now is it in my way because I bought him one point six billion the only thing I'm thinking about his death [laughter] right then I got all these other things but I can think about it basically keep that the thinking of debt at a distance well all those challenges in problems are taken away and all of a sudden I'm going to get all this money\nDeath [laughter] I was a you know I talked to one time about this uh there was a a guy and I I'm I'm blanking out on his name but he he developed a game and he sold it ah I I I don't know a five to look it up but anyway the guy sold his game or the company that you know that surrounded the game\nFor two billion dollars\nAnd his take of that was a you know roughly like one point eight so he became a billionaire you know overnight I obviously he was earning before that but then he talked about one night he went on it wasn't a ranch just a series of tweets and he was talking about it was that this party\nAnd it was the first time I was in a room with other billionaires\nAnd I was talking to people that I had nothing in common with\n[noise]\nI did but then I talked to this girl who was there and she wasn't a billionaire so we talked to one girl who was a billionaire he's a single guy\nAnd he had nothing in common with her but here's the problem he talked with a girl who you know worked you know for a living had a job and was not a billionaire far from it he had nothing in common with her\nAnd it was what I'm not trying to cry I'm just I'm just saying it's a weird odd place to be in because I'm you know I'm not from money\nI'm new money but I don't fit in with these people and I don't fit in now with the people because you don't know what the motive is here's a here's a problem\nWith being famously wealthy or like the the the the person in my family member works for you've got to put up I mean your security surrounding you all the time yeah that's the other thing here famously wealthy so you have security detail and talked about this with the president the president has ... security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president\nIs that just security detail that\nIs is parallel to you know the types of security detail for you know maybe not necessarily the president in terms of the training but you know up in that level you know what I mean and so you're going to happen to be very careful because there there are threats against you all the ... one of the", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year":
