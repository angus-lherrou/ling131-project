I was back in New York and went to church my parents so yeah just blow me away this whole thing\nKnow what I watched a while we were on a break recently I've watched the movie a spotlight\nA that was the movie on the Boston Globe you know they have their their spotlight division for many years and they did the basically the expos they there are in in Boston and the the process of kind of following that you know through the years\nAnd at the time that the movie came out there was a lot that wasn't no\nAnd then you saw the uh the authorities come out about a Pennsylvania Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania and then the latest about you know from buffalo and everything else [noise]\nUm but that movie was kind of startling it was when I re watched it it was even more startling you know it was it but they said in the movie basically what we said one of the characters in the movie I'm just said you know can you believe it can I go back to church essentially could I ever go back to church again\nFor cobra electronics here's your forecast\nThe movie I'm just said you know can you believe it can I go back to church essentially could I ever go back to church again for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nIf you missed a chance this weekend to being a part of the country to get out and take a drive and see some of the beautiful fall foliage you're actually passed the peak season for many locations around the country the upper Great Lakes including northern Wisconsin in northern Minnesota\nAnd are being starved and and all of this well that there are many we could if we want it to allow that in our society we could just say OK authorities canal just walk into homes at will\nAnd to just to see if any crime is being broken or committed a new in one of the neighbors ah of the shooter the synagogue shooter was was talking on you know Fox News saying\nI didn't even have a new there was no clue that this guy was that was a white supremacist I I didn't know and I wish there was a way to you know to tell\nI Wish there was a way how do you know what's even in a person's heart I mean maybe ... people close to them do um but then beyond that and how do you know\nHow do you change\nTheir heart ah then how do you predict whether or not because there are plenty of people filled with actual hate when they don't mean people on social media just talking you know negatively about someone we mean people filled with actual hate\nThat are potentially deadly while there are a number of laws we could pass to keep because\nUh you uh you know this guy was on a apparently a a social media site I'd never heard of a that was what was the social media site for white supremacists\nAnd\nOkay so your we could say that participation in such a site\nOr is against the law we could say that I'm speaking out with hatred in your heart real hatred for groups of people are based on their ethnicity or or or culture that's against the law we could pass a number of laws send it out I mean how do you change your freedom\nOf speech ... part of the reasons that freedom of speech speech exist is so people do proclaim what they think so you know who they are you know exactly how they all you do by taking away their free speech rights as what you send them underground as what you do\nAnd and when there's pressure from you know society because the reason maybe I'm guessing the reason and I think it's a solid theory here that the neighbor wasn't aware of of this kind of you know hatred in this\nPerson's heart is because in our society\nWe don't tolerate it morally speaking forget about the legality of it all forget about what can be done legally morally we don't tolerate that because the overwhelming majority of people don't have this kind of hatred and evil than there are no\nAnd you cannot ... and and that's what it comes down to there's there's no way of knowing for what ever reason whatever motivation a person might have\nI mean think of all of the reasons that might be stated a in terms of the motivation of of any mass killer in our history while the list is very long [noise]\nKnow I I was just I was going through the headlines are just yesterday just in real clear politics and and it was a it was just really interesting ah Donald Trump the so shameless liar\nThat's the headline of an article written by former president for rock Obama got his by what has a no one family Detroit News pianist we hate each other\nBut the one I liked the most was Justin Fox Bloomberg's headline if you ignore the news America actually seems pretty nice\nIf you ignore the new view ignore the news it seems pretty nice ... well I I just I thought it was you know I didn't even read the article I just I saw it but I but it's it's something that you and I've talked about before where we've we've said\nAh for and and I mentioned for example everything going on in the news and you walk into the voting ... everybody agreed to how you doing what's going on you know you're voting location what's going on good to see a\nOh the weather's bad Oh thanks for voting pick up your thing things you take care of everyone I mean everybody goes and it's very orderly very nice I don't think I've ever had a non pleasant time ever voting in my life but that's actually the reality of it you know of what goes on\nFor the vast majority tens of millions of people out there one thing we talk about you know the the news media\nAnd you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always you know and and it just because it's it's\nYou know the the news media and you and I have talked about this a lot that they're always you know and and it just because it's it's it's the news the news is what's unusual that's one of the first things I learned in journalism class is news as the unusual\nThat's why why murders\nAre new some because for the most part they don't happen to the vast majority of people not to discount that murder isn't bad but the fact is the majority of people the majority of the time\nNever encounter a a a murder right many some families do but the majority of families in this country do not\nWhen you look at the three hundred and roughly thirty million people in this country still mass shootings mass murders\nAre quite low but when you look at the uh\nPsychopaths that exists out there\nUh when I was just watching and how many the documentaries every watched a on it but it was another one on on Ted Bundy yesterday\nAnd talk you know the going through the transcripts of his girlfriend at the time I'm telling you just haunting yeah she was trying to figure out\nIs he\nIs he not named going through that progression of her there's no it can't be and then sent you know since he's brother ... the Ted 'cause the exact same thing\nYeah that's a door on the FBI you you know how dare you this isn't this isn't my brother and then finally you know started thinking about it and said well okay I guess I have to deal with reality\nAnd it's not that it gives any you know um there was no on us or or or responsibility on the part of his brother necessarily because it was as if you know he was warning at ... he really was learning about you know what his brother might be capable of doing or was capable\nThat turned out of doing a A N and that's the case with any of them you know the neighbor here\nOf the shooter at the at the synagogue you know you think some of that and\nI'm sure in in his mind is wondering wow is there something maybe that I should have paid attention to you know closer is there something that I could have done we all do this and by the way this is how we get to this point I was saying there must be a solution because in our hearts\nThere should be one this in our hearts it doesn't make sense but we're trying to make sense of something that will ... the overwhelming majority of people will never be able to connect with\nIn our minds we don't think this way we don't have this kind of evil in our hearts we don't have this kind of hatred for people it's quite the opposite we have love and respect for people\nAnd we can talk about disagreements but I always put it like this it's like a family\nYou could sit around and and if you go spend you know enough time [laughter] with your family you can sit around and you can have the ... you can have concerns and arguments and very passionate arguments on very important things\nBut the moment somebody else walks in that door and starts threatening interview and starts going after any of you that's when you stand up together and say wait a minute hold on here because\nWhen you put this all in perspective we're always going to have very passionate discussions about American politics that's going to be the case in we should be the case when you talk about the the tactics right now being used\nDo away with the process do away with the constitution do away with the electoral college all of these things that are ultimately about giving individual's rights\nAnd and instead we're looking at more and more taking away those the people's rights the individual rights of Americans that becomes a real threat but it is not something\nThat is in most people's minds something you respond to with anything else but a vote or debate\nIt's that simple and that's who we are everyone greens most good people grieve when when there's a loss of life that's who we are as humans that's who we are as a society the the people the very few\nThat have these arrange mines that are that have evil in their hearts\nWe'd like to be able to come up with a solution to try and predict it and try and stop it ahead of time and I I Wish there were way but as\nAs it stands right now it's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society is going to happen\nIt's just impossible as you mentioned Gary sometimes in a society it is going to happen\nWe can learn from it but it doesn't mean that will be able to predict the next one or stop or prevent the next one we look to learn from it because we all want to stop the loss of life in a situation like this\nWe'll talk more coming up if you'd like to get in lines open eight

forth who had the worst unsolved\nWho made who who who made a the the social media statement that can be perceived as a little bit more violent than the other person even though it really wasn't violent and even if they were kidding around and we're like let's talk about what really the political divide in this country is really about\nWhat is the substance of the political divide\nRight and I believe from my point of view\nThat's that's what I fear\nI fear a lost of liberty I fear a loss of the protection of the uh minorities in this and and and I mean across the board I'm Talking about constitutionally speaking ... the the reason we live in a constitutional Republican not a direct democracy\nAnd that's why the call to get rid of the Senate and the call to get rid of of of ah the electoral college even if it's not going anywhere it shows the intent of war\nBut let wishes to do when you see sanctuary cities when you see open borders when you see their leaders promoting

what makes America America not rhetorically speaking not who's got the bigger flag not not who proclaims that their American more than you\n\nBut those who actually believe and wish to defend the

I don't know I'm a resolution or a change of heart we're talking about the very basic fundamentals of the country of the nation\nWe're talking about the building blocks of the nation\nBecause what you have\nIs where they build the numbers and people supporting all of this is people not knowing if the willfully ignore it but that don't know because they\nBelieve that they can have a big government

have a shot New Jersey and\nAh with the with the uh Bob Hugin against or rub yeah there's I don't know about the last one shows or this is ten sixteen minutes is up by five margin of error for point or excuse me Bob Menendez up by five ... five point one Menendez all over the fifty percent mark which\nIs usually a a great indicator that you're going to win but uh they claim they believe that they had the chance so I don't know yeah I I don't know why they think that I'd like to see why and and and unless you could say you've seen the polls closing has been in his was up by nine the middle of a you know just a right two weeks ago\nAnd and and unless you could say you've seen the polls closing\nHas been in his was up by nine the middle of a you know just a two weeks ago ... and a couple of days later okay he was only up by five okay there was just a day difference I'm really not a lot you're talking about a couple of days difference there was momentum there hasn't been a pulse since the sixteenth so I don't know what they see something that ... in there and turtles right we haven't seen yet\nYeah I'd love to know what they're seeing though uh that that would be very interesting that would be very interesting uh some very close races though right now in the Senate\nI think you know you you look at those and and you would gets down to election day is going to be really tied on about for at least three or four of those races for video road dog here's your forecast\nIf you missed a chance this weekend to being a part of the country to get out and take a drive and see some of

don't know I Love to know money here leaning Democrat okay wants open borders okay one day here's here's we're line here or there if we want safety here here's a point at one\nTime we we can debate the numbers some other time but let's say that's absolutely true that nobody ... deported more than President Obama then why is Trump being demonized for believing the same thing the Iraq Obama believed if things are hyper ... has\nA little bit less than ... than Obama did when it comes to his ...\nHis way over and he talked about the way he talks about it not ... not what he wants to do nothing subtle he's all art against what he wants to do is that what you're trying to say\nOh I'm trying to say is the is it seems to me or as someone who is your brother is your fellow American citizen and I love you don't have a ton of conservative friends Republican friends\nWe're all brothers we're all brothers what I'm saying is that\nIt seems to me that in the way he characterizes people who are\nIn need and if you were in their position if you were in the same position you want the best for your family you want you would want the best for your friends you would you would want the best for yourself you want the best life it seems to me that\nLanguage in okay but what is not ... you're not there after that where gestures guilty okay well let me we're ... we're using language to characterize right right well here's ... here's the point is ugly right now that people are dying in my opinion on those are okay or evil or dying out of the result\nOf hatred and partisanship coming from both sides and I will tell you that the left as justice guilty\nOkay you're not here so we want to thank here's a point that I Want to get too because you this is very important because one of the things that that really gets to conservatives because conservatives have compassion and I believe and I believe that and I believe that that the the yanks when we are we've got some\nInterference or I Believe the Trump is compassionate\nI Believe Trump's rhetoric at times goes over the top ... example [laughter]\nYou know the example of going to give [laughter] keeping the conspiracy going the cruise Ted Cruz's father was part of the Kennedy assassination so to me that was the high level anything since then has actually taken down a little bit because that's what the heck of an allegation\nSo we understand that when it comes to hyperbole he can go over the top\nBut don't you care about the substance\nIsn't only hyperbole then is that what you're claiming Democrat or Democrats only care\nAbout how you say it's not what you say and you also have to understand when it comes to the theory that exist in America by a lot of people including Trump when you see the Democrats wish to protect illegal immigrant criminals this is not\nUltra partisan to get people angry it is the reality of what exists today stating reality is not hate talk but when you have the Democrats who prefer their preference is the safety\nAnd security of illegal immigrants criminals over American citizens yeah you're going to get people angry including the president ... ... what's going to happen um look and by the way the whole thing with the remember the president said the rapist thing and you know it's it's you know you and I for example we've said you could take quotes that we have said and\nAnd you know in the context of not knowing other things you could take it out of context as soon as that was said he goes no I mean the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people tried to come across the border we can't do it so we clarified that\nIn the the bad people not the good ones and he said we know there are good people try to come across the border we can't do it\nSo we clarified that a long long time ago in fact be clarified that right after it happened yes but again it was a what they did was they took it and they ran with it at all or rapists ... no you said all he said rape as\nWell and he didn't say they were all rape is won't him across it and and ... change the making the point the very simple point that we have to that every single person that comes in this country that was the point he was making yes\nBecause does the most hardened criminals are the ones you don't want to hear\nVery simple or something I'd like to

know over the past few years especially over the past twenty four months we've been trying to define what a conservative is\nA I think we all know what the liberalism there are varying degrees of liberalism but it starts pretty much on the foreign left and then goes to the extreme\nFar left well tell me what a moderate is forget about conservative or liberal tell me what a moderate is one of the stand for what are they promote\nAnd how they vote\nAnd I've talked about how a a talk\nTo a a relative by marriage who was a college professor and it was a liberal I mean I really never got into the conversation and did the shirt our family reunion and even though he's a liberal he rejects what's coming from the Democrats completely and he said about Trump said\nJust look my dad loved Trump because Trump look his rhetoric has over the top but\nNot a racist he's done ... come on is a New York city deals with everybody and this guy's a liberal professor who says I Can't stand being on the liberal campus was he said because they're not liberal anymore now she would be in his fifties\nSo he might still be some of the old school liberal set exist out there versus the new school liberals

Republican [noise] uh but Greg Abbott absolutely dominating in the polls I mean there was one you can go back a couple of months you can't find one that's not double digits\nSo you've got a ton of people because if he only gets six or seven wins by six seven eight points Ted Cruz and have it once by twenty huge number of people who voted for Greg Abbott voted for better or voted for Greg Abbott and would not vote for Cruz why would be my question\nWell you know we'd have to point out and I don't know if this is a part of it or if this would be in and the you know part of the answer to that uh that you would get if you were to learn that\nBut we we talk about two years ago Ted Cruz being the Damon oh I yeah I agree with you you know and and you know I mean back when banner was was speaker of the house and and you know ah there were people in the Republican Party we know that in the Senate and in the house\nThat hated cruise but I mean if you had any question you look at what happened at the RMC at the convention in the summer of twenty sixteen\nYeah but without the age but now he's beautiful ... yes right well because now he's useful but if he decided to challenge the president's managing and twenty twenty but isn't that politics though yeah of course a stranger and I was better find was that it seems to me yeah that's and and it's nothing new but it it is\nThe same thing is is that okay well but\nIn that setting it was about his lack of endorsement\nAnd now it's I think you could probably point to a number of people that say that still stuck with me\nEven though the president is with him in Houston I'm not\nI mean I I think he would probably again with some I Can't even measure that but I Know there are people that support the president right now support governor Abbott and are not going to support Ted Cruz for one reason or the other\nBenefits it's likely because I'm I'm guessing a handful of them at least are saying it's because he did not get on board and twenty sixteen I Would\nLove to see those votes how many votes for advice but don't vote for Cruz at ... or ... just don't vote for Senate\nMhm yeah no there or you know if you if you look at that there there could be a number of them that aren't voting and the Senate or how many of them\nYou know are looking at the governor's race and and you know going well yeah that's it that's all great and wonderful but Lupe Valdez is not our ... there were a number of things that came up and her history as a share of that the left is considered the ... in fact been more vocal about\nUh of course in the in the past few months that they're concerned with her actions as an and policy of the basically the Dallas County sheriff department\nUnder her leadership so you look at that and then and those that probably has some to do with it again you know you could put some of those answers in that category but we'll see what word comes together I guess on election day in and how many people actually did vote for Abbott\nOf wouldn't vote for Ted Cruz that's an interesting question and point eight six six Ninety red eye\nIn addition to being required by law pre and post trip inspections are vital to the safety of professional drivers conducting thorough pre ... inspections allows you to catch any problems before heading out on the road post trip inspections give the shop time to react to any problems that were identified during her next pre or post trope inspection\nCheck to make sure your fifth wheel securely attached ten free of any excess of where\nThe train or can can and must be launched properly and the jaws of the fifth wheel also checked to make sure your safety chains are attached properly\nPA trucks service understands the importance of these inspections if you find any issues during your own pre or post trip inspection stopped by a location near you have your vehicle looked at by one of our expert technicians\nThis maintenance tip as a service a TA truck service road squad if you break down we show up called eight hundred nine two four shop\n[noise] really bug\nThe surface of the truck service road squad if you break down we show up called eight hundred nine two four shop\n[noise] book born with a radio with a record ...

Bush and John McCain while they weren't Hitler Hitler but but definitely this guy is really Hitler but that's\nThe that's the um oh the ... they really want to come out and and make you believe that this guy\nOr whoever it is the most recent with Iraq the current threat is the one that is is is the biggest threat to you right now the only way they can get away with that or they think they can get away with them as by creating a monster and the person\nYou know a James I saw the a young black Leadership Conference that the President Trump spoke to the other day and I saw one of the young people that was interviewed that said\nI'm finally off the plantation and when he said that I went wow that's going to drive liberals just crazy but to me and I'm not black\nBut to me when he said that\nWhat it was was I I'm I'm Out of the I'm Out of the mindset of groupthink that it ... it I'm involved in group think find being told that I must think this way because of the color of my skin then my mind is still in the plantation\n[noise]\nAnd that's what some of the ... and you're you're you're pointing the finger at a phase\nCogent plantation what I'm saying what what are you a are on right now that wanna allows you to think as you really think\nBecause when when you're talking to folks about the homosexual ... and the marriage thing or whatever\nThat you're talking about mission by issue is up with more of a conservative mindset but because of their best so brave brainwashed and ... of racism racism racism racism at clouds their their their their Judgement [noise]\nYou know I Wonder 'cause you know we've talked about the identity politics with a with the ... with the Democrats in and the identity politics that are really I think come to the forefront because they're so radical is you know number one the transgender movement where if you're\nA a man you can be a woman and the the country in law's must\nRecognize you that way and then what we've got into now is transracial that if you're black you can be white and if you're white you can be black\nLegally and when I started thinking about that and wonder\nHow many cars we said this we said what the transgender it seemed that there was more acceptance and when they jumped to the trans racial\nI said I think you're going to get a lot of blowback from a lot of black leaders out there standing wait a minute so you can be whatever race you want whenever you want to be it and I thought that was really interesting I Wonder if people thought that that was just a ... a lot of minorities might have seen that and said okay\nMaybe this time for me to get on a different mindset as to where the Democrats are going\nTo the extent that challenges so what does this fight for a week yeah was it all in vain yeah right\nNo that's I I think that's the question that that many of us have been asking for a long time I mean when you think of the mindset from the the the the left right now that you can be whatever you wish to be now that includes gender or race\nSo there because there's transgender as ... there's also trans racial Islam and they want you to believe well if you'd that's how you identify will hold on a second\nBecause if you look at a you know the the the civil rights are protected groups created under the civil rights act [noise] if there if you can belong if anyone can belong to any protected group\nThen there are just by saying so then there are no protected groups [noise]\nSend the civil rights era is done it's over I I mean the the the civil rights act but everything that the civil rights era sets happen they're all that entire battle it's we're not [noise]\nAnd not only that ... into the um\nThe civil war was for a new fight against other oppressive a governmental systems there are no why did we fight you know just to say oh it's not that we should have done that uh we're we're on another different paths now so I'm like no\nWe are Americans this or the ... we're not saying that we're at the vigil was better than anybody or any of the country for say a\nOh we are America this with America we're not saying that we're at the vigil was better than anybody or any of the country for say our ideas are better than everybody else is or any other country\nYes and then and and and the goal would be to everybody to adapt the actual ideas in in in the constitution where they\nThey don't always do so and the other thing is too I mean there's also this thing that the left throws at the conservatives and at the right that you do you want to acknowledge racism come on and we all know what are how horrendous\nRacism and slavery and Jim Crow was and I don't know any conservative but which is to go back to that\nAnd my belief is the Democrats and I think about my grandfather my grandfather was the ... the Democratic chairman of the town that we grew up in and he was because he emigrated from Canada and he came to town and they were all Republican and he just said well you got to have two parties you can have a system with but he was he was much much more conservative\nBut he left the Democrat that ball I I Believe\nMy father never had the official conversation with them about it and he died before I got to ask him\nBut I said ... be a Democrat today and he said no abortion abortion changed him a lot of the liberal politics or changed him but\nWhen you think of what they what the Republicans the Democrats used to claim in the seventies and eighties they cared about\nAnd then the identity politics where everything is about race everything is about gender and the whole cabinet thing where you saw that you must believe a woman well that's ridiculous if you must believe the woman will it used to be it must leave the white man over the black\nYou know over over the black person in a criminal justice in the black person you don't believe in the white person you believe you know you go by evidence and what I find in credit is what I find incredible as the bigotry and intolerance and the actual racism and sexism seems not to be coming from the Democrats\nWill go talk to black man about\nThat situation I'm fully understand\nThat a ... member it was all white lady that was several years ago she ran away and uh she blamed it on to black males as so every\nBlack widow that within the city it okay to buy their scrutiny and it came out that she just wanted to run away right now so\nI'm like well you have to understand that that\nIf you go to that system would be fully aware of that what you're trying to fight against for which ...\nFrames a thank you so much a Sandy some shade right started for ...\nAnd uh yeah I mean you're not the first person who was called the show and said look I'm black try being me I'm a conservative and live my life\nWell you know what's interesting too is that you go through the day to day experiences and we hear that from callers uh every so often and and I think of and then you mentioned the signs in the yard I have a a a a neighbor or has been my neighbor for almost Fifteen Years\nAt the end of my street he's so he's at the corner he's got a corner lot right\nAnd one of the free of that corner not not our street but the the the cross street there\nIs a is six lanes so there's a lot of traffic but he has a cruise sign and another conservative that's running on the state level for for a for Congress here um that is our our our congressmen on the state level\nAnd I just I just wonder I haven't asked me because I haven't had a chance to talk to him he's a black conservative and I haven't had a chance to ask him has anybody ever tried to steal your science I mean not that they would know he's black and and that that would even matter to anybody on the left but you see the things on social media\nAs anyone ever tried to steal your signs you know from your guard because he has them right there on the on the side where the big street is and so I don't know I I Would love to to know that if if anyone's ever attempted that he's he's always working in my yard I you know I I think the\nAh a\nGroup that the president spoke to the young black leadership summit mhm and the response is that you got in the media coverage of it\nAnd James like our our last caller and this is striking fear I'm not saying there is a monumental change in in a blacks going to vote Republican but they're much higher profile now and getting much more coverage the left\nCannot permit that they must demonize every single person who would tend to do that because you're talking about a solid demographic base that they have held for a long time a long time you have a long long time\nEight six six Ninety read I\nWas ... radio\nThat they have held for a long time
