A. R. K. I. S. L. E. R.\nA. O. L. dot com\nSo tonight there there are a lot of news stories I Want to talk to you about but one of the things which ties in to the other night is the Democrats are made it very clear\nThat they're poised to draft articles impeachment with the Washington Post ABC reporting that nearly fifty percent of Americans support immediate impeachment hearing so of course we got to take these polls lightly we know her on the polls were last time I think there are only two that protected President Trump would win and become president\nSo they're trying to keep the somewhat under the radar because they know many moderate and conservative voters would vote against their Canada age if they knew what they were up to if they knew\nAs I pointed out the next two years of going to be chaos if they win the house of representatives subpoena power a hearings impeachment hearings they'll start on off after Trump of course they're going to go for taxes don't go to get Kevin on it's gonna be a disaster if they win\nAnd my you may remember this minority leader Schumer during a parade he denied that this is what he thought he was asked talking about impeachment when he said the sooner the better later on and so I thought they were asked me when we'd get rid of a Trump and minority leader posts\nTalking about a peach men when he said the sooner the better later on even though I thought they were asked me when we'd get rid of a Trump\nAnd minority leader Pelosi said it's not a priority now all of something else comes forward\nBut of course Maxine Waters has no such restraints calling continuously for the impeachment uh forty five she thinks that's a genius line 'cause that's about all if you know Maxine Waters I Know of her and I met her that's that's about her intelligence level as bad as she can go\nBut by the way as I said last night and us ties it altogether\nI think they're all wasting their time they're delusional President Trump is going to be reelected they're going to be so

student\nI'm not sure about the math students I think the same rules apply can you imagine that you you've got to be so concerned about and this relates to what we've been talking about that someone will accuse you of something that you didn't do\nAnd and their teachers all the time and choose the things that they didn't do we call in Los Angeles the I think rubber room the good news they get paid the same amount so they sit around for months they sit around for years is the bad news you can get rid of a bad teacher if they did do something bad\nBut if they didn't you couldn't be accused of anything and everything and it happens all the time and where do you go as I said the other night where do you go to get your reputation back\n... this this whole politically correct movement is as

I think one I Would want to have coffee with is\nA tight as now she ran for governor hearing loss by only two hundred vote to show [noise] and it was a school teacher in a sense of a woman\nAnd I I really do think that in the tide is good to prove of all the dirty tricks and terrible things that Democrats are doing there's just no way and I predict she's going to switch party affiliations shouldn't his pitch to\nElections stealth is over because I'm sure Paul there's a lot of this is that it's just not acceptable and she was raised better than that I Know so yeah that was going to have caught the it was so indeed Dana as there's just no way in the world shaken approve of any of it is okay\nWell except for one thing the I appreciate your call didn't follow the rules the game boys you had to pick someone running for president\nIt is well except for one thing any I appreciate your call didn't follow the rules the game was you had to pick someone running for president not that I Know her and I didn't know some of the other candidates running I certainly didn't know them well\nBut the the game was you had to pick someone who's running for president and say who you would sit down and have coffee with an eye on the other gentleman agreed me Bernie Sanders I\nThat's I think he's the head right now so we got to hear your votes let us know what you think an eight six six Ninety red eye for right now you have your national forecast or video road block\nWhether highlights around the nation today persistent rain is expected for the next few days over Texas where excessive rain as possible and the central part of the state ... over the higher elevations of Arizona and New Mexico is expected to spread northward into the central Rockies\nTemperatures twenty to forty degrees below normal from the southern plains\nEnd of the southern rocky thunder persistent clouds and ...

wouldn't argue with you on that could you sit down to Geneva Republican you could sit down and don't count Bloomberg that you could sit down and have a cup of coffee with\nUh quite frankly very few and far between I Would say that a Lindsey Lindsey Graham strikes me as a very profound man he's a\nHe's a really decent guy and he's he's got a heart and he's got he's got a mine and he's got a compassion for for the people at this country a he's a he's a Republican correct so yeah you know I I I I Would think that\nIdeally he'd make a crazy pie minimum at minimum you'd make or break the are supposed to a ... you know I mean\nLook at Trump Trump is already wise you chose a as as as the tea and it's it's great insurance ... behind you sew anything ever God Forbid goes dramatically raunchy cameras all you got it you've got a man who could step into your shoes and probably do just as well as you\nWell you run your very articulate and you are blind challenge to for a Republican you did very well so I appreciate your call and you have a great night thanks so much and let's go to because ah yeah we have time right you can in ways that Hammond, Indiana\n[noise] yeah I wanted to speak to the question of of prosecuting Hillary Clinton [noise] um ... you don't win much ruin world\nOh if you lose an election you out one or two choices you leave the country or you go to jail or worse\nRight are are more reason we're a stable democracy is because there are certain political norms that we don't like\nAll remember a set aside the the the possibilities Democrats going through ten years of Donald Trump's tax returns after he leaves office all think back to the Bush administration a lot of people both at the enhanced interrogation was unlawful\nRight so so we don't I don't think we want to get into a pattern or the incoming administration prosecutes the leader the leaders of the ... the former administration leaders of the other party\nBecause our our politics have become too hostile as idiots we need to take a step back and understand that there are certain traditions that are critical all through our are having a stable democracy that we have and rule of law is only one of the\n... well that's an interesting point because it you know a lot of people and the other side I think he shouldn't be above the law\nBut as you point out that she has a unique position of also having been the opposing candidate which of course doesn't explain what to do what what what they what wait a second what the FBI and the Justice Department there was a soft to try to get rid of the incoming president\nSo this is a very complicated situation and she said to his ...\nHis Justice Department though but I Will give you one ... my point after the civil war right the Confederate Sam ... committed treason could obviously committed treason yet we did not try to lock them up because it was more important than the rule of law that we come back to get\nGood at what point can I say you know I said he may not hurt me I said whoever talks in the last I didn't quite say that but that's what I was thinking on this issue with Hillary a you made a good point and that that's a great point with the civil war I preach oh who could you have coffee with on the other side or a silent when\nIt probably I Would probably lean toward a Ben Sasse\nUh-huh and he's bright guy yeah he's he's things things are good you did you pass the test did very well thanks so much here I Am\nStand with Walker cross that have you ever watch Fox News got these people answering questions in the news that's kind of dumb but this is interesting because who'd you get along with people the way it used to be with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan you get along with people on the opposing party and and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them speaking\nDylan Ronald Reagan you get along with people of the opposing party in and get away from the politics for a little while because you would least respected them the speaking of respecting levels go to live in Pittsburgh Lynn you're on was mark\nWell you know I had a rude\nAwakening this morning I uh I woke up and my radio was still on and I heard righteous Joe\nAnd his a dissertation on how I'm basically he can shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue and and why you should be able to get away with it um\nBut as Hillary is concerned um I kind of signed on to the previous caller just right before me [noise] um if she really had broken the law and been found guilty\nThen certainly she should be locked up [noise] um but right just Joe that sounded like a polluted twisted demonic rant\nAnd it when I hear people like him talking it makes me wish that the Native Americans in this country had bars on the shores of this country to keep his mask the lazy hateful\nAncestors out of this country\nI Would like to have coffee I wait on on the other side I'm\nEven though I disagree with most of her politics um as a progressive myself that would be a Lisa Murkowski\nBecause that woman she's a she's a strong woman she's she's an example to to to women on my side uh\nNo that's a woman with some integrity and character and strength\n... and she's a bad ass\nWould you have said that if she voted for Kavanaugh's nomination\nNo I'm thinking about some of her actions over a period of time I remember when when uh there was a little spray with Trump and I'm a she says she wasn't going to live in fear of a tweet\nWow that really knocked me back I was really impressed with that so she showed that she's a she's a woman of strength\nCharacter and she's not going to be bullied by anybody on on either side so\nBefore I let you go who's your choice who is your choice of the Democratic nomination\nWell I haven't decided yet I Would like for some of the old you know the old timers to just step aside\nA here in my a state that we've we we have someone that a lot of people were liking a his name as Conor Lamb and I really like for you know you know like for more people like him the rides\nAnd I don't want to see Joe Biden run again\nUm I think that he had a history of saying some stupid things and and uh\nIt uh I I Would not like to see him run again a he's a good guy but\nUm you know some of these people just need to step out of the way and a lot of new crop of progress it's a pump through\nYeah great point Lynn I appreciate your call a especially on the other side by the way saying talking about stepping aside so you got Nancy Pelosi in her seventies\nCliburn I think his third in line Sonny ... in his seventies their own there's nothing wrong with that except for ah she was saying a lot of people would like there was an article about I don't know for the times where it was about people stepping aside for the younger generation problem is in the house if you serve in the house\nAnd you don't shirk committee you're just like it is not a very\nUh what can I say a interesting life to lead you know I mean I'd love to be a congressman viewpoints me tomorrow is on what I'm saying but uh compared to the other positions there\nBut the Democrats have that problem to\nLet me know what your thinks we're asking to questions who is your choice to run against a President Trump and who could just sit down and have a cup of coffee with you guys are surprised me it

to you again on law I wanted to go\nBack to something you said earlier I Believe you're referring to something somebody said about a dozen times that we live in and [noise] I hear that a lot and it's not that I'm trying to argue with you or disagree with you but I think we're looking at it in a different sense that\nI think it's not really that I don't think that's the case I think it's more it's the media so embolden and they're out there they don't care now that I've been trying to hide what tests that they believe in\nAnd they don't care [laughter] and so because of that they they get so many we find that people that just buy into that garbage and that's why they have this perception of this is the times we live and and but it's not really that I think it's just the media is so abusive but I Want to get your take on that\nYeah you while you you made a point I should have brought up thank you Daniel Lee the influence of the media right first of all they don't hide how they feel I don't know why I think of an entertainer when I used to watch Johnny Carson so\nUh I never knew his political point of view I suspect he was a Democrat or liberal but he never had it out there now again he was a comedian\nWas but the media is such a powerful role because so many people that's all they hear right the major news channels not so much right now that we have more the blogs and the Internet and all that stuff talk radio\nBut the place to be role and they have an agenda who's the guy from CNN or like the character that it's always trying to get something on Trump I Can't even think of his name but they ...\nI don't want their land [laughter] want to say that they may not and\nI and my ... and you know I mean right and he wants to publicity and they don't you're right and I there is any more they don't hide they act like as a kid and they're not journalists over the\nProblem I have with it is is that this is supposed\nTo be a country that has room for all people are all

that's not what America's top [noise]\nI got to answer your but I've got aunts my producer who just told me he said the Anderson Cooper no 'cause I thought of Jim Acosta and you didn't want me to give publicity but that's the guy and he loves it it's about\nAnd so I'm playing right into it you know the name I Know you didn't but I'm showing my producing doesn't have it because he's told me to [laughter] wrong but there there's so many of these actors right right they they want to take on the role of being a powerful\n... told me to [laughter] wrong but there's so many of them he's actors
