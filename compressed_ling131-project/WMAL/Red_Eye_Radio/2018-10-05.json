Ford or to the FBI\nTo have hurt therapy notes from two thousand twelve and no no no no she didn't know she did I tell you\nWell she did and I mean not all that is what she did not want back she was holding back the notes from that there is from the FBI\nNo no she was holding them back to the Senate not from\nThe offer her from the Senate yes at the same thing there's no difference\nNo no there is a big difference ... than it is let's say prior to send the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWell no you can give it to the Democrats then you give it to the Democrats and then they ... and they present it and the people get to see it the FBI or what you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything on the ground with a ... once in a criminal matter it was a background check they in\nFact what the FBI would deal with it would be put it into the three oh two white which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have\nThat's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI innocent tire equation I just to give the Senate the information\nYou're making it sound like the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway\nThat's in fact the only purpose the FBI serves in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\nIf I mean she would officially be dip putting it into the three oh two has she done that during the process and the way I agreed to take out the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice his call for it\nAnd uh it's a Feinstein of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to them so they didn't do go that way no\nSo it's a useless conversation\nAnd and anyone and if if that would if forwards if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that a and forged assuming for its lawyers are telling the truth again they're trying to circumvent the system\nSo the information will get out but won't be in the three oh two after because of the background check the ...\nBut again they're trying to circumvent the system\nSo the

as you could\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation\nI don't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will claimed ooh that's a challenge is not right I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting because that was the key of\nLook at the last sentence with recently uncovered mission please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect contact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein and Hirono other than a year communications with me and my staff member\nMy step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford leaving them Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and\nA deadly re mirrors Julie sweat neck or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter sent yesterday [noise]\nSo it was like I said in the last caller brought up was she was willing to turn them over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was when I when I said no it's like because our point is to go directly to the Senate to begin with data there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary\nCommittee kind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see that the the only by senators\nWas said the only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence and she wants to people who said she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide\nGive it to Grassley indirectly\nOutside of the three oh two because then the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak it\nExactly\nOr\nGenerating we wait for us just released the entire right to the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\nBecause they're not political [laughter]\nOkay that's a really ... the Washington Post and the wall street\nJournal [noise] no I mean from you know from the west point of view and and that was the the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not well neither is the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... let me see that ah when was that sense here in front of you were okay 'cause that letter must have been late last night to shed and Bream a pulse uh ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the um uh Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure is interesting\nAbout I'm pleased let us know your please give to us you know what you have shared with Feinstein in her own oh\nWhoa mhm\nBecause of uncovered evidence so what do they have\nRight and what what is what is that what is that one about so again I'm we're getting into stupid area again we're getting into areas you know with the lawyers state and they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense\nThen yeah it's a demand that doesn't even a demand that within a demand that would ensure if you went through it that way that the nodes would never become public right you would never know what was in the ...\nThey would not because of the Senate rule see the light of day\nIf you want this public there's plenty of ways to do

witnesses as well as supporting materials sudden by the witnesses during their interviews\nAmong those question where mark judge PJ Smith Leland Kaiser that three individuals Christine Ford claimed were president when Kavanaugh allegedly through or on the bed and sexually assaulted her some time in the Nineteen eighties\nAh all all three of those individuals had already provided statements to

summary [laughter] well\nWhat's interesting here is that it was likely going to happen anyway but you mentioned this uh believe it was yesterday on the program and and we were we were wondering\nIn this process because of the rule the Senate rule that keeps the details and those three oh two reports a secret and can be viewed only by a hundred people\nThe there is going to be inevitably there is going to be a a summary overall to tell us essentially gay or nay if there is something new there or something more to this investigation other words something to substantiate the claims by Dr Ford and ...\nAnd that summary of you if you look at it by the the Judiciary Committee is basically\nI think in part works to the effect of as you mentioned yesterday would they be trying to get some of this information out so the Democrats don't have the claim that this wasn't a thorough background check the facts of the matter is you're not going to you're only going to interview people were first hand knowledge\nOr people that were said to have had first hand knowledge anyone else isn't going to be included in that process the point being\nThe leftist screaming all day long on Thursday which

convicted wrongly accused\nThe presumption of innocence is always the ... the number one thing that evidence is what determines whether you're guilty they existed or used to exist to protect people's

we all know that's the one the the ACLU before it was taken over by partisans like whew once defended capital has not been so toning them together is by definition guilt by association and unfair do

soon that\nYou're saying he's entitled to the job and I'm not real but hold on I'm not arguing that I'm asking\nYou why you put him next to a man who was tied in court and conviction of felonies and sentenced to\nPrison because they didn't have any of those things that individual also denied the accusations I think he would appreciate Tucker that we're criticizing people on the left and I don't care about the left in the right I care about fairness and wants to make the country was when she wants to do it now you hear an eight on\n\nSexual assault has taken very seriously here a talker and I

executive summary\nUh released a in fact it was early this morning it was released actually wasn't late last night according to this report\nThe request was for an investigation into the uh current credible allegations against justice Kavanaugh reads the report released by Chuck Grassley the summary stage\nThat the FBI investigators reached out this is from the Washington Examiner by the way the summary states that the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses\nWith potential first hand knowledge of the allegation\nSo there it is the FBI investigators reached out to all witnesses with potential first hand knowledge of the allegations we've heard from a the ... lawyers that mono she had twenty people she wanted them to talk to them all they cared about was anybody that potentially had\nFirst hand knowledge not hearsay right where are you there right can you back up before we go any further investigation can you backup that this actually happened\nInvestigator spoke with six people in an effort to cooperate the allegations against Kavanaugh\nBy California professor ah Christine Blasey Ford who testified in front of the committee that Kavanaugh had held her down put his hand over her mouth and tried to remove her clothes at a party in Maryland while the two were in high school in eighty two those witnesses include mark judge Leyland ties are PJ a Smith\nA Timothy ...

supposedly had and they went through all the witnesses that potentially had first hand knowledge and no cooperation to get yeah right\nAnd and that's again the [noise] when when you look at it\nThere was nothing was going to change here nothing was going to change this gets back to the one thing they wanted to do all the long\nDelayed delayed delight with the outside hope of having either Kavanaugh himself or the president withdraw the nomination\nAnd that wasn't going to happen I mean the the the the louder the less got the the greater or I guess the stronger a foothold got by the

senator he's a he's a congressman oh and the district in El Paso oh I don't know I'm thinking I don't want to take his place or\nA Democrat and better work said he's not interested in endorsement from President block Obama is the attempt to unseat Ted Cruz in the midterms in\nIraq was speaking after a town hall in local high school when addressed and he addressed the unsettling fact that Obama has endorsed eleven Texas Democrats not including himself I don't think we're interested he's setting the endorsement right\nI'm so grateful for him for a service is going to go down as one of the greatest presidents\nAnd yet this election is on Texas\nHuh so there you go [laughter] well\nIt it's again you can take the money from the liberals outside of the state but you you cannot uh bring it in because here's what he knows a couple of things [laughter] uh many people\nEspecially people in the middle and and on the right who are going to vote for him anyway but the the ones in the middle who just might\nOr would be many of them turned off by\nPeople in the middle and and on the right who are going to vote for him anyway but the the ones in the middle who\nJust might a would be many of them turned off by\nObama but beyond that when you look at Obama and his effect on the left it doesn't hurt at all that old Rourke turns him down what does that tell you about Obama and his influence on the left\nAnd the fact that it doesn't matter you can publically say I don't want us endorsement right doesn't affect anybody at all you have you ever seen a lot but the DNI likes nana I settled by thinking about ten years ago right now but well think about\nGoing back I don't know go back to um you know the post just after the Clinton years so go back to the mid term of two thousand to write and imagine someone said that then of a Bill Clinton and Bill Clinton you know wasn't the deity that Obama was\nBut\nStill in a situation like that back then that would have been done behind closed doors right\nIf somebody on the left was like yeah listen ah you know we're trying to just do this on our own uh you know you know maybe the the voters won't react positively to Bill Clinton being you know as a ... an endorsement on on the ticket now you can just open we say\nYeah we're we're ... we're over Obama\nWe don't need\nI mean really it's it is the major major\nHe's yesterday's news desk but it's the major blue states\nWhere he gets applauded but the question is does he really happening usefulness to the party itself if you think about the the like when he uh gave us a list of in endorsements remember who is back and when that came out mhm\n[noise] kinda like his bracket used to be [laughter] but it really kind of had the same political impact as actually I could say this is bracket used to get more news\n[noise] [noise] right well on ESPN it did not know ... and ... ... no I don't get ... well yeah that was a surprise for different reasons yes it was yeah yeah yeah um [laughter] no way out of you let's not get political by bringing ESPN and right and I I mean you got huge news no it\nWas and and the endorsement list really I mean it came out and made his rounds but it really didn't go any further from that there hasn't been that presence you know by Obama and that might be his choice\nI mean they've been saying what they hanging out I did see the stories here's what he's reading this summer nobody cares\nNo one cares I remember that story no one key here's what's on his reading list shows them you know on a on a couch you know somewhere probably in Martha's Vineyard\nNo body cares but it hasn't been the political impact\nIn that part is I mean for the right it's kind of been that way for a while George W. Bush kind of went off and then he retired he really didn't say a lot\nHey I have a question there's just popped into my mind young day and you just be made you just reignited the the flame and my brain ... ah Dershowitz mentioned uh Martha's Vineyard yesterday and buy something known as a liberal island yeah right are there any conservative violence\n[laughter] [laughter]\nThat exactly an island but [laughter] it's about as close as we can get or for conservatives go from all over the world to hang out together you know there's some thing because you don't get what he said he's not welcome snow Dershowitz said he's not welcome on Martha's Vineyard I actually asked this question in my mind uh because a\nFriend a well I actually someone in the house was watching something where there was um\nThere was this area and it was clear in this area it was all liberals they were it was part of reality t._v. show but the the based on the things that people were saying and show it was clearly a liberal and I kinda thought thought of Martha's Vineyard because it kind of had that appeal looked like that right\nAnd I thought to myself there isn't a conservative place like that [laughter] and there really isn't [laughter] I mean because\nI don't know I mean you don't I'd well we don't look for safe spaces [laughter]\nHey I'm honored by water is such a safe [laughter] you really have to make an effort to get their Martha's Vineyard the safe space for the elite liberal well there's the thing too it's only about the rich liberal so rich that ridge elite liberal your eyes\nAll right I understand now yeah okay thank you I had to clarify that in my all my life right to work that through 'cause after you brought it up\nElite liberal you're right\nAll right I understand now yeah okay thank you I had to clarify that in my on my leg right of work that through 'cause after you brought it up and I heard ... which you know there there was asked yesterday about you know I go to Martha's Vineyard I Can't even associate with those people anymore I mean they they rejected me and like when you're talking about places like it's", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington", "day": "05"}
