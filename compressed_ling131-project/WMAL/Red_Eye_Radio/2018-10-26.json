good and we got a very busy show for this Friday we do extremely busy latest on the suspicious packages of questions still out there were they lied bombs or not it's really amazing\nGoing through the different news stories yesterday right from you know you can go to one new story and it will say uh you know lie bombed you go to another one say a suspicious package will go to another one that says [noise]\nPotentially explosive uh uh uh packages you'll get the you know the tweet from the FBI that were you know treating these as potential you know potentially explosive devices and dangerous devices\nA Sheryl ... uh you know CBS News\nShe's been following it and her latest one is look nobody has said these were actually lied bombs that could have gone off\nA officially earlier she had a a written this goes back about seven hours ago she had written\nOr the fact that you know law enforcement has not said that any of them are and then she uh uh clarified it a couple of hours ago and said now they're you know they're still calling them\nSuspicious packages and write potentially suspicious packages and I think it's important and I you know you just you just wonder\nI mean now we and we'll get into this year and a little bit now you know we know the trail they're down in Florida but I think the other plane you know looking at the New Jersey whatever you're getting all these leaks\nRight but nobody has leaked really one of the most important things which would it would give would give ah you you would think the media would want the opportunity to go down different paths right right and so my first question would be where they live bombs or not but they were potentially explosive devices that doesn't tell me anything\nWell and and what I don't see here is this uh this this over abundance of of of caution in a warning when we go back to a several months to the Austin bombings you saw the authorities in that area\nYou know because they didn't know what they were dealing with right they were talking about how people in the Austin area\nShouldn't approach or any kind of package on their porch or even their own porch\nEspecially something they didn't order or anything else they had to be very careful about now\nOn their porch or even their own porch\nEspecially something they didn't order or anything else they had to be very careful about now there have been some you know the alerts out there but for something like what's going on right now if we were looking I think if you're looking at live bombs especially the fact that\nYou know is that the worst things anybody has ever said\nAh no\nNo but ... ask Roseanne Barr how much you have to say ... probably Roseanne Barr that situation was much more serious in terms of of how it was viewed in Hollywood than what Megan Kelly said I I don't know\nI ... I don't know I my two my two conspiracy theories and but once you know initially they weren't going to\nInitially they weren't going to fire that wasn't in their plans with initially just for that for what she said they weren't going to do it as you said in our personal meaning\nYou figure it out it's just better till after Halloween [noise] see I come back after Halloween but but then they went oh wait a minute hold it she's not producing yeah don't wait a minute rating we can get out of his contract we can we wow one of the lawyer said you know this could be caused and if we get it for cause we don't have to pay off her contract that's one side of it the other side of it as\nMy other conspiracy theories making Kelly was thinking I don't want to be doing this is just totally sucks but I don't want to be able to collect my contract let me say something that's maybe a little bit controversial but not far enough for them to justify all the fire me for cars [laughter]\nWhat I mean and if they try I can still collect\nHere's the difference Megan Kelly saying that on her old show on Fox News would have just been another night of making Kelly he wouldn't have heard complaints\nI may be I mean on social media you would've yes but it wouldn't have been treated the same\nI mean she may have had to follow up and say you know hey that's not what I meant it's not okay or whatever but it wouldn't have been what it is that NBC for a morning show there's a big difference in in in the type of a audience that you have there\nSo who knows what will happen but ah yeah maybe maybe it was amicable\nBy both parties also coming up Chuck Grassley referring Michael ... sweat next to the department of justice for possible criminal action ... for making false statements about cabinet ... that would be interesting to see where that goes yeah the progress of the caravan eight hundred troops will be heading apparently to the border will get to that\nChuck Todd I fear the Russians could be behind the mail bomb scare and the New York times publishing that Trump assassination fantasy you heard about that yeah yeah\nThat's a yeah that's bizarre and it's okay to publish that especially with what's going on huh yeah All right it was a fantasy\nWorld ... it's how ... how would the Russian collusion thing and so yeah it was your fantasy yeah eight six six Ninety red eyes\nBug you read our radio with a record ...

six Ninety or read I welcome and good morning also coming up we'll tell you about the the story in the wall Street Journal they actually took the Commerce Department numbers\nAnd figured out that a significant portion half of almost half of the increase of the GDP since\nApril of last year or the acceleration of you know it's going from roughly two point two percent\nAnnual growth for the last few years under Obama\nTo from the middle of last year to right now a two point nine percent half\nAlmost half of that growth just under half ... uh is because of government increased government spending defense spending federal spending increased state and local spending you and I've talked about the flaws of the GDP\nCry you know and it's the only thing that you can go by so you go buy it and not that there wasn't government spending before but they looked at the acceleration of the increase in spending\nA over the last year and said that is cause for half of it and the reason that it's important as you know we look at you know everything in an economy and what might affect that\nWe look at the good portions that we've seen we've also looked at the things that can hurt the economy the the terrorists the increased because of that the increase in cost of of timber and steel and materials\nOr the you know the the housing a a a slowdown so over the the the last a month a government\nAt times believes that they can and people believe the government can help the economy\nAt the same time manipulated into success by picking winners and losers and they can't\nLook not that there's anything wrong with increasing defense spin around out there um but what we want to do is set that aside and look at where the growth is and isn't in the private sector\nBecause the the ... what creates well what really moves the economy is the new goods and services that are produced by the private sector and the GDP a lotta times takes in government spending and the transfer of money as actual economic growth and it is not right up\nEight six six Ninety red eye if you want to join us for the bona show for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nAre finally breaking the rains

over the state rain has moved to the east and we'll see it run today from I fifty five and I sixty five north and south\nAt a good part of the mid west and south will see showers today most about Seventy five will look to see rain later in the day it'll be clear in the northeast the desert southwest and dry in the nation's midsection and western parts of the country with the exception of coastal Washington and Oregon and the Northern Rockies\nNow we know it's also not nearly as important as if someone on the left up here is like they might have been injured by someone who everyone they won it was so almost all the like but nobody really knows and so I guess in the colleges they start teaching something like that that's actually quite victim status so they can help straighten us all out and you\nHave that [laughter] well you know my hair Eric you were talking about what's at the tweet\nWas a Donald Trump junior the put it out earlier yeah Donald Trump junior making some very good points on social media uh yesterday Thursday and and I think on Wednesday as well\nSaying well where was the call for civility when someone sent fake rice and to his residence and and it was you know that got ultimately close to to his wife it was intended for him Donald Trump junior and the same thing happened to his brother he was asking uh I forget who was he was asking\nUh in in that tweet he was responding to somebody else's tweet um but that's that's the whole thing is that there was no call for civility when that happened I mean you see a number of things have happened or that and with any president or presidential family but especially this well\nYou've had how much you know that has happened and been sad um and we have to point out\nBecause Gary laid it out a and thank you my\nFor the call a this was several months ago\nBut you're talking about when you call someone\nHitler what the threat is\nThen we were talking about civility then that was the setting yes and the media was you know talking about well civility and civility we'll wait a minute when you compare to someone to a arguably one of the worst\nMass murderers and history pure evil\nYou are saying the threat to someone is that guy is capable this person is just like Adolf Hitler and his capable of doing the same heinous thing and when you do that that becomes a threat\nThat that you're saying that this person\nIn this case the president is the same kind of threat that Hitler was and that's the ultimate threats\nSo the call for civility and the media pretending like this is all on the president you got to give me a break rhetoric is one thing comparing him to a mass murderer that one of the most evil people to ever exist on earth\nThat's very different [noise] uh not only Hitler but when they combine Hitler with fascist and the ... or ... mindset yeah Donald Trump which has to be a dictator as we said nothing indicate set in anything that he has done in any of his executive orders anything that he has fought from the court's everything\nHas in in my opinion but let me All right let me say this Ninety nine point nine percent of what he has has of what he was promoted maybe somebody can find one percent and make an argument\nThat that will be willing to listen to so I I don't want to say one hundred percent ... so Ninety nine point nine percent of what Donald Trump is best promoted or his rhetoric may offend you\nBy his provocative nature may uh uh offend you but what does he actually does does he deserved is it fair to relate him to one of the worst mass murderers\nGenocidal mass murderers in the history of the world right is that even close to any type of accurate portrayal no is pure demonization and inflammatory rhetoric and what is it designed to do\nIt is designed to create range in the people that will believe you fear and rage age is not an attempt to have a discussion on the policies of the president\nWell let's look at this and is that too much government intervention no it's Hitler it's the same as the guy who\nAre committed a genocide of six million human beings in concentration camps that's what Donald Trump is he's a fascist let's throw most selenium there to well what you know ... let's combine Hitler was Mussolini\nAnd let's combine the worst\nAny in there to well what you know ... let's combine Hitler was Mussolini and less combined the worst\nEvil people that have ever existed and say that as Donald Trump ...\nWell of course that's just the most bizarre and inflammatory things that you could possibly say and\nThe other point that we made over the last couple of days is after the Steve Scully shooting\nA going after the the I Can't think of his name right now but the man who was a a you know a supporter of of uh of Bernie Sanders who attempted to assassinate members of Congress if it wasn't for the Capitol police you probably would have quite a few dead Republican Congress people right now ...\nAh they came to the defense and we're we're able to stop that that situation Steve Sebelius represent 'em ...\nSeriously injured did that change the rhetorical nature the inflammatory rhetorical nature of Democrats at all or have they ... it up\nTo the point of as we saw with Kavanaugh auditor insanity over the last couple of months\nThat reality is it's not going to stop\nLive we live in a nation of free speech and people are are going to go to the limit of their of of of free speech and they're going to go to the ... that's just what happens\nIn our society we may not like it people may view it as an civil but it's the reality of where we live and what is the thing that will temper that but we'll temper that is if they continue to lose elections Americans must reject\nMust reject that and it gets to the it gets to that point and so you know we we have talked about you know also the morality of the media\nAnd and this is that we think extremely important when you look at Donald Trump being accused of treason\nThe Russian collusion almost two years of it never ending pounding by the media\nAnd they sit there you know when Sarah Sanders defense and said look it's it's been ... the the law is against this president coming from the media had been never ending right\nThe source stories that have been inaccurate that you hide behind your sources say well this is what our sources told us well if you care if it's not true and you can't prove it's true you don't always believe your sources well it\nYou know you have or the remember the indictments that came down with Papadopoulos and Manafort and the president tweeted that day\nYou know no collusion\nAnd then the New York times article that said he was tweeting that as they were proving collusion something to that effect nope nope\nNo ... and that's false that that is a blatant lie or complete incompetence either you don't belong at any you don't belong on Twitter if you're if you're putting that kind of if you're a reporter putting that kind of\nBS out much less a major newspaper because there was no proof none stills none\nTo this day nothing and you have what a false narrative that has gone on and still goes on and no one knows what more has in front of him know\nThat may change\nWhat what hasn't changed I'll tell you right now is the false narrative\nWell think about this it was just a couple of months ago in front of the White House remember they were there for days because of Russian collusion right and trees and the president now we have the midterms it's not even a topic of discussion right it's like okay we can't go anywhere with this lie that we have perpetuated for the last\nTwo years so let's move on to something something else and then they they attempt to walk away as if well no we bear no responsibility for the instability that happens today or the heightened inflammatory rhetoric that exist today were completely innocent were just reporting\nOn we're just where everybody knows everybody else it's a bunch of crap right the only thing we're doing is telling you that uh she got\nThere illegally he came to power illegally and with the help of another major nation\nThat is the uh that that in terms of nukes\nIs the only match really for the United states on the planet in terms of a threat\nAh he is he works for the Russians\nHe's friendly with the Russians he's a fascist and he's capable of killing as Hitler was\nIt was just a couple of months ago we had followed the survey for the last over year\nAnd he's capable of killing at Hitler\nWas remember it was just a couple of months ago we had followed the survey for the last ... over a year ... that showed that the majority of Democrats still believe that the Russians hacked into the election machines and twenty six team\nYeah and we have a um an election coming up in what eleven days yeah\nAnd ah and where they screaming about that it's gone silent now why is that\nIf you want to get in lines are open now

Washington comes to talking\nHave humming I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or read I welcome and a good morning I\nYou know I Wonder whether the whole caravan thing is going to move into the background and we were you and I talked about this when it first you know most about a week ago was first started that uh when we came back from vacation and\nWe saw the you know we saw social media\nAnd a lot of Republicans were saying well this they're doing this in order to affect election day yeah and you and I came in and said wait a minute when you see how far away they are and how far they can walk in one day I'm not going to get here to weigh after election day so really this is going to hurt them this is not going to\nHelp the the Democrats are and I saw the story that the president you know plans on sending you know eight hundred troops down to the border\nWasn't as big of a stories I thought it would be and I wonder that over the past week at the media has looked at this and said this isn't going to benefit us\nLet's bring it up after the midterms fry we believe this is actually helping Trump right and so since this isn't really going to say this is only gonna hurt as before the midterm let's sort of berry this story a little bit or not give it the emphasis that we were giving it before\n[noise] yeah I mean it's it ... it is the the um the the the political tool at the moment right so if there is a greater political tool than you kind of jumped to that\nAnd we'll see where the story goes with the you know suspicious devices or whatever we're calling them now I'm over I suspect that if if they know\nWhere these things are being mailed from there it will only be a matter of time if if if not hours before they find out or at least know with a person might be\nUm ... and and even apprehend them someone had said on Thursday morning was watching some of the coverage and a one law enforcement I'm a expert not not an unofficial or investigator in the case but\nAn expert commenting said it's quite possible we could see somebody arrested are apprehended as early as today\nExpert not not an ... an official or investigator in the case but an expert commenting said it's quite possible we could see somebody arrested are apprehended as early as today and that that's just just based on how quickly it works and how much physical evidence there is in this case\nYou get that and and we find out what the motivation is I guess of the person possibly I'm assuming that they are taken alive\nAnd it becomes again I'm that\nChanges this narrative and and do you go back if you're the media or you're an operative on the left\nYou go back to the caravan um the Caribbean thing it kind of pause because of so many I guess I'm concerns along the way now you had um you know the the department of homeland security saying look you know people will be apprehended\nIt's one of the reasons that they're losing but you and I said this\nMany times all we need is truth\nAnd when you look at the things that we believe they work\nMhm that's why we promote them that's why we do the kind of show that we do we spend a lot of time talking about this yesterday that's why we break down everything that's why we get down to the issues that had and we get pushback from people on the right when we do that by the way mhm there are some not all but there are some of the right\nThat want to believe the rhetoric they want to believe the height\nYou know you and I and and that's why we talked about dictator remember when uh we would sit here Obama as a Muslim and we said where's the evidence right\nWhile his father no where's the evidence that that's what he believes if you look at what he believes what does he believe he believes more in the church of Jeremiah Wright mhm\nWhich wasn't preaching you know Islam but was preaching hay and not Christianity but was preaching a radical hate him or hate America a a\nMessage message and thank you very much [laughter] to friday or hate America message as we said come on\nIf you look at Obama certainly not religious what do you think\nThat somebody like Obama worships anybody else out there doing really really think that you really think he's a devoted that there is I got up there that tells him what to do ... please and so we had some fun with it but we said no the evidence doesn't show that at all evidence matters across the board and we've pushed back because we've done that\nAh one of the biggest push back we had was when we made fun of jade helm Fifteen remembering ... remember the number of people that called us and were furious at us\nBecause we were a mock and it was ridiculous oh the government's secret they're going to be in Texas and it sees a secret raids that are going on and and remember the tunnels and Walmart and everything else and people are jumping aboard this crap that's pure crap and you buy into it\nSeparate yourself from those idiots over their deal with the truth that's all you need to do is deal with the truth not being fantasy bizarro conspiracy theory world\nBecause everyone knows the tunnels were under target exactly [laughter] well I mean we're we're just going to start\nWith I I never forget the I'll never forget that moment in a jade helm ... Fifteen\nWhen you know it was the night we were getting barrage with phone calls\nYou guys just don't understand you don't understand what we know we know we know and that's always the argument from the conspiracy theorists oh we know something that you don't know they're more I feel special because somebody else has told me and and and I know and this is when they were talking about how top secret was and we had to bring out\nOf the uh a press release that was done\nFrom the local chamber of commerce at one of the counties that you know you were going to have the special forces in that had already figured out the economic benefit to their county frightened by for\nSomebody that was going to be spent on you know he was going to be ... be spent that's how secret it was right that the chamber of commerce had done it I mean they've spent over two million on the tunnels under Walmart alone [laughter] you know we we dealt with it and we we dealt with it after the nine eleven conspiracy bribery remember we had to go to\nWe actually had to go on the show to Popular Mechanics and these are people that listen to our show yes\nSo it for us it's a constant fight and you know what the nine eleven conspiracy theories that people were buying into I remember we had to [laughter] read portions of Popular Mechanics number Popular Mechanics said look\nI'm we do mechanics and so we weren't getting get involved in this and we realized wait a minute that's what we're here for\nThese things these theories about mechanics and physics are being put out there that's what we do let's see whether they're actually possible or not [noise] uh what was the other way we uh we dealt with it um\nWe dealt with it the night of the ... brothers\nCall man so we go on ... we had been getting\nWe dealt with it um we dealt with it the night of the Saturday off brothers oh man so we go on it we had been getting a information coming in about what was going on in ... in Watertown uh uh about thirty minutes before we went on for about eleven\nThirty central that night and we started coverage route twelve thirty when we started getting confirmation of the of those reports 'cause there there was breaking news and we we continue that coverage or through the end of the show\nSomewhere in the middle of the show we started getting emails this Boston bombing the other bottling bombing suspects and when they essentially went through water town and and uh that night that uh you know one of them died and the other one uh eventually was captured the later but when you look at the\nThe the about about I don't know halfway through the show when we looked at our email that was coming in and it was about\nWell it's it then they gave us specific names\nThese are the people that they're chasing these are the people that there why are you saying this asking nuts\nAnd they were and by the way they were to Middle Eastern names correct\nAnd look we're not going to be\nI don't have any a desire to go out and be first I only have a desire and I believe responsibility to be accurate\nIf we're because we often report on breaking news we don't I Do I Do not want to be I don't want to put something out there I don't want to be a Brian Ross at ABC\nI don't because here's what's different about specific names if we if the the details do change on on breaking news stories we know that better than most people because we we covered we've covered some big stories over the years\nThe details do change but we're talking about like numbers or maybe okay it was over on this block or was in this town not this town what it is a specific name\nIf those names belong to people who are innocent Brian Ross\nOr anyone else that might be reporting something\nThen you start saying that because Brian Ross so they'd be see after the Aurora shooting well right\nThere's information that there is a man with that name that belongs to the Tea Party well how do you know it's the same one you just put that on ABC TV and he got burned and and he got\nBurned big time I Believe the goal and it is our goal to be accurate but the thing is is that there were people just they just kept pounding as for the last half of our show because we weren't putting the name out in fact you and I it wasn't until about thirty minutes after the show was done when authorities announced\nWho they were chased him and that we use the sunny and we set it on the air we set it on the air that look there's a couple of names out there we just can't verify many legit source that we believe that we have confidence in that it is a ... that is true and as you mentioned thirty minutes after our show\nIt wasn't the people right and so\nAgain we were called every name in the book we're you know you name it we were called it for hiding the truth from the people\nSee that's the implication hiding something from the people were not looking to hide anything we're just looking to be accurate\nAnd so when I look at this week that's what we've been focusing on is for the Republicans and the conservatives just focus on the truth\nThat so you can you can passionately attack the other side but don't play their game ... I've said it before they need to do it they don't have the substance of the issues they can't back up their points of view\nThey need it they ... out of desperation that they do it\nI don't feel desperate and whether whether whether the side\nThat I favor more wins an election or loses an election right I have never felt the need to use inflammatory rhetoric\nBecause I feel I have lost the substance of my argument\nTwo thousand two thousand eight denied of election night uh you know are they all the power goes to the Democrats and we've got calls why aren't you guys angry\nLook it didn't go my way I'm disappointed\nBut I had my say in it well we had been blunt uh I've\nA friend of mine yesterday posted wow you know the whole country's going much more conservative right now and I said look on social issues they aren't fiscal issues are not\nExplained it to him to death in the country is not going the way that I Want when it comes to debt Republicans don't care about the debt that we're putting on future generations fright they've completely\nThe only way that I Want when it comes to that Republicans don't care about the debt that we're putting on future generations right they've completely\nJust said let's not even pay attention to it right debt doesn't matter anymore\nWhat we put on future generations doesn't matter anymore we don't care we think that's wrong for the Republican Party right we think that's immoral or the Republican Party to not be wearing that as a badge of honor every single day\nWe understand that because they are following what the people are doing that yeah the rank and file of there and that's why we brought up that remember that the swap\nJust three years ago the swamp was about Republicans who wouldn't be fiscally responsible mhm that's gone yeah I'd like that that swamp doesn't even exist anymore of fiscal responsibility and the Republican Party that what drove\nReaching this milestone you can be a part of an elite club of drivers who share remarkable safety records and demonstrate superior driving skills\nIf you or someone you know it's a truck driver with a million miles or more driving with our preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com\nThat's run I radio show dot com\nThe red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\n... the ... family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fond of cats scale and ... products we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways sale you are they all left him with rich W.

I think that's something that we're likely will learn about and the and the coming days if you think about the um the forensics behind such an investigation there's plenty of of physical evidence to work with\nSo we'll we'll be looking at that and and\nIt's behind such an investigation there's plenty of of physical evidence to work with\nSo we'll we'll be looking at that and and as authorities are seem to be right now focusing on forward as a possible place where these packages or at least some of these packages were mailed from\nThen it's only a matter of time before they narrow that investigation down at at least have a description of not a full on identity of the person or persons responsible for mailing does\nI mean they they won't take it won't be long from there they're very good at what they do for video road love here here's your forecast\nFinally breaking the rains for Texas high pressure remains clear skies today over the state rain has moved to the east and we'll see it run today from I fifty five and I sixty five north and south\nAnd a good part of the mid west and south we'll see showers today most device Seventy five will look to see rain later in the day it will be clear in the northeast the desert southwest and dry in the nation's midsection\nAnd six out of the seven said absolutely not\nI Wonder what they would say if you said what if Chelsea Clinton came in and ran that would you run or campaign to write whatever right\nOkay so ... did did bill with Hillary completely taint any possibility shelter he ever having a political career which is why she would only agree to do it if she would be appointed if somebody stepped down a retired and she was appointed to that position\nImagine she ran in twenty twenty\nImagined that she just sweat and I mean it was just an\nOverwhelming [laughter] I got her mom standing on background going watch really my husband my daughter [laughter] but not me [laughter]\n[laughter] ah [laughter]\nIt's okay you get to be first mom [laughter]\n\n[laughter] oh yeah we'll we'll appoint you secretary of making pies yeah\nAh this this out yesterday Senate Judiciary committee chairman Chuck Grassley announced that he is referring Julie sweat Nick and her loyal lawyer excuse me Michael ... to the Justice Department for potential criminal investigation as to whether they made false statements to Congress about Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh and\n... said that in addition to making false statements he is asking the Justice Department to look into whether the Tucson to obstruct his panels investigation of the allegations of Kavanaugh\nQuote the law prohibits such false statements to Congress\nAnd obstruction of congressional committee investigations for the law to work we can't just brushed aside potential violations I don't take lightly making a referral of this nature but ignoring this behavior will just invite more of it in the future Grassley set in a statement and\nHaving any quickly fired back in a tweet saying it was ironic that Senator Grassley has now interested in investigations\nThat would be interesting to see where a case like that would go right\nYeah um you know you have a number of things there that honestly\nPet that that warrants an investigation I think [noise]\nHere's here's the question what if anything happens to it after the midterm assuming like the house takes control does it does an investigation like this go anywhere I guess\nBecause no reasonable prosecutor [laughter] what would pursue a a a\nA refer I I Would have to look at everything the Grassley has but he said he writes here in light of missed what makes him Mr ... own statements to the media\nInformation obtained from committee interviews of her associates and publicly reported information about her in Mr ... it has become a parent that the statements Mr ... submitted to the Kennedy likely contain material false claims Grassley wrote him a letter\nGrasses across does not guaranteed Justice Department will open a an investigation\nIs the last part of that\nAnd well he sent a letter to attorney general Jeff Sessions and FBI Director Christopher Wray right [noise]\nBecause if if the committee work to do I mean if they do an investigation then what would happen about if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a a referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good\nBut I happen to them if they found that there was wrongdoing you essentially send the Senate you send a a referral to the Justice Department at that point I mean good for\nProsecutorial means if you found that there was a wrong doing if you through the investigation your own investigation from I don't know everything that\nGrassley has yeah so I can so and I ... I can only speculate that if it's you know she claimed the gang rape mhm right right right\nAnd then but here's the thing\nYou the investigation doesn't go doesn't have to go too far because of the fact that she went on TV on a national television show on the today show and started to walk back some of the things in that sworn statement\nSo it's not like you it's not like the uh the the the house and their investigation into the Justice Department where you're looking to get you know it's like pulling teeth and getting some of the evidence or documents\nYou have things in a sworn statement that are countered in a nationally televised interview\nThat are different by the same person\nAnd the question is you know what do you do with that I mean does the political climate change if ah if the Democrats take the house or you know and does that kind of soften I guess the or or or steal from the the the desire\nTo pursue justice here oh that this will be the Senate so I Know I Know but it doesn't change anything about the sentiment because there has to be that while I Would like it and it goes back to that political will I think again no one is above the law\nAnd if you go through the process and this this really focuses on the the ... if the uh the tearing down and the shredding or the actual process itself by the Democrats especially Ron that committee during that process\nWe know that that was the you know the the hearings ... were about Dr Ford but this war was to add a this was adding to\nA an intended to influence the the outcome of the vote on Kavanaugh the confirmation vote on Kavanaugh it was part of that entire process while it was a separate from Dr Ford part of the camp a confirmation process so\nWhen you talk about doing the doing away or trying to do away or or completely dilute or shred the process\nIn the cell just then then I don't know why you wouldn't at least pursue an investment\nWhen we had the left come out and say look this isn't a trial this wasn't a trial we said well no it is a political trial and then there are things that are similar to a criminal trial which is your under oh mhm if you commit perjury mhm\nIn you know if it is and that's what he believes you know making false statements perjury if you don't that is against the law that you are breaking a criminal law at that point right as we said it's different than a criminal trial but as a political trial that has similarities you are put under oath\nAnd so the circus that we saw going on and I understand we're Grassley has going from if they if he believes and I don't know what evidence he has I don't know if anybody came forward\nAfter and I don't know who didn't testify or what information was not brought out than Grassley had that might you know that he might have now so I really don't know but if he believes that he can make that case\nFor making false statements base based on what she said based on the TV interview and based on\nWhat other people that might have come forward have come forward and a might have come forward since then have said to him absolutely he should go forward with that because\nIt is a it is a legal process or if somebody commits perjury or makes false statements they shouldn't be prosecuted we see what happens when we see what happens when somebody makes a false statement to an ... an FBI agent they go to jail Martha Stewart went to jail yeah\nSo should we say that when a political trial happens because that's what it was that none of the law should be followed at all that people should be able to go in and make a circus of it\nIf you can prove they know you know that they lied and their lawyer lied and their lawyer put them up to line should go after it I think\nThe majority of Americans if you ask them that generic question and kept the you know kept the case out of it the vast majority of Americans would say yes because\nIt is it was an attempt I think you can they would probably be able to prove through this investigation that the attempt the the the uh the the motive or what they were trying to do\nWas disrupt the process and if you do that through false means\nA boat and giving false testimony a sworn testimony to the Senate committee is against the law for reasons that that that's what that's about because that is a part of the process\nAnd if you if you can show that this was uh\nFor reasons that that that's what that's about because that is a part of the process\nAnd if you if you can show that this was the the the clear intent here\nWas to disrupt that process\nAnd you knowingly said things in that statement that sworn statement\nThat were false\nI don't know why you wouldn't move Fort well then what what did they take the house or not this is down the department of justice which is under the president so I don't see it stopping if they believe they actually have a castle ... because it does it this really isn't at this point isn't about\nPolitical will because frankly the left doesn't care about sweating no or ... you know\nSo you know my question on the on the house thing is that ... from the political will it's not about political will really\nEight six six Ninety red eye [noise]\nWith what I told ... ... ...

understand what she did you know for the campaign but really that charisma was carried by by Trump\nI so I I Know I so I don't know if of course I mean after you know after you're done as an advisor not really a lot of people care that's my whole point I don't know what\nAfter you know after you're done as an advisor not really a lot of people\nCare that's my whole point I don't know what the draw would be for for him\nTheir concern is as we've said before is once the government spending moderate\nThen that increased goes away and as we said before the true growth and if you listen to the show you know we've been consistent uh irrespective of whether it's been a Republican president or a Democratic president\nOr the GDP is not the most accurate way it's the way that we use and it's become the accepted way\nIt's never been the most uh uh accurate way we believe to truly a show the indication of economic growth\nBecause money being transferred back and forth or government spending is viewed the exact same way as private sector profits and sales and we believe that that distorts\nThe actual growth rate of any economy but it's been consistent from democratic presidents to a Republican presidents well it's important to monitor the truth expansion of wealth\nYes and that's and that is the that is the increase in goods and services produced by the private sector not that we don't support an increase in defense spending no we're ... we're just talking about how we analyze how it applies to the economy's doing so without the increased in government spending\nOr you would have had a a a ... a growth rate of of two point five six percent\nUp from the two point two percent from the Obama administration the point is how critical it is because you see the increase you see the increase in a huge increase why because of fossil fuels\nWhich drives the majority of the private sector increase in GDP that's still what's driving the majority increase in GDP in the private sector it's still not as much as government spending\nRight since April of of twenty Seventeen that's how much you know we have increased government spending over the last roughly year and a half\nWhen that government spending goes away so does the GDP increase that's why we have been so concerned and we've taken a great deal of criticism\nFrom people who used to agree with us\nBut now disagree with us on the increase of increasing the cost of goods by terrorists and as we've stayed it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter whether you call yourself a Republican or conservative or liberal a socialist a capitalist if you believe\nThat an increased cost him goods in the marketplace benefits the economy then you don't know what you're talking about it's that simple\nAnd so that's why we have always been so concerned about trade and about artificially increasing the cost of goods and services\nWhen we've talked about the president and the new NAFTA the president's number one accomplishment on the new NAFTA has been what\nWhat he believes he has done to the car industry\nWhich will increase the cost of buying a car in the United states in Canada in Mexico and we'll make it harder to sell that product made in the United states overseas which was what the president claimed\nHe wanted on trade and we will continue to say this on tariffs the president is all over the place\nAnd when you're all over the place on a particular issue one has to ask do you have any idea what you're talking about well\nAnd as we uh break down the GDP Growth and you look at it right now and the way that there's this long lead and they point this out on this Wall Street journal article for items like aircraft carriers and things like this so we're likely to see as this money goes through the ... a Pentagon and then there's actually spent and\nAnd and and through the contractors were likely to see some of this growth continue in terms of the defense spending growth\nA leading the way into twenty ... twenty Nineteen and twenty twenty\nSo what's important here is that you kind of separate that from what the private sector is doing we're the gross is in the private sector\nOr where the lack of growth is\nIn the ... in the end of that you do yes you you do have to separate the two because government spending even for\nA quick and even though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's ... it's not why you do it but also that is the majority of that money\nEven though there is a benefit for those companies doing it that's not why you do it right it's not what it is that why you do it and but also that is the majority of that money mhm of increase in that money is coming from borrowed money is coming from money that the
