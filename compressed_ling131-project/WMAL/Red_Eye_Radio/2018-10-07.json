you um I I was watching the Christian work this afternoon and what other correspondents was talking about\nNext Ford or\nTo the FBI to have her therapy notes from two thousand and twelve and no no no\nNo she didn't know she did she tell you what she did and I mean not all of that is what she did not want back she was holding back the\nNotes from that there is from the FBI\nNo no she was holding them back to the Senate not from\nThe from the Senate yes at the same thing there's no difference\nNo no there's a big difference other as\nIt is it's part of the FBI it's a separate branch what are you talking about\nWhat no you can give it to the Democrats then you give it to the Democrats and then they and they present it and the people get to see the FBI or what you forget about is the FBI is not investigating anything on the ground with um I wasn't a criminal matter it was a background check they in fact\nWhat the FBI would deal with it would be put it into the three oh two white which then the Democrats and the Republicans would both have that's how that works right that's the only role of the FBI in this entire equation is to give the Senate the information\nYou're making the FBI but then do an investigation on it no it would end up in the partisan body anyway\nThat's in fact the only purpose the FBI serves in this scenario is to deliver that information to the White House in the Senate\nIf I mean she would officially be dip putting it into the three oh two had she'd done that during the process and the way I agreed to take out the way they they tried to put it in the process would chairman Grassley twice says call for it\nAnd uh it's a Feinstein of Feinstein would have gone right to the FBI at that point they could have done it that way she could have given it to them so they didn't do go that way no so it's a useless conversation\nAnd and anyone and if if that would if forward if that's accurate the report that they tried to do that\nA and forge assuming force lawyers were telling the truth again they're trying to circumvent the system so the information will get out but won't be in the three oh two after because of the background check the

clear today with the exception of far western Texas there is a moderate to risk of excessive rainfall however from eastern Iowa into far northwestern Illinois and south western Wisconsin\nBut you have repeatedly refused to produce this evidence to the Senate in doing so you are preventing the Senate from considering the evidence most crucial to Dr Ford's allegation I\nDon't know what other imprint we should draw from your refusal but that the withheld evidence does not support Dr Ford's allegation and quite the way you will have claimed ooh that's a challenge is not\nRight I urge you once again now for the third time in writing\nTo turn over the therapy notes polygraph materials and communications with the ah with the Washington Post that Dr Ford has relied upon as evidence in addition to the evidence I requested in my Tobar second letter in light of recently uncovered information this is interesting because that was the key of\nLook at the uh the last sentence with recently uncovered information please turn over records and descriptions of direct or indirect contact with senators or their staffs particularly the offices of senators Feinstein and Hirono\nOther than a your communications with me and my staff member my step in preparation for the September twenty seventh hearing the alleged witnesses identified by Dr Ford leaving them Kaiser mark judge and Patrick Smith and\nA deadly re mirrors Julie sweat neck or their representatives sincerely Chuck Grassley that letter said yesterday [noise]\nSo it was like I said in the last caller brought up was she was willing to turn them over to the FBI\nAnd our and our point was ... when I'm when I said no it's like because our point is to go directly to the Senate to begin with ... there is no investigation they wouldn't be in bed they simply take it and give it to the Senate Judiciary committee\nKind of ended up in the report we wouldn't see that the the only senators was set\nThe only the centers would see it and there for a goal is if she has this slam dunk evidence and she wants to the people who said she wants to people to see it so then the people can decide give it to a Grassley\nDirectly outside of the three oh two because then the other members of the committee including Dianne Feinstein\nDianne Feinstein would get it and immediately leak\nExactly\nOr\nJoint and legally for [laughter] just released the entire ride to the to the Washington Post and let them printed completely sure\n'cause\nThey're not political [laughter]\nOkay that's a really hard time well the Washington Post and the wall street\nJournal no I'd be from you know from the west point of view and and that was the the point well no the senators or political the FBI is not only was the Washington Post according to the liberals\nAre and that ... let me see that ah when was that sent here in front of you were okay 'cause that letter must have been late last night to Shannon Bream a pulse uh ten forty seven PM and then I'd seen the I'm a Mollie Hemingway the last paragraph sure as interesting\nAmong please let us know your please give to us you know what you've shared with Feinstein in her own oh\nWhoa mhm\nBecause of uncovered evidence so what do they have\nRight what what is what is that what does that one about so again I'm we're getting into stupid area again we're getting into areas you know with the lawyers state and they're going to do something that doesn't even make any sense\nYeah yeah and I ate a demand that doesn't even a demand that would in a demand that would ensure if you went through it that way that the nodes would never become public right you would never know what was in the ... they would not\nBecause of the Senate rule see the light of day\nIf you want this public there's plenty of ways to do that\n[noise] ah eight six six Ninety right on let's go to Sherman in Indonesia Sherman welcome you're on Radio Welcome to the show listening online high\nThanks good afternoon from Indonesia I'm a long time listener first time caller you know I don't care whether you're a Democrat or Republican as you pointed out it is just sheer committees job to investigate cabin or and this whole situation\nAnd Dianne Feinstein struck the justice I don't know why everybody's not totally up in arms about this maybe eventually they will be\nBut to me that the ... we are criminal and all of this because it fine dining relieve release it super makes it back in July it would've been quietly handled and investigated thoroughly it would have made paying\nThe anonymity of blogs they forward it would have respected Kavanaugh's reputation and they would have gotten to the bottom but they can either cabin uh would affect ... start to bomb a nation or and ... for it would have been proved to be right\nOr not but I N Feinstein obstructed justice here and pull this last minute and she should be you know we're at a town on a rail for obstructing justice I mean it's a criminal act\nWell if you look at it as whom who betrayed the trust\nOf of Dr Ford\nAnd find it was ... it was that was the Democrats right now I'm looking on the they're the ones that leads into the media if if if we're taking Dr forward at her word mhm then the only people that have been trained doctor Ford or the Democrats right\n[noise] exactly and that the biggest thing\nThat's being missed and it it\nWas comedy of the end of the main street over and over getting more and more rural and I just don't understand why every American would it be up in arms over and find science I really don't

I'm sure they're going to make this work while your daughters and it wedding is certainly paramount uh I'm certain there was there was no way the Danes was going to miss that\nAre either of those\nEvents the vote\nUm the up outside of the the cartels that are operating in with all due respect to the cartels [laughter] um the the whole idea though is that you've got to broaden it beyond the El Paso district right I mean he can win the Paso district as long as he wants to\nRun for that house seat um and I have friends there that say oh man he's got his hands and everything you you know so um yeah uh\nThat's different though when you broadened it out to the rest of Texas now certainly he's done better than um a lot of the people who jumped into different racist\nOr the former ah Dallas County sheriff Lupe Lupe Valdez uh and uh you know her running against ah the the current Governor Greg Abbott um that's you know again\nHe's he's very well in the lead but well when you broaden it out to the state right level you've got to go wild you got to realize that you you have to pretend you're in the middle\nWell then and that's a bit of work he's trying to do is try and do you try to picture himself and he's not in the middle on anything no but he he realizes that he has to lie even to get demos he can't be truthful even with Democrats in Texas\nAnd hope to get elected and yet the realization I mean the Democrats used to be that way all the time they used to\nWe need to move to the middle we need to move to the middle we gotta move to the middle we've got to move to the middle\nAnd and then over the last ten years or so no they were reading basically this is who we are I guess my point is\nThat when you think about ten years ago right now when you think of ten years ago mhm\nWhen Obama was running for president ... wasn't it right about now right around this was in October remember he held it would've been no what about the convention\nWhere your conviction ... when he was at the stadium the football stadium in in in Denver and they had like ... it looked like\nHe was a you know the the the entire stage it was set up with these ... and everything else where he looked like some Greek forum yes yes mhm and ... and people going crazy and and remembering his first term Evan Thomas from\nNewsweek at the time he's God blight yeah he's he's a ... you'd always post partisan he's God like he hovers over the rest of us he's the smartest person in the world to now ten years later\nOne of the leading\nSocialist candidates in the country mhm I\nRide on Obama's yeah we don't I don't need all that we don't we don't need a bomb gas\nSo they don't as a Hollywood about that's that's a great point because here's the thing is that a ... in inside the state it doesn't work but\nA work has no problem taking money from outside the said from the liberals who have been pouring money into the state of well into his coffers in order to be Ted Cruz and an effort to be Ted Cruz um you know so you know he wants the liberal basically fill liberals to are you guys stay outside of Texas\nLook we've got our liberal places in in Texas but there are plenty of the districts that are blue and counties that are blue including the county we [noise]\nIncluding the county we broadcast from yeah but but here\nThe the point is though the point is not who he would have gotten in addition if he would have got ... Obama ... but the fact is he knew he could reject Obama publicly yet\nBut then the ... I didn't ask core yeah doesn't care yeah Obama means nothing no no no no that's that's exactly what I'm what I'm getting too is that it does nothing for them and it only irritates someone who might be in the middle and ...\nI mean it's it only works against that middle which might get you over it actually is the only thing that in this case especially that's going to get you over the top for the win but he knows by essentially denouncing and saying you know turning down the Obama endorsement\nThat it does not hurt his base\nRight they don't care right we do a whole because Obama yesterday's news well listen I mean\nI'm a lawyer Lanny Davis remember he was going to be the hero you know so he was a hero with them over the point is is not that Lanny Davis is is a rock Obama but the point is is that there is a new hero for different reasons every day on the left and by the way that the euro is going to be the demon tomorrow\nThat's the way it works because you could be someone who is a federal victim of whatever right now but tomorrow you're going to be the oppressor\nThere's the person standing next to you will have a new reason to white victim and will need a new oppressor and it's going to be you here's here's\nBut my my again I could be wrong but here's my here's my God that liberal Democrats the ones that would vote for you know a beta or care in the state of Texas so I look at I Can't believe we're gonna use the word they look at Obama and say he was a poster\nHe really said he was going to do all this stuff and he didn't do a damn thing right he just sat up there any like being president but he really didn't believe and didn't push the leftist causes that we believed in that he went from God to light to pose or in ten years\nWent by the beginning of his his inauguration till the end\nOf his term as president of the United states that is how the modern day liberal looks at him they look at him and they just say\nWow okay also eat him anymore he's not to think about this now is the Obama is not pick a president like Kim cause you and I talked about this and that you know by the by the time we got to the terms that Obama would be the leader we ... item so predicted it but I thought there was a great chance that Obama\nBecause there was nobody else in Feinstein you know or or or Pelosi's getting old and you know Schumer is to New York and so when still be Obama that would be the leader for a while of the Democrat Party is nothing anymore\nNow going back to the ... the tragic night here in Dallas in July or twenty sixteen when five police officers were killed by Michael Johnson\nAnd the hours that led up to that horrific night it was just a few a couple of hours before it started I was online uh I follow the local media on Facebook and one of the local TV stations was live Facebooking\nThe protestors because it was a protest march and was peaceful up until that point of course [noise]\nBut they were talking to the leaders of the protest associated with a there were a couple of different groups that were represented there are including black lives matter but the leaders of the protest the ones who are speaking\nThis was about six forty five PM in the ... that was the reason that the television station was life Facebooking this because they're broadcast the six PM broadcast news broadcast was over so they went to like Facebook so I'm watching\nThe thing I remember the most is them saying what does Obama done for us to remember this was began or yeah twenty six ten months before the twenty sixteen election July twenty sixteen waters Hillary done for us nothing what did Obama do for us\nNothing and I thought to myself you know there because that was one of those\nAh cracks in the foundation if you will of the left although it had started happening before that for me\nIt was telling because you had young activists\nAnd the two that were speaking were African American why does Obama done for us was Hillary done for us the left or the Democrats the Democratic party thinking they're going to get the win\nAnd to get the when you don't get the win just because they may agree with you at the moment\nThe protestors are carrying the party the party doesn't have direction because there's no one single cause no it's no rational right and it it it always will be that's why the party\nHas no direct I invited out that's what you get with identity politics yeah because there is no there are still there and I edited there is there is no general issue or goal ... goals that they actually want because when you split everybody gets when you when you continue to expand your pie of victims and therefore expand your pie of oppressors\nYou end up never being able to as a party happy in a particular political goals this is probably the closest to you'll get to a political goal which is to defeat Kavanaugh\nYes if the activists are are are going in multiple directions well then then the party has led by them they're going to try and there was every direction and they have no direction at all except for abortion\nWrapping right now you're nights the Democrats right eight six six Ninety road

that uh I'm I'm certain that was back then but you can easily apply that to what's going on today that if a claim 'cause the FBI is not doing a criminal investigation\nI hate the fact that we have to keep saying it but I feel it's necessary so if you talk about how a background check has done for those that were in the military that had certain clearance\nA you know all too well or going into the

tie in we were ... there's no reason\nIf you're investigating Donald Trump to be talking to the ... lawyers private lawyers\nJust before you got the secured worn right Internet your investigation going on and he apparently that's what the sources say he said they talked to they talked to ... the lawyer specifically about the allegations of Trump and collusion why\nWhy would that be why would that be so that she was breaking news\nBreaking news other news and we'll talk more about that I'm sure in the upcoming days or the news want to get in Saudi Arabia has increased crude production significantly to a near record level amid intense pressure from US President Donald Trump to reduce prices there's some Bloomberg now\n... largest producer is currently pumping about ten point seven million barrels a day the energy minister told reporters on Wednesday that's just shy of the record set\nIn November of twenty sixteen before the kingdom and allies including Russia agreed to cut production to boost prices were meeting every single demand for barrels he said we've increased production quite significantly we just have to be responsive to demand because some would say that the market is currently over supplied he said\nAre the key insights this is from Bloomberg their analysis Saudi Arabia appears to be borrowing again to pressure from\nTrump that we've talked about this 'cause we got we we got a couple of messages when we said that the United states now we're not we now are the leading producer of oil in the war yep we beat sorted we'd be that every other country and somebody called up and they said well banal ... prices aren't really really low\nBecause there are other factors involved and there's been a ... a there's a sanctions against a a a a you know Iran there has been a growing economy so prices haven't gone to record lows we didn't expect them to go to record lows the whole point is\nThat when you produce your own oil here and we become a record producer of oil that's money that stays here well and\nAnd you look at the again the mass of wealth expansion that we're seeing you had the fed chairman making the comments that the economy the future right now looks very very bright and in fact almost unbelievably good\nAt some levels well that comes from an expansion of you look at the number one I'm On the GDP and you look at the growth and everything else what's always the the number one category leading its mining which includes drilling and that oil export exploration and energy exploration and and and production\nIs key you don't have to have a you don't have to be working in the oil fields to benefit from that and that's the whole point\nWe've been saying this for years that once we realized that the regulations only the regulations were holding us back\nThat we would start seeing a wealth expansion and I'm convinced that is exactly what will start seeing more and more than I\nGet I give credit here to President Trump where he communicated the message to Saudi Arabia ... excuse me\nWe're there for you right we're there for you all you know are we why are we finding what you were military were were there for you all the time ... ah and\nWhoever thought that the United states would be the leading producer of oil and couldn't convince and OPEC member Saudi Arabia OPEC member bill pact member [laughter] very good deal back that video that member right Saudi Arabia to produce more oil if you don't think look we've criticized Trump in in in in ways\nBut we talked about when he does extremely good things we've talked about the fact that no other\nThere was no other Democrat courses nor the Democrats there is no other Republican that could have gotten the cut in taxes that he got especially the Twenty one percent corporate tax ... no one he deserves full credit for that and he deserves full credit\nFor that right there now one other point I just wanted to make real quickly because we talked about the new NAFTA agreement and um whatever wild starts to be called NAFTA you know the new trade agreement and we had said look and we said this a long time ago we said one of the reasons that we are concerned [laughter] and we're ... babies\nAre one of the original terribly terribly [laughter] you know one one of the reasons that we were concerned who said look\nEventually when this agreement comes out it's not really going to be different\nThan the agreement that that we have now ...\nOr ... who is leading economists for the wall Street Journal the exact same thing in the end the new U.S Mexico Canada agreement looks like\nA lot like the old NAFTA\nOnly significant concession was on automobiles in parts rules requiring more production in North America highway higher wages for workers and potential terrorists if its exports to the U. S. exceed two point six million vehicles that even though there's a cat because her way below that now\nA yet these auto rules may have little practical significance\nThey talked to judge Schuster of a a A L L M C automotive said some lower priced models now assembled by Volkswagen Mazda in a few other manufacturers in Mexico\nMay no longer qualify for duty free entry but they're not going to shift to the U.S production they may simply pay the the two point five percent tariff nibble hurt us consumers especially low income consumers in the United states\nAnd so we have said and they've said the cap on exports may discourage manufacturers from sending expanding capacity in Mexico but it won't affect current shipments a they basically said it's exactly the kind of thing that we did with\nSouth Korea ... that we set these limits but we're not even reaching the limits were not close to them now and that costs limits now so it really doesn't make a difference but he said\nMake a difference but he said really there's not much difference in the old NAFTA as there is the new NAFTA and you build a name has been changed by it and it's subtle along are we there's been a lot of
