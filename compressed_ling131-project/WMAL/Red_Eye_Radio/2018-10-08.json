calling the judges conservative judges mhm\nYou and I've gone through this before we talk about how we even have got caught saying it just because you know it it's a ... but they're not conservative judges there's a complete and total difference between what conservatives wanted a Supreme Court justice and what liberals want\nMhm uh we want to Supreme Court justice that has an originalist or a ... you know ... or construction is somebody will look at the text of the of of the constitution whatever it is and say it says this and I'm not going to read into it\nIrrespective of whether it hurts my day to day politics a Supreme Court justice putting them into office was not about my day to day politics it's about upholding the constitution of the United states it is about the legislate short making laws\nAnd not an unelected the judge\nTo the left it is about an unelected judge\nMaking law making legislation mhm we go back to\nIn order to get the judge in that will fulfill their liberal desires and a judge that will legislate for them\nThey're all over the place on their opinions as\nTheir opinions don't and their opinions on their goal post move all over the place right so to me it was the fact that you were able to see the left and them and not just the far left what you saw because we\nNormally get calls where people will say well that's not the mainstream of the Democratic party\nWhat you saw over the last two weeks was the mainstream of the Democratic party in Washington DC the leadership of the Democratic party that reject due process under the law reject a presumption of innocence\nAnd we'll slander and fame somebody's character without evidence to do so yeah\nAnd I think a lot of I'll tell you I had a conversation with independent Bob yesterday boy he

Obama campaign is actually [laughter] so it doesn't matter who you are you're not immune for ... here's your forecast\nWill see the bulk of showers today extend from northern Texas along I thirty five in through Oklahoma Kansas and portions of Iowa into I'm Ninety four country where some of that rain could turn over to snow\nAs you get near the Canadian border primarily dry in the northeast the mid Atlantic and much of the south today Gulf Coast states have a chance of rain California will be dry we've got spotty showers\nThey're going to whine about it a little more on Sunday Morning and then as we predicted or as we told you it's really not a production because they are too predictable on the left\nThe protestors go home and it's over you know you you still have some talking members of the house talking about in ... not going to happen\nIt's not going to happen because you're not going to move on it when when you know you want to do well if you want to open this door if you want to go down that road\nGo for it I'm sure you'll have some radicals on the left on Capitol Hill that will keep talking about it but it's not going to happen for a reason because there's nothing there it's the reason the confirmation vote went through and he was ultimately confirmed\nYou're not going to have them well we can move and we can do this it those stories are given the same credibility that the Van Jones story was given when when when Van Jones is rolling up his sleeves and working in a grassroots effort to change their mind they elect tours no\nThat didn't happen in fact\nHillary had a net loss\nLife doors and Trump had a net gain after the election after the election\nBecause these people don't live in reality they don't look at the facts and anything they don't they don't care about the process they want you to believe that that the process is that they slap on the Superman tape and they're going to be a hero in a moment\nAnd it doesn't happen that way you had a situation in the cabinet confirmation process that was wild it was distorted if you look at it the President Trump was the one that really made that happened in terms of extending it out\nSo there was a supplemental background check\nThere was zero zero credit of course and he wasn't looking to get credit but the people he wasn't loading the ticket\nHe wasn't looking to get credit from the the media or the left of course\nBut the people the everyday people look at it and\nThey'll they'll look back on this process and go well one of the you know what is it that the the ones I I mean they don't follow it every day and we know people work and some people work around the clock and thank you for listening and you don't take it in like like we do or or or your average new sound would do\nSo you don't have all the details but they look back on this and they look at the facts of this by doing just simple research and they see that it was the president himself\nThat allowed to process it was Chuck Grassley that allowed her to testify it was the Republicans that gave her every single chance to prove her case\nAnd she could not that's the reality of this all\nNot that the you know the left wants you to believe in the protesters in the ... and the baby's\nWant you to believe that it was the Republicans who squashed it no they opened it why you could not have given them or her\nMore of an opportunity to come in and prove her allegations not not to the fact that she has to prove them like a court of law but just something just to stand children of\nA preponderance of the of of right of the the evidence something\nTo back it up and she couldn't do it now\nAnd neither could neither could re mirrors and and if you look at what was actually done there are there what what didn't what can we find out the only thing that we didn't find out\nWas Ford who said that her\nThe the uh the notes and whether she had video whatever the polygraph doesn't and the therapists nodes would cooperate what she said and she refused to turn them over right it's really the only thing that we don't know because she refused and her lawyers refused to to turn them over everything that we now\nI mean there there is and if you can point to get to the the as the FBI said we only we know that ... you know we know that are not ... but when the ... uh came out and said that uh you know that her lawyers oh you're twenty people we want a ... interview well that's not the point\nThe point is they asked her directly who were the people that you say are witnesses to the actual event but she pointed out the witnesses they interviewed them none of them right could cooperate and say\nAnything happened in that case and none of them said anything she had plenty of time to talk she could have gone back to the Judiciary Committee or Dr Ford could and she never did\nAnd with those no she could've answered them over a nearly well it was two weeks ago when the when the Judiciary Committee and the chairman as fast for them right because the the story came out\nThat she and her lawyer prove or lawyers were offering those therapists notes to the FBI\nThat's interesting that we learned that after we learned that they weren't going to interview her and the supplemental background check that really is convenient\nOh no we're we're willing we call them we were going to give them you know you weren't you knew there and they weren't you have to come to you had\nPlenty of opportunity or are they would have simply taking them and given to the Senate Judiciary committee how were they were not going to make a judgment on it they would give it to the Senate Judiciary committee ... and the Senate Judiciary committee would have gone over would have gone over that right there isn't anything of substance that the left has on the no\nThe only thing the left has is again and it was ever changing you always believe women well unless it's a conservative woman\nOr a you know you'll ... you'll never believe the you never believe the uh the the man you had white males and the Senate Judiciary committee but when it came to the substance of the actual case\nYou know of of the political trucks that is what it was it was a political trial people say it was just a job interview uh yeah you uh don't involve the FBI in a normal job interview and uh you don't put people under oath\nUnder penalty of perjury for the average job interviews I Do if you're saying it was just like an average job interview or you're a little bit of a you're a little bit mistaken it got down to the point where all they had was an allegation and they believe than an allegation should be enough\nMhm rarely if we were first roles would that be enough ...\nReally is that where you are now the allegation is enough\nAnd then you've got to the point with Cory Booker well uh it doesn't matter the the whether he's guilty or innocent doesn't matter it's just there's so many allegations right that he should step down because yes yes well then you get what you want to have multiple unbearable ride for allegations and that's enough for somebody to step down nothing that\nThe left are brought up nothing that the mainstream Democrats brought up we need to make sure the right to clarify this because we always get those road that's not just in this was the mainstream of the Democratic party right and that's what they were trying to get you to buy they were trying to get you to buy that\nThat the allegation is enough\nThat up a woman says it in this case it must be bullied not another cases but just this particular case it must be bullied now I Know that they generally said all women must be believed but then the women that said well why aren't you believe you not say just conveniently ignored right\nAnd and so that's what we're being told that the preponderance of the the the presumption of innocence uh ... you know doesn't exist uh for for a man or defending yourself in a passionate way shows guilt mhm\nUh everything that they sure why does not pass the rational thought or critical thinking test mhm\nNone of it and it was from again I we need to repeat this this is not the fringe Democrats this is the main stream of the Democrat Party it is the Senate\nIt is the Senate Judiciary committee it is the leadership of the Democratic party and\nThey're trying to get you just to throw away any mindset of due process site\nWell as we saw even independence when the pollen came out last week you know didn't buy it when they found out oh we didn't know that all her witnesses said they couldn't cooperate at well the no\nConfirm yeah and and that's that's it I mean if you look at the end while it was a a fifty to forty eight vote if you look at the process from start to finish every opportunity was given to the accusers\nUh the the process was even distorted to that extent so to in order to facilitate that and then ultimately it came down to ... while I was voted along party lines\nWith with what two exceptions really and then other than that that's what it's always going to be and it doesn't matter that it's Trump as president it doesn't matter that it's kept when I was the nominee is where we are as a nation politically right\nNow if Trump wasn't president if it was somebody else yup and he was Kavanaugh was up there yet it would've been the exact same ... same right than a

wouldn't matter who was elected president of the Republican side there would have done this to anyone would have been ... whoever you only get plane chairs the lake come by\nSo Trump fights back is like a lion\nAnd and and and he just makes me very proud to be alert and they're actually very proud to say that I voted bad\nI uh I Would say this Bryan that I I'm not sure and we will we will never know but I'm not sure how another Republican would have reacted to the heat on Kavanaugh if they might have withdrawn his\nNomination and I think that's something to consider is that is it that Trump or wouldn't back down and and he refused to withdraw that nomination that's a possibility I don't know how to quantify that because we'll never know but it's I think we have to consider that possibility\nWell thank you for taking my call ... ... uh you take your and but he brings up a point that we have made all along we made it last week made of the week before ... ... you know well this is what you get when you get Trump now this would\nHave happened no matter what is this the the the craziness surrounding it and and the left behavior definitely would have happened I'm In the past Republicans other Republicans might have been\nApparently not Lindsey Graham but [laughter] other Republicans might have because we talked about how the Republicans in the past\nHave been quick to eat their own I don't I don't know I Can't say that about a is it because we don't we'll never know if Ted Cruz that one or as he mentioned a Rubio or anybody else and other Republicans were there or Mike Pence I have no idea\nUh we don't know if if they would have withdrawn the nomination\nUm when the press this president basically said okay fine we'll do another FBI background check 'em you know big giving it the tire a vetting process of seven complete background checks\n[noise] so I don't know I but I Do know that this president has been less willing to back down\nIt is the reason that you from the beginning so you know ultimately with your vote that it becomes well as it always is that buying their decision and then along the way regardless of whether or not and I saw somebody in my neighborhood with for Ted Cruz signs in their yard\nI thought you know not one not too but a total of four they're really\nReally voting for Ted Cruz and so our time and time I'm ... and and I thought I thought to myself you know okay that's that's a that kind of enthusiasm\nUm even if we were to show that uh we don't do and we don't do endorsements because again as we mentioned earlier I don't believe they really do anything it tells it it might tell your audience which way you're going but there are the the point is is that we have the discussion\nOn the ideas and we believe that our audience than the rest of the country is smart enough to make their own decisions they may be willfully ignorant not our listeners but\nOthers may be willfully ignorant along the way they can make their decision or you know a ... they're they're still capable of finding the information whether they choose to or not but ultimately it is about\nAh when that person is elected if I\nIf I'm campaigning for them if I'm doing a volunteer work for them if I donate to their campaign I'm Still from day one going to watch them on on the issues on their work you judge them on the work and then of course a head of that work\nYou a back them in order to you know uh to to\nHave them do that work to keep them in place to do that work and you see a George W. Bush or anybody else that came together and most dead on the right or for judge Kavanaugh's confirmation and it really was about what the work and\nAnd and the results of the work of this president by nominating Kavanaugh but also the Senate or more importantly and more recently uh the work there\nAnd why it's important for Republicans in this case right now to be banded together a because it used to be where we could have the discussion will still have them I'm sure of the you know the far right conservatives on Capitol Hill versus the moderates\nUm but the end and one of those moderates along the way would include Lindsey Graham\nWas just going to I was just going to um mentioned that that we knew that three weeks ago that the less was motivated because they hate Trump right uh I don't know how much more motivated they could get I don't know this whole debate the more or whether there'll be a\nA whether there'll be more of a sign of of despair and hopelessness we know the young people and I haven't seen a change in the young people that vote Democrat are\nAre not enthusiastic about voting in this mid term ... and that could hurt the Democrats\nBut what I Know now know is that the Republican Party you mentioned Lindsey Graham you look at look at Lindsey Graham and the fight to defend Trump and his pick yeah because if you're defending his ... year defending Trump right there is a unity there if you see that George W. Bush or read that called Collins numerous times\nUh didn't tell her how to a vote when you see the colon speech\nYeah and and except for here it's really a ... ...\nIt was I disagreed with her honors of each other like when she gave a Dianne Feinstein the past ... the big pass which he shouldn't have done because Dianne Feinstein was the reason that we got to this point to begin with and to say that I Know that she would never leak anything like that is forgetting about everything else that she did wrong and\nAh but the fact is Collins speech was very very thorough walk through every single a point and came across as very very common sense and this is Susan Collins defending the great Trump pick\nOf Brett Kavanaugh\nUm you know you can only fight so much within your own party before you realize it's working against you and the things that you wish to\nUh uh get done as a Republican the Republican Party right now it's a pretty big party it's a pretty big party going from conservatives to moderate liberal really is just met him when he comes when it comes to spending culturally uh probably a more right than they've been in a while\nA more constitutional is than they've been in a while when it comes to social issues not spending issues right there as bad as Democrats have been in the past ah ah ah right now and you know but and and that's a shame but overall when you look at it\nYou have unity in that party\nAs I said last week like I Can't remember when we had such unity part of it is the fight or from the president but the president has always had that fight in rhetoric\nBut in some sense you know when some of the people that he picked and how he would change his opinions or a ... on them and not stick with them and you know even you know going after sections as he still goes after them as he did others early on\nMajor thing okay doesn't really know who is picking doesn't really have confidence in the people out there and him sticking by Kavanaugh\nWasn't just rhetoric it was the substance of no he stays and we're going with him and I don't know whether that embolden other people to say what they what they said I don't know you know ... what was the spark that drove Lindsey Graham\nTo still be on the Sunday Morning news show same he'll GO Campaign anywhere in any purple state yeah right\n... you know and that's it because that's where the effort has to be we can still have the discussions within a the right on\nIssues of where we need to go especially putting pressure on them to control spending to change fiscal policy\nOr to the extent that it is going to be meaningful and mean great things long term for this country I I think we are light years right now or to say that this kind of momentum can get us to that point where we can change the spending habits I mean for Republicans and\nTheir mentality on that is is not there yet we're we're probably away from that because that goes back to again what we said the base uh the the rank and file Republicans and and what they want out of their government but again that's a discussion we can have\nUltimately what has to happen though and this is this is you see this to some extent on the lap while in social media and then the protests calling out or or even officially the calling out of a Dianne Feinstein I mean before this process the uh Democrats of California you know not backing her officially\nA for her run and that kind of again ... that's ... that's an anomaly\nOften on the left they are better than the right\nAt letting the uh mansions of the world\nAnd even maybe a high camp uh uh do what they do in their state\nBecause it gives them the seat ultimately on other end the vote on other issues I'm On the right there has to be I I guess a greater unity politically on Capitol Hill of\nBuilding building the wall really if you if you think about it that guards guards this nation\nAgainst the kind of behavior we saw over the last few weeks this is not this kind of behavior is not over they believe they almost got there they believe they did change the process they do believe they can change the process and other items if they get a head start which is why they start with well we need to do away with the Senate\nAnd we predicted this the moment they talked about getting away with a good well in the way with the ... the Democratic senators won't be for that no that's it's not going to have you know it's nothing but the point being is their behavior is not going to change and they'll work to that end and\nIt means if the because of they're willing to you know to talk about and and maybe even get some kind of moving growing movement and the calling for doing away with the Senate which again will never happen\nThey are willing to do and and work in any in every direction to do away with this and that and those little things and\nWell things and that guard has to be built that power that castle if you will that wall that mode has to be built around this nation to protect this constitution\nYou can get a few things done if you're not unified but I Believe you get a lot more things done when you're unified especially when you're unified over the substance of of an issue in the substance is here\nI'm a very easy presumption of innocence ... due process constitutional issues not defending somebody when you talk about those are all ... moral issues\nAnd that's what has United the Republican Party I Hope it continues to unite them through the election and if they are able to take the house it'll be interesting to see if they can take that unity into two thousand Nineteen in two thousand twenty\nAnd get legislation passed that is extremely productive and conservative\nAnd hopefully give Trump a chance to win and twenty twenty again state yeah\n... or a book or right by the way I remember after the Roy Moore last that's when they got the tax deal done that's when they got that legislation done they\nCouldn't get it done before they lost that seat when they lost that seat that was motivating it shouldn't have been they should have been ... motivated before that\nEight six six Ninety read I\nWas feeling back

Morning talk shows yesterday some we'll hear from him on a on that the interesting thing is you heard of a representative Jerrold Nadler say that if\nUh the Democrats took the house in November that they would start impeachment proceedings right a on a Brett Kavanaugh that would mean you'd have to bring all the witness was back again and everything else that would be interesting from what it says especially Dr Ford who said she doesn't want to continue this any longer\nAh and ah you know it does ah I really wonder whether that's just an idle threat or what the Democrats really want much more transparency on the stories of these different\nUh women who met allegations are against\nA a Brett Brett Kavanaugh but as we know the process or even if you did get the impeachment which would be getting a the majority of Congress you would still in order to remove him have to go through the Senate and there's no way you're going to get sixty six votes in the Senate to get rid of him so he's on the Supreme Court\nAnd he's on the Supreme Court to stay and there's nothing the Democrats can do to do it do it there's nothing the Democrats can do to stop it and if they try to do what they do it at their own peril if they end up taking the the house\nYeah it's only really uh they're they're going to use it as a motivator to get people out to try and give people a motivated to get to the polls in November beyond November it's not going anywhere whether they win the house or not ah my I guess my question would be is it a motivator to get Republicans out\nOr is this ... because we can we we've seen it I've probably in the past I Can't think offhand up\nOf of an instance but you know where it was something will come along and once it happens it's like okay we got this and then it seems as if the excitement level to go out and vote is dead I don't sense it here at all I sense there is a a anger here in a unity\nRemember you had a significant portion of the Republican Party that was split\nAnd and I don't\nBelieve this is just about capital I think it is about the fact that\nYou have the as I've said why'd I think it will Washington Examiner said or a quarter of Republicans or identify themselves as socialist a quarter an avid democratic but a quarter of Republicans and I thought to myself you know that shows you how wide the Republican Party is\nUh uh right now and this and the anger and the unity comes from the fact that\nThey listen to a Democratic Party and the mainstream of the Democratic party who when you listen to if you're not talking about the fringe anymore you're talking about the mainstream leadership those in the Senate Judiciary committee\nBetter talking insane ... they're talking about things that are completely against fairness and constitutional

Frank Bruni writes\nI Can't think of another Republican whose journey from the anti Trump outraged approach from obscene ... was quite so illogical or half us out and have such as that you are auditioning\nFor a play is Jeff Sessions as attorney general your response or a Frank\nYou don't know what you're talking about in your world Frank is a noble cause to destroy a judicial candidates whose conservative think Thomas lido for now have enough on bipartisan point at night than [noise]\nUh I Try to have a good disposition costs are like my job but don't mistake that I don't care about the conservative cause so if I made you upset because I Would not want to generalize McCarthyism than good and I think I can survive in South Carolina is\nWell you know the thing is is that um I think Lindsey Graham needs to get off the [laughter] that was what he\nReally thinks first of all I think it is going to be a positive if he's campaigning I'm a second of all I think the momentum from the from uh the uh the outrage that he delivered a there on Capitol Hill that day\nI think will I I think that is that needs to be carried through but not just through the election not just through the mid term election it needs to be carried through in that attitude needs to be carried through\nA on important things that that ah the matter beyond that including a legislative items and other and and who knows what kind of a nomination process we may go through a while a Trump still president but uh you know making some very solid point\nOr the left was going to you know they used to him it when it's convenient that's what they do they point to the right ah Lindsey Graham and the you know since Trump has been president anything that doesn't go along with you know any comment ah that that counters the president the left one do you use that\nAnd and and\nAnd really kind of a position Lindsey Graham to be the by porters and willing to cross the aisle Republican that John McCain was\nAnd in some ways he was but\nOf course you're demonized now you're Hitler because you stand for something on its merits you stand for something based on the behavior of the left and you were outraged and rightly so\nWell you know the thing is and reading Frank Bruni is calm in the New York times that none of it relates to the actual\nCase and what he was talking about there it's it's it's about the fact that Lindsey Graham has had differences with Donald Trump right and you know in Trump is you know been in a Trump has been meaning to him and called them names and things like that and there's been an animosity between the two and therefore\n[laughter] somehow Lindsey Graham shouldn't be taking Trump's side with Trump's candidate I mean it\nSeems that really doesn't get what we said earlier this whole cabinet thing wasn't about Trump\nIt really wasn't a Bernie doesn't get that and I don't know I I have to go back on and and count the number of comments made for or against Trump or from Lindsey Graham\nBut Lindsey Graham's ah when she issued this concern that day or a week ago last Thursday\nIt was based on the lack of merits of the case and the and and on the larger a much to a larger extent are pretty much the treatment\nOf Kavanaugh by the Democrats and and not\nThe not the liberals with the signs outside look the Democrats on the committee Frank\nBruni has nothing to read the article he's got nothing well he's angry he's yeah they're they're they're wrong as I've said we discuss this for the last two and a half weeks\nWe didn't have anyone I Am not seen any rational thought or critical thinking statement come from the mainstream media or the Democrats to say that the position that I hold and you hold which would be similar\nOld which wouldn't be similar in this particular case to Lindsey Graham yeah where is flawed\nAt all\nExcept for rhetoric and bringing up other things that have nothing to do with this case with this nomination process with the witnesses and the allegations that came forward every\nSingle point that we have made which are the same what I can see as Lindsey Graham are all legit and the oldest is going to drop them nuts and moral and correct\nRice and you're wrong and reading Frank Bernie's column in the New York times you're a simple pin Mr Bruni\nTalk about the actual things that Lindsey Graham brought up gold point by point and say any of the things that he said we're wrong you can't do that because then you'd be lying\nTo\nThem I mean it is again a the they just black the will to have the debate they don't have the debate you cannot the debate so they have to step up and now everyone what Lindsey Graham said on that day so they do what\nWell they used to be for Trump now he's against Trump that's basically the gist of it right\n\nWell from their world absolute loyalty is expected as we've said in the real world it's I like this candidate for this don't like him for this all the right over there that's a good nominate that's a that's a good nomination pick over there\nLike that I don't like this real people and critical thinking people and people with rational thought Mr Bernie can do that\nOh I can say that there are plenty of times I disagreed with Lindsey Graham and I might in the future\nYou are you running for attorney general right [laughter] I Wonder if you've been in general what are you trying to get out ... exactly exactly well that's it he's only doing this well again that's because you can debate the points that he made the only point you have as he was against Trump and now he's four trough\nWe we've said with the simple ten you know a arguments that will never and I called them simple ten arguments because they never directly go after the the particulars of an issue that we are discussing they always tried to bring up side issues that aren't\nAren't even a pertinent to what you're discussing right\nAnd you read British telling me like what about the allegations he made that they're not wrong you're just saying he's kissing Trump's fought to become attorney general yeah you know evidence of that you're not contradicting the points that he made your simply saying he's making it and he shouldn't be making it because\nHe was one of the most fierce anti Trump hers and now he's agreeing with him and if you disagree with Trump you must always disagree with Trump which of course is hogwash yes\n\nThat it it it is the insanity of the left and and again uh they ... well ... it's funny because they used to uh pretend to be the side that had the greater intellect\n[laughter] still trying to tell you that they are no they don't but it is the ... the they keep going for the low hanging fruit band and the and and really the brunt of the argument right now is well he's just trying to get something out of Trump or he used to hate Trump but now he likes drop\nDebate him on the points made on that day\nMr Bernie can't can't do it eight six six Ninety

judge word to possibly a super slander a stock report or\nOther not whatever his name is uh uh I think that men do some I think I think it may slow them down a little bit in their efforts to agree with you guys are going to continue to describe it um but I think that if judge were super slander or level a\nHe's a private citizen ... he ... he's not on the same rules of capping off down or anybody else in public office he's a private citizen who was\nWhen I brought him I think it would slow them down I think that we give them food food for thought yeah I I mean\nYou look at it and it seems like a Dr ... her attorneys are are looking to basically\nNot pursue this any further um maybe there's something there and maybe there's ... they've already heard from judge ... or ... or is lawyers but certainly at the very least we can say what we do know is factors that he would have a case or is he willing to pursue that or not is the question but\nUm he would be looking to protect his name I mean it would be something that I Would pursue because my name was ... was made public\nA through this with with the league and everything else ah that's and and who else would be responsible in that chain of events with the leaked to the media and all of that I I think you could probably ... here's what's interesting\nYou the names were brought out as a result of the leak\nForward as far as we know she didn't leak it so if that if that law or pursued we would likely find out who leaked it because what responsibility do they have in a case\nBrought by ... by march judge and or his lawyers whoever leaked to the media would also be partially responsible are forgetting his name out there\nAnd that you could see I think ... part of that and you have in any case that was that was him yes ... eliminate because they're getting the of the gang rape that yes you're right that's clear yes right\nRight right the only possibility of backlash on ... you wouldn't want to put his good buddy ... they already the wind is yeah yeah you know got tempered problems I wouldn't want them to think that they're good at issue in this in spite is used to do this for a spy and\nYeah well they you know it's it would be ... it it would definitely play out in terms of the spin on it it would play out\nUh in every ... up predictable and even some are unpredictable ways we can we can try and come they use our imagination to come up with things and and thank you a market for the call we appreciate it and and I think a fair point or question\nUh he definitely would have standing as you point out Gary and pointed out during this process\nUh you you know you're into the political arena when you accept the nomination a as a cap Kavanaugh did\nAnd and so you would have to go out of your way to prove that malice uh but in this case of a mark judge a that wouldn't he wouldn't have that burden\nBut you you do wonder about you know I guess the future of claims of this these particular claims um and really the only one that that survived at all was Dr ... claim\nAnd and it it appears they do not want to pursue that any further so\nWhy I and and I think you make a case that that his name was released because of the leak and so yeah he wasn't trying to link it to the ... a a media but in the ... case yeah\nTo me that would even be a ... and again I don't know who leaked it so I I don't know I'm just I'm On the doctor or right I'm just using ... that that is a possible exception here right ah but with the other case\nTo me that's clear I mean going going after cab at all with an allegation like that that those things are made of politicians all the time right and there are public figures for the law used them differently yeah but if you're a private citizen you're dragged into it\nAnd you're being accused of a gang rape mhm spiking drinks you know like things like that or you just you can't say you just can't go out and print that right ... and say that about people right especially private citizens mhm\nThat says then you've got to make your case and say worse the probable cause while I think it might have happened\nMhm because then you've got to make your case it's the worst of probable cause while I think it might have happened that's not good enough no no absolutely not so I'd like to just to ... personally\nHaven't actually asked them directly I don't believe they did it but I have not asked them if they did directly\nLet's go to Gary in sparks Nevada Gary urine rather radio walk into the show\n[laughter] Hi how are you cutter and got his um\nThe Republicans they came for complaining about all the things that the Democrats do but they never a press charges against anybody slice for for perjury or Hillary Clinton or Dianne Feinstein and so on it's like telling a bank robber I'm complaining about it\nThough we're not going to hell whoa whoa where's the perjury potty approved the perjury\nHow do you prove their perjury prime well you know ... if you don't want to take that one guy and finds fang\nOkay well I Know but you know ... well my point is legal point by point by\nWhat you alleged they should do so you're blowing out your first point you don't go after Ford so then who do you charge next than on if you're not going to charge poured who's the next one\nOkay Dianne Feinstein with it would share the spy a at a chauffeur\nWell I Believe that there should be an investigation do I believe than yes of course\nRight I I I Believe there should be investigation they are not so I Would agree with you on that\nAnd I believe they have that in their promise I ... I Believe they're promising that there will be an investigation they want to look into that\nBut they never make that charge or any kind of Hillary Clinton's emails there's\nWell that one that ... that's ... that's followed that wasn't Republicans fault no I don't buy\nThat was ... who clearly was politically driven and then that's something you couldn't control in that moment right\nWell do you expect they the Democrats just stop doing any of\nThese now without which are what are they get them but what does this behavior get them ultimately in twenty sixteen mass of loss\nIt is but because of the reason Gary that they bring it up on Capitol Hill that somebody an elected office would bring these up by these items up on Capitol Hill because\nWe said about uh you know if you go back to uh the email thing with a with Hillary or even back to lying about been God's the which wasn't enough itself with crime although it should be but it isn't a you look and see what exactly what we've said\nIs that on the email specifically on the email or investigation and the whole no reasonable prosecutor would would uh prosecuted we said well\nIt what matters fears the court of public opinion what you're dead and ultimately she lost in November of twenty sixteen and and thank you for the call\nIt is not always that that and not that she's above the law or we believe they should have pursued that but I if given a choice having her in jail or is not as great as not having her in the White House\nYou know here's here's the uh the the the point about four to ... maybe he was responding Gary and sparks Nevada was responding to when we were talking to the last caller about a mark judge following\nA defamation of character lawsuit well when you when you go after a private citizen you have to at least have some type of evidence that this happened a he said she said\nA of a of a private citizen can get you into trouble but still might not go to the level of perjury perjury as you would have to prove you would have to have another witness stating she's lying about it but\nUh you know ... or it was you know about you know I I don't I'm\nTrying to think of ones you know somebody has been hit with defamation of character right when it's something that is just so obvious can't be true mhm uh and and so my point was I I don't know\nThe doctor Ford situation is there in the realm of possibility she's committing perjury absolutely sure yeah or any things in the wrong because we don't know we don't know anything about it because nobody can collaborated so we don't know what she what she wants to it's proving it\nIs and and our point was is Eric just said that well there are costs to the Democrats lost twenty sixteen uh there there may be repercussions here in this upcoming election where they don't\nAh when the seats that they should be winning\nA in a first term of a president in the first midterm afterwards that almost always the party in power loses seats ... that may not happen a Supreme Court justice was ah was confirmed mhm uh and United a\nPretty fractured Republican Party\nUh was confirmed mhm uh and United a pretty fractured Republican Party so it isn't always that\nYour punishment is criminal sometimes the punishment is criminal as for Dianne Feinstein though a and Clinton as we explained Clinton wasn't the Republicans and so if you're angry that justice isn't always done\nAll I can say is this from our point of view the most important things to get the truth out there yes that's what I Want I Want transparency I Want the truth I Can't do anything if the majority because one of the reasons that Hillary Clinton\nWas never charged because there's a majority there's probably half of America even if they knew she was guilty would wander charged right sorry but that's just the way that it is part of the power comes from public opinion\nAnd it doesn't matter whether she committed a crime or not they don't want her prosecuted\nMhm and\nSo the best we can do is get out the truth and we know the truth about Hillary\nA worry we know I'm\nOf bumping gossipy for example Susan Rice sugar and salt we laugh when you said she said you know the ... that she would like to ... she would instead of running against colon seems like an excuse me you're on the ... and ... now it wasn't a criminal offense but it was still line\nAbout a terrorist attack that killed Americans and everyone in the United states knows its ally for everyone in the United states you could take them and you can show them the law that Hillary Clinton broke right there you could read the law\nAnd and everybody would an agreement that is what she did and it would still be half of America that said so what you should be able to get away with it and can't do anything about it the best that we can hope for\nIn any thing is that the truth is told and I don't know what's going to happen in the FBI investigation right\nI don't know if it's going to show corruption it's now in the inspector general hands Michael Horowitz you and I talked about this it's the one story that's been buried completely over the last two weeks ...\nIs that when Trump said okay we're you know we we we've got a couple of allies to don't want us to relieve some of this information and uh so we're going to give it to Michael I have an eddy we went that doesn't make a ... my ... we're going to give it to Michael Horowitz from like ...\n[laughter] don't give it to my colleagues Minnesota them and I don't have the [laughter] whatever you do\nGive it to Michael Horowitz the inspector general you and I said to each other this was on the air when we went\nDown to ... because it doesn't make any sense why would they give it to the inspector general the department of justice if if they want to figure out how they can release it and and still you know keep some of it redacted they would go to\nOh wait a minute inspector general only deals with corruption more improprieties right oh\nYes and and that that story has been buried and analysis of that story's been buried by the mainstream media why would the president not release it immediately\nAnd give it to the inspector general of the department of justice because he deals with corruption\nAnd so we don't know what's going to happen there but get us the truth and if the American people if they get the truth and still decide to do the wrong thing that's on them yeah and that's\nThat that's really what it comes down to is that uh we've been calling for transparency\nOn on all of it\nThe whole Russians scandal thing we've said multiple times regardless of where it falls politically as long as that is fully transparent and the process the American people can decide\nBecause we can't change what people do it in the past nobody can not even the people that did it\nAnd my question would be that if the Democrats took the house do they really really really
