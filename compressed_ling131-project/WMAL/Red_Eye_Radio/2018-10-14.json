you go to the to the the farm belt\nThat's everything what's the impact right now of terrorists politically vote\nFor Republicans and in twenty twenty ... at the mid term this year and in twenty twenty for the president and his reelection because keep in mind they may support Republicans who are on board for terrorists this time and twenty Eighteen at the midterms\nAre they going to support the president who owns it completely if it's still ongoing in twenty twenty\nNot surprised by what happened the last couple of days you know you and I talked about it but\nAnd we said look the big terrorists were hit on September twenty eight [laughter] so I'm not surprised that when you look at you know steel and aluminum and how they have skyrocketed since the beginning of the year right and we said look eventually it's going to be a point where the market's going to say look you're raising prices too uh too much and when the terrorists went into effect on September twenty eight\nOr when the president is trying to get Iran a you know the sanctions on Iran which means the world oil market is going to you know increase the cost of oil even though we are producing\nA more when steel aluminum or up when we uh we have been told the fourth quarter could be hit because of the two hundred billion dollars in tariffs at ten percent that went in\nAs a turning September twenty eight eventually the market's going to react to that you can't raise raising the cost of doing business is never a positive for the economy right but everything that we've talked about and everything that every financial magazine has talked about\nAbout why the stock market has been hit has been due to what government action mhm regulation tech companies for a terrorist the the the the fed our our

L. more Washington comes to talk [noise]\nAids\nRide I radio he is currently in I'm Gary McNamara eight six six Ninety or read I\nWe go to Mary Ann in Michigan Marianne welcome you're on red eye Radio Welcome to the show\nA high I really interested in what you're talking about and about the stock market going down there the number of reasons I said including perhaps a political agenda with respect to some businesses\nSuch a thing about it's about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that which is why it was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo its horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here because then prices would\nAnd you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here\nBecause then prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be due to retail doors shutting wrapped and write a if the opposite for ... you would go in a massive recession if\nWe had a policy that we produce everything in this country prices of goods and services would skyrocket through the roof\nA a again because it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe\nI well it depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point a to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\n... really one of the most under reported stories of the entire year ...\nIs that the United states\nIs now on an happened about three weeks ago became the number one producer of oil in the world mhm\nYeah [noise] um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason I continue supporting a or the uh the the president his tax bill ... way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter]\nThat'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the line to you that right\nSo the but but you put in place all of those dynamics for a great economy and all the it's working up until what the ... three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that U.S policy put in place that doesn't need to be there what they'll\nWin and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even a for the most part are not that you couldn't have done a few things different in in TPP but remember the great victories of the dairy with Canada was already in the ...\nCannot had already agreed to that yeah I'm a you know ... before so that was lauded as a great victory and uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided you know not to uh to take that you and I went through and\nAnd uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old NAFTA the biggest victories that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed a was the fact that the tariffs worked to get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember two of the president's major goals his goals his stated goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent mhm\nUh and\nUh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the what were the because at the president's trying to make the terrorists are worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know it produces them in the United states\nHe's and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods to you know it produces them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry are now\nYou you talk about you know the farmers so I mean you if you\nIf you say\nIt's a very populous viewpoint right we need to help the farmer\nBut when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\nUh you know set of before a few minutes ago but they feed the world that food goes all over the world um\nYou know and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that you gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business\nThat's what we need and and that's the because forget about the political pots president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about\nRetaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's ... I mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably scrambling\n... of of getting things die as you said it was it like it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday that China and\nAnd that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a ... you know the uh the supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nBut wait\nHe was a master negotiator why does he need to fret threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to go she Asian done he's a master negotiator he doesn't need to do that\nWell as I said you know ... and again in ... we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA right\nWell and that's it except for the\nYou know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share\nFor the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually but the president did allow what what we except for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall\nWas that worth the loss of business with the terrorists that the president\nHas put on that does raise the cost of goods and services and affected the cost of raw materials\nAnd other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule right because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas the automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made and so some ah some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour ... some have to do that won't find you just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker\nRight ah and even with the was it uh I think it was a Wall Street journal said Boston I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that\nBut the other thing the president want to do is make sure that we could in the United states sell our vehicles overseas\nBecause of that but the other than the president want to do is make sure that\nWe could in the United states seller vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his cap on what what Mexico you know could send us in cars\nBefore other terrorists hit\n... we have an ... they haven't reached that cap and car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that promote Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars uh with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states and the other states was only selling six thousand to begin with\nBy reaching this milestone you can be a part of an elite club of drivers who share remarkable safety records and demonstrate superior driving skills\nIf you or someone you know as a truck driver with a million miles or more driving was outer preventable accident register online at red eye radio show dot com that's right I radio show dot com\nThe red eye radio million mile club would not be possible without the support of our great sponsors including Petro stopping centers\nHow's lubricate or the ... family of companies motel six the sink Christopher fond cats scale\nAnd corporal products we applaud the individual truckers athletes who drive with care and keep our highways say oh you are they all of them were rich W a male Washington\nShot one thousand dollar time\nYou'll you M.

that affected me uh by the time we got to Monday show the one thing that was sticking in my mind I thought to myself\nWow you know what are they trying to sell us and our we buying it\nWhat they were trying to sell us was um if you believe in due process if you believe in the presumption of innocence\nIf you believe that an allegation alone uh especially on cooperated\n... um allegations are\nAnd not only that but the witness was a huge don't back you up if you don't buy into that completely the allegation and you believe in due process under the law you are a rapist enabler\nThat's what they were trying to sell the American people\nWill see in a few weeks whether\nA part of America bought into what they were selling the polls so far show that they have not\nThe other thing is we found out that the\nSo far show that they have not the other thing is we found out that the Democrats really don't have an issue\nYou go into different races and they will talk about some of the issues out there but overall if you were to ask Americans\nWhat is the issue that the Democrats are promoting what is this specific issue when you think about this election by the way his that question asked in a poll\n\nWhich question would that be specifically about what is the one issue that's driving you to the polls what is the one of the major issues of this election season\nAnecdotally mhm my my granddaughter's\nUm and and I I Try and step back and take my bias away you know and look at the facts you know in that situation as I assessed their generation the oldest of which is a is Thirteen\nAh and then there I have to twelve year olds as well so you know those those early teens that's when you start forming right opinions but you are very curious about how the world works and all of that\nAnd and so I I ask them questions about their friends you know just about behavior okay so you know I like social media is not is very different for them Twitter and Facebook that even on the radar\nNot even but\nAlso how things are presented to them\nYou don't want one of my granddaughters a few years ago it was\nA it was ... they were they were showing a video on nine eleven\nAnd they had put sad music to it\nAnd then she asked me that following weekend when she was at the house but what do you think of that I said well I don't know she goes to have you ever heard the song and she named the song they were using and I said yeah yeah yeah she said I said that she goes I don't know why they did that I said well why do you think they did that she goes to manipulate my feelings\n\nIn something that was already sad\nThat just one observation again forget the fact that it's my granddaughter ... case was of what I was a critical thinking but it was critical thinking about manipulation and and the left has been all about manipulation and politically both sides are but\nIs that next generation and we've seen it we've seen their studies that show well\nThe ... the generation basically behind a the the college age or college graduates now is showing more critical\nThinking and and not that they would be conservative but if they are assessing things for what they are instead of the fantasy that the left promotes are they the future of below\nWe talked about drawing lumber who is the uh the uh uh uh a climate a professor that believes that yeah probably a a you know the greenhouse gases are causing global warming believes that everything the left is doing is actually doing the opposite\nSeven the opposite effect right it's actually producing and we've talked about this before but you just pointed out however ... ways because that's the way the world is doing the opposite when you when your solutions are making the problem worse but you're signing an agreement\nTo make it better mhm that's considered better than if you're actually don't sign the agreement to do things that will make it worse\nAnd you go out on your own and you do the things that will never want to get you cheaper energy and reduce greenhouse gases you're considered the devil right because you won't get along with the\nUh international community and sign an agreement all pretending to do something but if you actually do the things that you wish to do or you claim they're going to do you're actually going to do the opposite of what your original goal was well\nBecause we've ... we've been talking about for a long time the scientific community should be having this discussion not to find who go ... going to win the debate but to find out if we can actually predict what kinds of cyclists coming because that can affect\nAh that that can affect crops and everything else which can be devastating and also what's it if if man is causing a which by the way hasn't been proven\nOr if something's happening happening that we can react to ahead of time and protect a the population out of time [noise] eight six six Ninety red eye\nWas gilly McNamara and regardless of

you know have they looked at the president said\nLook Republicans in the day they look and they just they were voting\nAnd does that make their money off of it have they you know have they looked at the president said\nLook Republicans ... they they look and they just say we're voting against the party of the president if it's true it's the bottom was saying that it's weak in the mid west for the Republicans is it because of the terrorists and agriculture well and and that's it uh there\nAre I think right now if you look at the the farming community especially sending that message back to the president and the administration\nOn you know giving the money is saying they would rather have the business or that shows that they believe this could be long term pain for video world law here is

the people that love when he'd ... when he does that still love him\nBut it's not going to change what sort of think about it who can in this day and age how can tend to twelve percent possibly be undecided and ... and and most definitely be going to the polls in November\nYeah yeah ... it's really it's certainly when you think about that here's something else interesting looking at the ... and it's\nJust one small indicators of small movement but I find it interesting looking at our sci fi and the map for the house race or the house races\nSo Republicans took one from the Democrats I haven't figured out which one it is but it was at two o five Democrats in other words likely very likely Democrats\nAnd one Ninety eight for Republicans it's now too old for for Democrats one Ninety nine for Republicans and the center of the toss up districts still remains at thirty to hurry to yes\nI Would love to see what your district that was that that that that shifted and I and again not from toss up\nBut from the Democrats so I'll go back and look at it I I have no idea um but it is interesting so you but you do look at those started to keep in mind to Eighteen is the number the magic number a for a majority right so right now\nOnly Nineteen to those thirty to need to go for uh the Republicans but even fewer uh fourteen only need to go for the Democrats\nSo\nIt will be interesting to watch those house races as we start seeing the polls are and we and we will more and more are in the coming weeks that's going to be I'd be I think by the time we get back a week from Monday\nThings will start shaping up because those undecideds more and more of them will start making up their mind and that that's where a shift happens and what is the impact\nOf the capital and that entire thing\nAnd really me and my ... for example in Montana isn't a toss up state right with test or you know up or the last one was done not you know nine twenty two\nWhich had test her up for the one before and and uh with the margin of error three point seven ... and the one before that was test her up just to why isn't that a toss up said why is that definitely on the on the Senate race yeah unemployment rate right and and so ... my point is so yeah it is the legitimacy of\nThe ... the average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are a lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and\n[noise] I guess historically can shift happened\nAh with ... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done by the recent polls that were done in that race or the the uh you know test her up by by four and the grab us a margin of error is three point seven so that\nYou know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error once we ought to consider is not a toss up that's my point my point is that it's our sleepy has it has definitely blue\nMm\nOn my map but still showing great it's just one gray\nMm\nOn my map it still showing great it's just one gray\nI just sit there and get it when it just went crazy I thanks to the staff at our safety for ... it was it that way of what happened that just when it just when gray yeah All right I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it's just one great ... tiny grain asked myself I've got no wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and they'll look at the end when you're pause and all of a sudden updates its gray in front of me yeah\nBecause ... Arizona was in grade before\nAir Arizona was like blue with flashes or what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to have sat next because of mix Sally\nAll of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great and\nThat because Mick Sally there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls\nAre going from All right I'm going to al Marri Sienna ... and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing different pollster\nBut it is a it's it's a pretty big swing so um and it is a it's a different uh the pollster in fact I'm well\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the our CPA Senate map and the one next week is the Senate know toss up\nOkay they don't include any taught some Senate ... what I was okay that's what I was ... I Know that if you click that that's and I thought that was their general analysis oh right right and it makes sense now\nBecause that was like wait a how can you call a can't Montana not be a toss up at this point right All right question answered oh by the way the wrong map out the the New York times\nCNN poll this life pull that continues basically uh you know four days up until the election actually look at Tennessee Blackburn now ah on the days ten eight to ten eleven Blackburn now ahead by fourteen\nWhat'd you say it was a political that did the article on bread ascendant and his volunteers right furious the fact that he said he would have endorsed Kevin ...

S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices\nOn Amazon\nThey do want him to things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or\nThey pass it along to the consumer ... plain and simple\nOr this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier ... for those of you that her brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly and update you so you understand completely what we're talking about\nUh the Democrats accused the Trump a campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change the outcome of the election mhm the evidence we found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a Laufer\nPerkins ... who paid and opposition research from\n... a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting on verified salacious allegations against Donald Trump\nThat they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of\nThe twenty sixteen election they also use that information as a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a ... well\nThe co founder of the opposition research from Glen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n...\nReally know the average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty ninth\nOr after the lawyer said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons from a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign by the law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\n... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the pro ... was a thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course all or is going to say you're not trying to get to the true\nFor them what does the ... say they're trying to fight here's our either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think that's all right are are they going to ask him about a a who\nHe believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you were listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nUh I don't think so what are they going to ask him about finding I Would I Begin to ask him about Kanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their role\nOr in the uh entire flowed charge of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the and an associate deputy attorney general\nUh\nThe inspector general would have then access to\nAccess to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he oh he but he yes from the department of justice yes yes yes because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on unofficial yes device from the department and I and then again\nIf those are ... that that's a number of it right away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because your GPS doesn't want to cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut ah so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce for his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they\nWere on a those devices if they're still preserved in any way\nWe we know you have the you know you have the right to claim fifth mhm you have to incriminate yourself yes and we understand than what I Would wonder is a\nBlend Simpsons lawyer ... what is he worried about if they aren't let let's take him at his word mhm that the house Judiciary Committee\nAnd the house oversight committee aren't trying to get to the truth right then I Would ask ... lawyer\nThen what do you think they're going after right\nIf they're not well look I ... ... is is part of what they hypothetically as part of what they are concerned with is the same thing as a Mueller investigation\nThe Mueller investigation has had nothing to do with actual Russian collusion with the Trump campaign right so that would be the question are you worried because of where the mother investigations is going is at the same thing might happen to you\nThat there was nothing wrong that you did nothing wrong and I don't know I don't I don't know what I don't see any crime from what I Know\nOf of fusion GPS committing any crime\nI don't know of one I don't know where there was any evidence of that you would uh concerning you know get gathering the information and getting the money from ... third opposition research firm that just on the level is is that is what you do you get dirt on the other\nParty's\nCandidate or whatever you you do off as well the what they do opposition research is self explanatory so what does he worried about\n\nWhat would they be what possible crimes is Glenn Simpsons lawyer worried about\nWell\nAnaheim and the time like this interesting look I say this because Donald Trump junior I testify I'll go under I'll I'll ... there are plenty of people that don't wander oh mhm so what is the crime that he is ... ... what is the charge\nThat Glenn Simpsons lawyer if you talk to him privately would be concerned about even if he believes his client did not commit a crime where does he think they're going\nTo try to prove that Glenn Simpson committed a crime and why would they be going after Glenn Simpson\n\nOr is there someone else their fusion GPS he's worried about and by talking forget about incriminating himself he's incriminating\nHis from yes\nThose are the questions that went to ... those are questions on the investigator would have run into their ... yes that's all we're not indicting anybody", "show_name": "Red Eye Radio", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington", "day": "14"}
