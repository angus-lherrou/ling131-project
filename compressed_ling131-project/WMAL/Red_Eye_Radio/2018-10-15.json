teachable moment I'm\nFor all for all Americans so I think the to the Democrats have not learned their lesson and ... says\nShown the door they treated Kevin all and the\nAnd the and the Supreme Court cheering\nSo um [noise] they assumed that they could slander and ... a person that they disagreed with politically um than get their way but\nUm [noise] then they've been doing the same to [noise] to trial for two years but\nUh it's really come to a head when she was a cab and all of the nation and I think we need to use the midterms to show and clearly that that's not the way to do politics in America [noise]\nWhat what is needed in America is\nThe parties to to debate the issues then to use reason [noise] for\nToo but you know they come yeah they they don't go ahead\n...\nThat's yeah that's been there playbook though not just since the last two years with Trump\nTheir play book and I remember Harry Reid saying that Romney didn't pay his taxes here from someone in your middle later on I was a lie but it said it was effective well they'll do anything in the book and the worry is it looks like they could win a house of representatives and if they do you can't imagine what the next two years of going to be like for President Trump and for all that's run\nThat tried and it's it's the idea that\nYou're selfish and justify yourself which means some that's what the Democrats are using as they're guiding principle of their self ... are are justified by their selfish Maine's some\n... up and they also think they have truth on their side they're arrogant as I said\nAnd when you arrogant and you think if you think you have the truth than you could do anything right at the end of the ... the means are justified by the ends right or the actually either way you said it works because they just feel they can say anything and do anything because we're evil and they're good\nWill actually thought they could overturn a\nTwo hundred years of jurors prudent suit in the cabin on

to the desert southwest will continue to see rain today in South Texas now as you move a little closer into Colorado along I twenty five\nYeah well I I Would suggest to that you you know keep up a fight with people who are willing to listen and try to work on those people who might be persuaded by the facts many people don't know right they live their lives they work hard at their jobs and the you know they tune in occasionally maybe that's why the Kavanaugh hearings will be effective\nBecause I think to me the great majority of people were not happy about the way he was treated and and what went on there the idea\nThat allegations are enough\nTo convict you at least in people's minds or some people is is outraged is against the whole system where you're innocent until proven guilty he was guilty just because he was accused of it\nAnd so maybe that influence on people I think people are going to be surprised by the elections what Robert I I think of your call and hang in there okay\nThank you thank you very much twenty five there is hope let's go to a\nOkay David you think people are voting for or a dead huh go ahead David in Cedar Rapids OK\nI'm OK what is it is just the uh after my grandfather and my mother and my\nGrandmother ... passed away a notice that um [noise] I joined the sheer links county Republican caucus committee got people who are at the polls show\nWho uh it'll take a look at you know all of sudden you know then they see how people are voting\nAnd I've noticed that you know when looking for records that for some reason my grandfather and my grandmother and my mother all voted for Obama twice even though they die before [noise]\nDid you report it to anybody I tried to take some action [noise]\nI I did and it's just that it it was kind of like a yelling at a stone wall\n[noise] they weren't willing ... [laughter] yeah no\nThis is a real problem with voting integrity in this country\nAnd we've known for years that people in Chicago that people voted in Chicago but now across the country there are people voting in your case you twice they voted for Obama I mean if you don't have integrity election system anything could happen it's amazing when you look back on it that Trump won that Bush won\nBecause I Believe that we're finding that kind of fraud so\nThat people who wrote in in California you you know you can vote by DMV and they admitted that thousands of people voted there they said there was some snakes with voting machines we get a real problem when you can't trust the outcome of the election [noise]\nWell the thing is is that how the ... county Republican caucus committee change\nHere in Cedar Rapids pledge that we got a whole new Patrick people in all ... people actually interested and say I'm going to make sure my it's all it's actually counted\nAnd so we are all these younger people says I Love this idea I'm just going to make sure that this guy over here that I don't trust\nIs being equal [noise] and that's how we changed from Democrats city to a Republican city getting this last election\nWell that's good so there's still some good news even despite the fraudulent voted by the way that doesn't take into account illegal immigrants right\nIs illegal immigrants are voting and that's my whole point that's another topic if we ever allow illegal immigrants devoted to Republicans aren't going another election at least nationally uh in in our lifetime or there's no hope when you let people vote who aren't qualified or are not citizens of United States\nYou brought up a great election\nActually got to get her get a little ... that they're [noise] okay it's all depends on how you treat the individual\nIf she tree unless people who may be here illegally\nBut are contributing to society because I worked on many aware out at the agency jobs where there are plenty of illegals that were working there\nBut as long as you treat them like human beings and you know being angry because they're illegal just realized that our system which helps for so long that we know integrated people that you know and uh\nJust realize that our system the shelves for so long that we know integrated people that you know and uh and another you know why they should have been there and the first place but because they are good to us that we are good to them\n[noise] maybe the idea that illegals would probably vote Republican is not a question\nNot the problem is it's not just because it's tied to want to get on to our topic necessarily the problem is\nIf you don't have a a way of entering the country legally than your sovereignty your borders me nothing I mean there's a big topic I don't want to go into it yeah I certainly think people should be treated well\nBut whether they should be allowed into your country is another issue you have borders or you don't\nBut I don't want to open up that you know for us right now uh you know ... it's bigger than just a few minutes it is not a matter of treat them well in fact I\nDon't even know I teach at night and many of my students may not be here legally they the great people that's not the point I fault the government for not having a system that makes sense for all of us that's the real issue\nAnd speaking of issues let me know what you think at eight six six Ninety red eye that's also eight six six or seven thirty three thirty nine let's see we have time for another call was\nIn the segment Charles been waiting Sheryl in spots where does that New Jersey ...

I guarantee you\nThe house will lose twenty seats at least minimum Republican Party and we haven't been able to weed out these rhino slobs diehard sending us to the left\n[noise] yeah well I Do agree with you as you said you agreed with me in part I Do agree with you that the Republicans are probably gonna lose the house now I don't want to um usually an optimist [laughter] but I just want to be real it doesn't I don't know how many seats it takes twenty something [noise]\nBut the fact is that um we're in trouble and it doesn't look good because the member the house is done on an individual basis or\nArea by areas state by state so it sure seems to me that uh we're in trouble and we could easily or lose a house represents I don't think we're going to lose the Senate but we are going to lose the house of representatives if\nEnough people don't go out and vote is very very scary what's happening let's go to a how 'bout that Curtis in Graham North Carolina Curtis you're on with mark\n[laughter] Hi [noise] okay [noise] well [noise] um [noise] I\nKind of agree with what that last caller saying about the much rhinos some destroying their base I'll tell you what the civil war he was actually the first civil war has been going on and says before the constitution even started even happened like you [laughter] and I have for first about slavery and then\nWhen the storm civil war got hot [laughter] and they ended up losing them of course they were angry they stood up the\nKKK and they've been sleeping all the people now and they were going to be the masters and that's pretty

got to defend it you've got to fight hard for it and that's part of my message tonight if you don't get out there and vote we're going to be in trouble let's go to Fred in Tallahassee, Florida Fred you're on was marked\nBy a marker for it real well how are you doing I'm ... yeah the uh\nThe civility in our country should the Obama administration is known to pot oh\nThat is just go to pot oh\nNo he was big into one that has a lot\nMore started biting my love the first ... long for on boats you only got impeach but and that was a real sport\nOh my dad was a staunch conservative but him and all the child was dead bodies are needed to go there\nAnd done all kinds of stuff you know you might be a different party in every few different ideas but you got alone and you know you can have a conversation without it turning into a fish but about ball\nThat are expecting one thing and then they go vote and they don't know what they voted for too you know growing up everybody's always like okay you're voted good account but it doesn't really count if you're not voting for something you don't really understand so\nThat's really all I Want it to me or now just to make sure everybody's knowing that it be before you\nGo in and sounds like you to go but I I'll say that everybody else out there the fact is I'm not one of those people that wants to make it easier for people to vote\nI think if you don't know enough about what's going on and you don't care enough to go out of your way the vote I have a feeling you're not one of my voters that you're going to do it based on emotions and feelings which is what the other side is anyway to begin with\nAs opposed to as our caller just said\nA knowing the facts and and knowing the issues and that's what can you don't have to agree with me but at least go in there and don't do based on emotion you you hate President Trump so much or he he's a man and you know we don't want to listen and so you're the woman I remember that was years ago maybe it is again\nThe vote for him because they don't share your philosophy or your principles of course there's another issue\nWhich is as a teacher part time teacher I can tell you this most students don't know our point of view what I often use is the minimum wage laws they'll say oh of course I Want my re uh want to get a raise or what do they call it also not just minimum wage livable wage I Love that one like it's a job of a business this may sound heartless\nJob of a business to give you a livable wage no it's not\nIt's a job I teach economics job of business to make a profit if they don't make a profit they won't be around you won't have any work or they won't hire you or the lay you off when they won't hire your friends\nThat have the job of a business to give you a livable wage and it's not the job of governments to decide what wage to give you\nThat's what the Soviet Union did last week communism is that's what's socialism is and as most young people they've never heard the other side where does money come from I said that for years people do not know including adults not just young people young adults\nThat the government has no money to tone it just takes it in ... from some group of people in the foreign attacks and give us gives it the others when students here the snake I never heard that\nI never heard that before the conservatives couldn't win it's a harder thing to explain\nA than just being emotional and say you know whatever livable wage pro choice global warming of course the change the climate change when it gets very cold just saying these catchy things they left and the Democrats are much better at that and conservatives are\nTakes a while to explain why they shouldn't be a minimum wage or if there is you you just can't raise that arbitrarily or the government should do it some ... do it\nIt takes a long time to explain capitalism why that's the best system ever created so far\n... this is tough to be on on our side it takes a while and if you have a meeting against or oh good luck it's a wonder we win any elections is one of the President Trump won with all the things stacked against him\nA and let's go to David in Greenwich uh let's see where that is in Greenwich New Jersey it sounds like fire\nDavid [noise]\nMorning thanks for taking my phone call um I I guess ... points on that you know President Trump is hated for what he says\nAnd and I get it it's not for what he does you know let's not forget in this country that on President Obama came in I didn't vote for him but I like them as charismatic\nThe money in this country and you should know this uh from as you're teaching the money in this country dried up and it went back up on the shelf\nIronically it comes right back out again President Trump cannot force corporations to invest money or make things happen\nI mean he's a businessman he's a wheel on your show he's hated for what he said\nNot what he's done second I think the people in this country should understand that the Democratic and Republican Party are are are corporations\nJust like if you and I wanted to start our own right I radio corporation political party we could do it too so when they take us so personally thinking this is us and this has them it's not an us from them they're corporations and the ... that's how they listed myself again I think to vote in this country\nYou should have to pass a fifty question test and at least get a Seventy five\nSo you know how to vote while you're voting where you're voting what parties\nIn this country you should have to pass a fifty question test and at least get a Seventy five so you know how to vote why you're voting where you're voting what parties coming\nUh as far as the civil war in this country at a friend of mine told me when I Lived in South Carolina once when I mentioned the civil war and he said it wasn't the civil war it was a war of northern aggression because there was nothing civil about it well we are in the ... civil war right now and with regards to this next election I Can't see\nIt not getting more ugly than it was I personally predict there's going to be a red wave\nCome a long time in Congress and that's because of the Kavanaugh hearings themselves\nA and you know I'm I'm just not to question it's it's a it's a screw in question but if somebody turned around tomorrow and said I mean the\nBottom of the bus drivers are taking the bathroom break cat at a fast food restaurant and he says Mr Schumer Mr or or ... or or or Mr selling so expose themselves to be in the bathroom do they get a hearing from that do they not get a hearing\nI mean isn't that ridiculous I understand what happened with the cabinet room\nBut ah this country's out of control and it doesn't straight now are there could be a civil war where the national guard protect our borders and if nothing else anyone living at listening out there should understand that you know there are countries out there that are that are against us that don't like us\nAnd they want to sit down and they want us down in the dirt and this has gone back fifty years and a hundred years we leave our guard down and we start tearing ourselves apart internally\nSomeone's going to make a move on us trend I appreciate you taking my culture\nAbsolutely no you know you're pretty articulate about it the only I don't agree with you for sure is a I don't I don't want to give a test to see because just because you can answer questions I guess your test would include questions about government and so on\nBecause I've seen very bright people who don't have wisdom just because I have a master's round the doctor but I Know people doctors at just because they have a degree\nDoesn't make them very wise\nSo I don't think I Want to test for voting I Do want to make sure we had a caller about the integrity of the voting system that isn't real big trouble but I certainly don't want to test for voting but I I I Do I certainly\nWon't don't want to make it easier like you can ... a motor voting rights you can or voting the day of the election\nThings that you know or or voting even three months before things happen right that was a problem in Florida I think you know where where people had voted and they didn't get to see what happened the next few weeks I Want to be a reason for it I don't want to go out of my way to make a difficult\nBut there are people who die ... I remember in El Salvador\nThey saw it online and they were bullets\nBeing shot at them obviously and bloody some of them to vote and they held up I don't know ... I Can't even think what color was the\nHell it whenever they were using to signify that they voted we we don't take that seriously enough so I don't want to make it easy for the people here he sounds like I'm contradict myself to make it easier the people on a reform to vote\nSame token you cannot voting and of course a test of course that was has a bad history in terms of the south\nTerms of trying to keep the blacks from voting and others so that that's not my idea or not you know but I certainly don't want to make it so easy that they go through the DMV and vote well go to the DMV the department of eagles that's\nThat's a chore too so hey I've got a story later weekly here at the Generation Z I'm giving away they're not voting because they this is great they got their ballots I guess maybe through the Internet or whatever\nBut they don't know where to get postage them so that's that's a true story they don't have a postage stamps\nAnd I bet you there on the other side so maybe there was something to the other caller was talking about let's go to John in Denver, Colorado John you're on with mark\n[noise] Kmart [noise] ah I don't agree that the American civil war the vast majority of Americans today or civil standing people were very bright minds and\nThey're raising Trump got elected to the American public are disappointed I mean a a legislator a\nHome what got elected because he was an outsider empty because he's a businessman [noise] and and the\nMoney that his business is very a poodle and he knows when he's in a bad deal\nAnd he [noise] I think to a

local shows in Los Angeles including on Westwood one's affiliate in Los Angeles seven Ninety KBC boy that sounds familiar saying that in fact I got so used to saying that\nThat I went to another station another network showed the engineers that media markets or ... or you know a practice run here and we did and I said the wrong for over flu station but I guess that's what happens when you're so used to it but we know the number here let's do it correctly eight six six Ninety red eye\nOf the same thing as eight six six nine o seven\nThirty three thirty nine and we'll be taking your calls in a little bit but first I Want to tell you that well we've been doing the last couple of hours\nWe've been trying to talk about the civil war between the left\nAnd the right and that's what I think has been occurring here for the last couple of years that I think it's the second civil war\nAnd you've been reacting to that on line I mean a through your calls\nBut first of all let's get it straight if you don't already know what the left liberals Democrats whatever you want to call them will do anything and everything to when they have no limits and they have no guard rails as to what is acceptable\nThis isn't even the era of Ronald Reagan where he can be friends with ... speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night and President Reagan will ask what has happened with all the vitriol during the day\nReagan where he can be friends with ... speaker Tip O'Neill I mentioned this last hour and have a drink with him at night\nAnd President Reagan when I ask what had happened with all the vitriol during the day and Tip O'Neill way was the speaker of houses of the time he said that's the day time does that night we're way past that and you saw Senator Graham talking about that that these were his friends\nThat he he was saying all those things about because of what they've done their search for power\n[noise] and oh yeah\nProbably now you can't even have a drink a night because look what it may have done to judge Kevin [noise]\nIt has become an all out war anything as I said and everything goes now lying as commonplace as with her image of this with Harry Reid claiming Romney didn't pay any taxes someone as friends or someone told them that wasn't true and then he was a cold on that he said well\nIt would work didn't it was a total insanity of the charge that Kavanaugh was part of the group allowing for women to be gang raped so much so that even the New York times didn't print that accusation\nBy the way she her own has suggested Kevin did not deserve did you catch this he did not deserve due process because of his outcomes driven concern of legal philosophy that is very clear again if you're on the right\nYou don't want to serve the process of being a the a proven guilty just the accusation is not\nSo she may not have been politically motivated afford but you used her you and your masters in deception used her\nThis is all just crazy and I I Love with Graham said he's going to get to the bottom of its suggesting that someone and then find science officer one affords attorneys may have been responsible for strategically delaying the leak deploying the leak the harm Kavanaugh's chances\nAre it's just amazing as he said those actually Senator Hatch so this the goalpost moving never stops\nAnd here's my summation and then we'll take your calls the only force is the way you and your cronies conducted the circus\nAnd maybe the ... to cross the ACLU the American civil liberties union yeah right they chimed in because they too are left to screw up before they our civil liberties group and so they came out against the nomination and I quote\nThe sale use board of directors deeply concerned by the allegations raised in recent weeks has made a rare exception to his longstanding policy and voted to oppose the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh they passed a resolution stating they oppose the confirmation of judge Kevin of the Supreme Court there aren't credible allegations\nViscerally ACLU allegations that judge Kevin I was engaged in serious misconduct you mean like Bill Clinton did you say anything then sort of not fanatical investigated by the Senate what would it be advocates adequate seven FBI checks eight nine what does it Dr Ford's credible testimony subsequent allegations of sexual misconduct\nYou mean the great thing that even the times wouldn't publish the adequate investigation maybe they can investigate better and judge Kavanaugh's testament to the leaders of the doubt about it is a fitness to serve as an associate justice of the Supreme Court\nThis is not a decision take lightly we cannot remain silent on these extraordinary circumstances about a lifetime appointment to the hardest core to the land I'm trying to shorten it the standards for such an appointment on the burden is on the nominee the burden on the nominee to prove that something happened how exactly does one do that\nThe burden is not met as long as they're unresolved questions regarding the credible allegations of sexual assaults assault get it on resolved allegations so if they can never resolve it which they can't because there is no cooperation then voila you've never be confirmed\nAnd it goes on and on I I don't want to make your two depressed but there does again based on allegations I Want to know I just want to know where in the past the ACLU wanted someone convicted because of allegations\nBut this is what the Democrats and the left have no soul and there was no place to go with all of this except down on the other and the loss of a piece of America [noise]\nTell me what you think of all of this application of the assumption of innocence and self

that Governor Jerry Brown as press secretary back in the seventies and Governor Brown is the governor of California now\nAnd I just look at California and it's like wow this place is just it's just it's just crazy and the Democratic party is just so evil and visceral you know the Republicans do have a few of those but for the most part they're pretty down to earth diesel people and I think Trump\nIs the best thing it's happening to us politics and all I have a bunch of liberal friends on the actual ... what did you vote for a spot I voted libertarian that way and get all of that

that he had a problem but there is a program to make sure that people can live their lives and not let you know something here or something there get in a way of them being successful\nHe had nothing even this I suggested it who knows what really happened even if he was a part of it in some way these high school kids as you were talking about these were minors and what about us thirty some odd years where he is his bank account of all the stuff he did well\nIt wasn't about that if you just look as you said about the spirit of the law of the literature law\nHe really wasn't guilty of anything but it didn't matter what the Democrats were up to they were just trying to stall has to make sure he didn't get on the Supreme Court they have this feeling that maybe if they won the Senate which are not going to do or you know they could make some difference in who the nominee was and I don't think that's going to happen\nSo they were asked to destroy it didn't matter who ...\nPresident

theory you know we would have got these kids\nNashville Iran with mark [noise] hey\nI'm I uh I've got a little theory you know we we've got these kids and you know there are what ten twelve Fifteen Years old before they're released\nI'll either go ahead and you hear me now I can go ahead\nOkay um so I was saying you know kids to you when they start getting to the age of of even slightly paying attention to what's going on in the world they're twelve Fifteen Years old so these kids started paying attention and for the next eight years\nAs someone that would have been spoon fed all this Obama stuff you know no winners and losers and filled day now these kids are twenty twenty five thirty years old and all they know it was Obama so now I've got a twenty two year old daughter and a twenty year old daughter and they are both\nHate Donald Trump one of them refused to sit down and talk with me at all the other one I got to sit down and and talk with her and I\nShowed her some facts kind of changed or a little bit and then and then I've got my ten year old that loves straw and he goes to school and all the kids in his class\nThey dared Trump supporter so this generation that's coming that wasn't raised up in a bomber um years\nI completed my ten year old knows more about politics than my twenty and twenty two year old daughter too you know and and I think that uh these kids when they grew up you know and basically\nAnd the Obama years so we've got this generation that we've got another generation that's coming up that uh is gonna be hopefully the generation that saves us you know so I just wanted to to\nYou know kind of let you know about that or you know it's a generation gap that I see with my own kids\nFrom you you got to get rid of your two older ones just tell me about it you know and and that's been you know the other\nThing about Kavanaugh and and you've got this a huge silent majority\nUm that ... year they're they're\nThey're afraid you talk about fighting and that's what the Democrats and the the liberals are doing the auditing I'm In the silent majority is you know they're afraid to say anything like that guy you know earlier said that\nHe voted libertarian you know instead of just coming out and saying hey I voted for Trump you know as a bear scare and you've got a small group of people\nWho are ... are in the majority and I think this product\nAnd uh all the spin on it is really going to show at the polls were the we've got a huge silent majority I'm you know so well\nI think they ... yeah yeah no I I think you're right now are you guys move me a little bit you know I came on pessimistic about losing the house I don't know just listening to an end by the way you try you also made a very good point which is and I said this before\nWho the president makes a difference who the people young people grow up with that is what they hear and that's what they learn right that's why during the Obama administration to get a lot of young people all they hear is that side and now with Trump although we have the media against us which are it's a lot\nBut if they see the economy's doing well and their lives or improve the lives of their parents that starts to influence them and more people like that was in his own microcosm in his family the ten year old is a Trump supporter and the ones who grew up with the Obama and he can't even talk to them\nI Know that feeling [laughter] I Know my own house so I Can't be hard on him let's go to a ... in Fresno, California Iran was mark [noise]\n[noise] yeah I think\nAre original argument was whether there was had to have a war going on [noise]\nYeah no um [noise] it is going on and it's a Cold War [noise]\nWhat's what's that sounds that on your end I think we're hearing something on your end\nBut to\nGo ahead ...
