this all related to because\nThe ... because of the reaction\nOf the uh the the Pfizer application and the other memos that than the Trump Administration sent to the inspector general which she only reason that you would send something to the inspector general\nAnd not released into the public is because you wish the inspector general or without the interference of the media to do an investigation on corruption inside the department of justice based on the ... application just throwing that out ...\nYou know it's an interesting um it's an interesting time because you I I went back\nAnd I saw a couple of things you mentioned about Mueller mentioned about you know Russian pro ... over the last few days but they weren't the stories that we have been saying\nYou know going back to the um it was the day of the Papadopoulos indictment and the New York times when the president tweeted no collusion and then the\nNew York times wrote the story he was tweeting that as they were proving there was collusion\nWith an indictment by the way proving the indictment had nothing to do with the collusion nothing\nAnd so that narrative became again they were writing it as if it were fact and I mean like a legal fact documented\nYou want legal facts go to Sarah a quarterback Tom or go to you know uh when they were back or is there a quarter and and Solomon when they were you know back in ... news ah and they were releasing documents from the court\nThose are legal facts but lately this ... ... ... it's it's really the the chatter surrounding the whole\nRussian collusion thing has all but died just enough singers nothing on it as hand but yesterday and and the interesting thing is that seem to happen about the same time that the White House sent all that information\nTo the inspector general everything has gone quiet as if it never existed because I ... I wouldn't have predicted that move where he would just handed over to the I G\nI wouldn't have thought of it I guess yeah but\nThere were some is direction there because we were talking about the fact that our allies don't want us to relieve some of our allies for were given to the inspector general\nBut I guess yeah but well there were some is direction there because we were talking about the fact that our allies don't want us to relieve some of our allies writer for we're giving to the inspector general that didn't make any sense to us for cobra electronics here's your forecast\nWe'll see

the power of what what differentiated Jim Brown was\nHe just had the power go back and watch some of the old films of Jim Brown I mean walking over\n... over linebackers bigger than him and and just having incredibly ... power but he had great balance didn't have the speed I don't believe or the acceleration of an OJ or berries Sanders and but he had the power nobody I don't think anybody ever came close to the power that he had bought\nThat being said Jim rounds old Jim Brown is not a part of popular culture today\nA you ask the average or a a thirty year old if they know who Jim Brown is bearing on what you're talking about that though the the the old guy that you know they might remember the fact that\nYou know he has worked with gangs before ... uh you know Jim Brown comes into\nThe substance issue huge for anybody who is paid attention over the last Thirty years as to what he's been involved with a Jim Brown is not part of popular culture today with the youth and millennials like Kanye West is the left is scared to death of Kanye West because he's smack in the middle\nOf the the culture that is expected by the elite liberals to be a liberal supporter mhm\nHe cannot have a different opinion and if he does have a different opinion than Trump is exploiting the mental issues the Kanye West had nobody was talking about mental issues of ... when he when you know he was up the award show where they\nKnow on the left no no no uh nobody in a lump was talking about his ah you know his mental state when he said that uh George Bush a hates all black people because of the country and I didn't\nWrite that that that that's not a because it again that's not a threat it's something at that time politically they could use a not so much the Taylor Swift award show moment but the the ah George Bush comment\nAnd it was notable to the left but they didn't they didn't label him as insane\nHey if you think about his demeanor because I I don't know by the way I don't know what a a a ... what do you call it the the hero voyage or what whatever Trump\nIs on right now I'm [laughter] I'm I'm not sure what I mean [laughter] ah I I really don't know ah ah well I think\nYou can you sometimes you can go through a lot of Cairo journey is what he said yeah you're you're there you go through a ... a lot of Kanye West lurks oh okay I understand this for not understand the sudden said All right up there and I do I have no idea what this means get back kind of get back\nTo you know I mean look look to the Beatles for inspiration she loves you yeah yeah yeah she loves you yeah yeah\nYeah well no I disagree with you if you're looking for\nComplete and total accuracy in a song tax man mhm yeah oh sure also from the Beatles yes yes I mean that's accuracy is death I mean that that was come you understood that exactly wasn't one for me\nWas that when they had the Ninety percent tax rate was nine for you in one for me I was on yeah which was actually the tax rate at the time you know and I\nThink the but\nIf you look at his demeanor in the way ... is actually talked I think he was on chemical things where he said a couple of things\nAnd listening to them is like I was like if you don't look at the video you're like is that Congress talking because his demeanor was calm and straight to the point\nIt wasn't the Taylor Swift moment it wasn't that it wasn't the moment after Katrina the George Bush comment it wasn't that\nIt was something that the content of the comment\nReally couldn't be debated by the left so what do they do\nThey go to the labeling and the name calling and then you know all of a sudden will now he's crazy which means he's not capable of making a thought at all you know this goes beyond the Mia Love thing\nOr you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment ah from\nIt goes beyond the media love thing\nOr you know and and the comments were all over the place you know the the token comment a from a Thursday or you know to the\nInsane comment but the insane comment is well he's not capable he doesn't have the facts why you to do that why is the mini ...\nWhy is anybody surprise that a a black man in rap ...\nThat's been in rap now for a couple of decades mhm looks overall and remember you know you're a lot of rappers view themselves as a lot of old rockers did as revolutionaries some and you look what are you looking for you're looking for where you believe\nManipulation may be happening well if you want to look at manipulation if you want to look at bigotry if you want to look at intolerance if you want to look at an elite a stab which meant that is telling all blacks you must think light\nOr something is wrong with you I'm not surprised more\nMale rap stars haven't come out and said well this is ridiculous mhm\nAs Tanya is doing\nI think it's completely and totally normal that you'd look can you say wait a minute the Democrat Party has been manipulate look we get calls\nFrom blacks all the time that said I finally woke up and realize that ... now it's not the majority but it's growing mhm\nAnd obviously when that message is put out to any demographic that exist out there that you must act this way you must think this way there's only one way to think and if you don't think this way you are betraying your race\nSomebody's finally going to stand up and saying you're full of it right that is just naturally going to happen and that's essentially the point they've ... made on chemical\nYou know this this is ridiculous that someone can't think independently but they've got they've got to be a part of groupthink\nI mean imagine Trump\nHad said that\nThey will be done\nThat not that all blacks think alike but they should think alike politically\nIt would be over CNN would have a twenty four hour special report on it\nAnd and that's that's the thing they and and for ... it is you know it's the point ... who he's always been getting attention you know because\nThat's what he likes by the way I made a mistake of just you know mentioned a few uh you know running backs out there who I thought was great because wherever you leave out somebody's gonna and the list was about include was not inclusive\nWould you leave at Walter Payton you know Eric Eric Dickerson people you know I'm going to bring a\nA of a a that up and it's Smith\nYeah yeah yeah right no\nThurman Thomas I have to bring that up because being a bills fan [laughter] I mean there's like so we're getting that we're not going to go to calls deciding who is the best running back of all time they'll list was not\nIn close\nFor anybody I Would have been the best quarterback of all time if it weren't for Shawn Michaels [laughter]\n\nWent to grade school

Welcome to the show\nUm I I really interested in what you're talking about and\nAbout the stock market going down there the number of races like you said\nA including perhaps a ... a political agenda with respect to some businesses but the thing about it's about our country being able to produce everything that it needs right here in this country and the good thing about that\nWhich is why NAFTA was so bad the good thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo its horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever\nGood thing about doing it here if we create more jobs\nNo its horror Mary it's horrible the last thing you would ever the last thing you would ever want to do is make a law that everything must be produced here\nBecause then prices would skyrocket through the roof you would have monopolies\nThat would make the goods and services that you get prices would be much higher than they should be doing it and retail doors shutting wrapped and write a if the opposite ... you would go in a massive recession if\nWe had a policy that we produce everything in this country\nPrices of goods and services would skyrocket through the roof\nBecause it makes it more profitable for American producer yes and and were eventually going to get to that point I Believe I well\nIt depends on who's in Washington but I Believe we will get to the point of self sufficiency where you know we can produce for the United states and export at the same time which is a which will be a great point\nA to a to get to we're not there yet but as we\n... really one of the most underreported stories of the entire year ... is that the United states\nIs now on an happened about three weeks ago became the number one\nProducer of oil in the world mhm yeah [noise] um and and this is it I mean you if you put in place all the things of that that will make an economy great again [laughter] um and they did\nBy the way I think that's the number one reason or ... supporting a or the or the president his tax bill went way way down\n[laughter] but um the you know the [laughter] that'd be enough for me [laughter] it's not the case for me though mine went up a but but the thing to do that right\nSo the but the but you put in place all of those dynamics for great economy and all it's working up until what the two three numbers we talked about the GDP numbers from the second quarter and said hey this is great\nBut what is the third quarter fourth quarter and then first quarter of next year look like if the cost of raw materials is still high and increasing still going up that is a negative that is strictly\nControlled by the government that is something that his policies put in place that doesn't need to be there\nThough have you don't win and we said we stayed with China and the intellectual property yeah we understand we understand the case there we didn't understand Canada Mexico or Europe or even\nA for the most part are not that you could have done a few things different in in TPP but remember\nThe great victories of the dairy with Canada was already ... cannot had already agreed to that yeah I'm a you know ... before so that was a lot of disagreed victory uh but that was something we already had before and decided not you know the Trump Administration decided\nYou know not to uh to take that you and I went through and and and uh as you know Wall Street journal and others didn't look actually at the the new NAFTA and then there's not much change from the old\nNAFTA the biggest victory that the president has claimed\nThat he claimed was the fact that the terrorists worked\nTo get what he wanted with the automobile industry right all all he did in the automobile industry was increased the cost of producing an automobile in Mexico in the United states and in Canada yeah\nNobody is debating that that's not what happened right and that's viewed as a victory well if I remember two of the president's major goals his goals his state of goals was to reduce the one hundred and fifty billion dollar trade deficit\nI don't see how this does it because the majority of the new NAFTA does is the exact same as the old NAFTA ... except for automobiles the dairy which would have been in TPP anyway only increases the U.S market to Canada by one percent ...\nAh and\nAh the rest is still the same right so you ask okay what were the what were the because that the president tried to make the terrorists were worth it because we got we wanted in automobiles so what did you get\nYou increase the cost of automobiles for people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries\nFor people in the United states to produce them in the United states in Canada and Mexico raising the cost of an automobile for all three countries and because production costs went up you are less likely to be able to sell those goods\nTo you know it produces them in the United states and sell them elsewhere exactly the opposite of the two things that you wanted a reduction in the trade deficit and to produce things in the United states to sell them elsewhere\nWell and and the right now we are I mean if you look at at at oil that's one great example of because of the technology created a in recent years and and how much more efficient they are as an industry\nAre now you you talk about you know the farmers I mean you if you\nIf you say it's a very populous viewpoint right we need to help the farmer but when you think of the role that they play and and the and the global market in terms of food\nUh you know set of before a few minutes ago but they feed the world that food goes all over the world um\nYou know and and they're telling the administration look your your your money that\nYou gave us a thanks but no thanks we need the business that's what we need and and that's the ... because\nForget about the political pots president doesn't need them\nHe doesn't need to uh I Know everybody does it politically but this president doesn't need that\nAnd they're telling him basically it's ... it's doing the opposite\nRight because it it is you know it's just protectionist policy which brings about retaliation from our trade partners and then all of a sudden the farmers are hurting and it's not just ethanol farmers [laughter] it's\nI mean they get their government bailout with the ten percent mandate\nSo I have to believe inside the White House right now they're probably\nScrambling ... of of getting things done as you said it was like it wasn't just a coincidence that the president announced yesterday that China and and that's the other thing too I mean for the president has a you know the uh\nThe supportive of a lot of people and other and I know people who are otherwise conservative and say you know they supported the president they say well well this is all negotiation\nBut wait he was a master negotiator why does he need to threat threatened and ultimately cost people a lot of money and hurt industry in order to get them to go ... done he's a master negotiator if he doesn't need to do that well\nAs I said you know ... and again ... ... we can go through any political rhetoric are out there but where was the win in NAFTA\nRight well\nAnd that's it except for the you know ... and you can look as we said you can look at it the one percent increase in the market share for the United states in the Canadian dairy mhm but then\nThey really won the you know they they the the whole timber thing which will be which will help America actually but the president did allow what what we\nExcept for the dairy that now which increases the market size you know the our our market potential of a one percent of the Canadian business which isn't a lot of dollars right overall was at worst the loss of business with the terrorists that the president\nHas put on that does raise the cost of goods and services\nAnd affected the cost of raw materials\nAnd other goods and services for American businesses\nAre businesses to actually produce it to get a one percent share more of the dairy market of Canada which is miniscule by because now but now he mentioned that but his big victory this is what the president said we're not is this isn't our opinion\nWas\nThe automobile thing I got what I wanted an automobiles what did you get\nWhat we made and so some ah some employers of in Mexico have to pay sixteen dollars an hour\n... some have to do that won't\nFind you've just made them say okay we're going to go to automation quicker right\nOr and even with the was it uh I think it was a Wall Street journal said most and I forgot who else said well it's only a two point five percent tariff so really isn't going to affect that isn't that great\nSo we're just we're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business\nWe're still going to sell it and try to you know and and we're still not going to produce anything in the United states we're we're not we're not transferring any business to the United states because of that but the other than the president want to do is make sure that\nWe could in the United states sell our vehicles overseas but that's less likely to happen because the cost in the United states in Canada and in Mexico went up ... as to his caps on what what Mexico you know could send us in cars before other tariffs hit\nWell we haven't ... they haven't reached that cap and car buying in the United states has stagnated so they looked at that for both Canada and Mexico and said it's sort of like what they did in South Korea\nWhere they said okay you can only do we now doubled the amount of cars uh with the safety precautions to twenty thousand that we can sell in South Korea instead of ten thousand so see we doubled the market for the United states and the United states was only selling six thousand to begin with\nWould you prefer to read wrote getting on your smartphone will scroll down version is also available at Rhodes ... dot com simply click

C. P. average if they're going by polls and there are so very there there are\nA lot fewer poles when you talk about a lot of the congressional races out there\nWell ... ... and\n[noise] I guess historically tend to shift happened\nAh with ... if you look at the margin of error on the on the polls that were done\nOn the recent polls that were done in that race ah the the uh you know test her up by by four and a grab us a margin of error is three point seven\nSo that you know that right there could be neck and neck are they calling a toss up because of the fact that you know it's still too close to the margin of error what we ought to consider is not a toss up that's my point\nMy point is that it's our cp has it as definitely blue [noise]\nThat's my point\nMy point is that it's our cp has it as definitely blue\nOn my map but still showing great it's just when gray\n[laughter] just sit there and get it when it just Web grey eye of thanks to the staff at our cp for ... was it that way of what happened that just when it just went gray yeah All right I'm I'm I Apologize yeah I don't know if it updated it and what I had was from a week ago or something\nBut it's just one great ... tiny brain asked myself like I Do wonder am I looking at the right Montana well and the look but then when you're paws on my way and all of a sudden it updates Edwards gray in front of made a\nBecause Aaron Arizona was in grade before\nArizona was like blue was flashes or what men slightly favoring blues and I was going to ask that banks because it makes Sally and all of a sudden boom that appears in that comes up is great\nAnd that because ... there's been a huge swing there okay in recent polls are going from\nAll right I'm a ... or ... ... ... and and now she's plus six that's a huge swing\nDifferent pollster but it is a it's a it's a pretty big swing so\nUm and it is a it's a different uh the pollster in fact I'm well\nOkay I Know what I was looking at I had the one that said there's the R.

S. P. S. thing if prices get too expensive and it's costing you know the uh the company to raise prices on Amazon\nThey do want him to things get rid of that agreement and go and move away from it or they pass it along to the consumer\n... plain and simple\nOr this news item the co founder of the opposition research from behind the Steele dossier Ga for those of you that are brand new listeners\nWill do it very quickly because we we can do it very quickly an update you so you understand completely what we're talking about\nUh the Democrats accused the Trump or the campaign of colluding with the Russians to hack and or change the outcome of the election but the evidence we have found out is it's just the opposite the DNC and the Hillary campaign\nPaid a law firm\nPerkins ... who paid and opposition research from a a fusion GPS who paid the former British spy Christopher Steele who got a information he says from the Russians close to the Kremlin in order\nTo change the outcome of the election by getting unverified salacious allegations against Donald Trump that they were going to use to\nKill his campaign and when they couldn't do that they wanted to use in order to destroy the legitimacy of the twenty sixteen election they also use that information\nAs a basis to get a secret warned against the Trump campaign while the campaign was actually going so you know you see fusion GPS was a part of it well\nThe cofounder of the opposition research from\nGlen Simpson will invoke his first and Fifth Amendment privileges to avoid testifying before Congress next week his lawyer has told Congress\nAccording to the hill Simpsons attorney told house a judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte the Simpson will not appear for a deposition because the congressional investigation is not designed to discover the truth\n[noise] really know\nThe average Virginia Republican subpoenaed Simpson on September twenty nine\nOr after the lawyers said his client would not appear voluntarily for an interview before members of the house judiciary and the house oversight and Government Reform committees\nSimpsons burned a fusion GPS was hired during the twenty sixteen presidential campaign bottle law firm that represented the DNC and the Clinton campaign\n... fusion GPS hired former British spy Christopher Steele\nTo conduct an investigation into Donald Trump's possible links to Russia the result of the probe was eight thirty five page report alleging collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin Republican lawmakers are interested in the ...\nLargely because the FBI reportedly relied on the unverified documents to obtain surveillance warrants against former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page so of course a lawyer is going to say you're not trying to get to the truth\nWell then what does the ... say they're trying to find here's I either get are they going to ask are they going to ask him about his personal taxes I don't think so right are are they going to ask him about a a\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and then ...\nIt'll taxes I don't think that's all right are are they going to ask him about a a\nWho he believes is the best running back ever and the national football league if you're listening earlier to the show you understand why I brought that up\nOr I don't think so what are they going to ask him up on me I was ... they're going to ask him about\nKanye West [laughter] probably not they're probably going to ask him about fusion GPS and their\nRole or\nIn the uh entire flow chart of the Democrats and the Hillary campaign colluding with the Russians to change the outcome of the election\nSo here's my question thinking a of a fusion GPS Bruce or his wife was employed at fusion GPS yes\nThe\nInspector general's office of the department of justice where Bruce or was employed as the\nAnd an associate deputy attorney general\nAh\nThe inspector general would have then access to any communications if they're still there between Bruce or and his wife if there were any to begin with and if they're still they're inspector general gets them for the asking\nA does he oh he ... he yes from the department of justice yeah well yes have because because they were done internally yesterday right on right on an official yes device from the department and I and again\nIf the those are ... that that's a number of hits right away from the point being is that you look at all the in this case basically it's a it's a block because fusion GPS doesn't wanna cough up the truth they have no interest in doing that\nBut\nHow so how how would you find it otherwise well part I Would think part of that would be looking into Bruce or his involvement with a you know a\nProfessionally possibly with his wife and if there were any communications I think the number one thing you would do the first thing you you would do as you would look to see if there were any communications during that time and if they were on a those devices
