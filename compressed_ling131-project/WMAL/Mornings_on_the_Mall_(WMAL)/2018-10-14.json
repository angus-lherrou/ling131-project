A. chartered a a a task force of national\nExperts in domestic violence an intimate partner violence\nAnd um what they came up with was a fourteen recommendation planned for VHS to implement\nAn intimate partner violence assistance program and so from that\nThat was the inception of the intimate partner violence assistance program based on those recommendations so in January two thousand fourteen\nThey began a rapid implementation program with six the a medical centers around the country from that time from two thousand fourteen 'til now well actually until April two thousand Eighteen\nThe systems program has grown to one hundred sites and we're actually approaching a hundred and forty five since Congress funded the program in April of two thousand Eighteen\nSo exciting thing intimate partner violence can bring on many factors can you speak to us about the effects of intimate partner violence as it relates to family and life\nStress isolation anger possibly leading to alcoholism or use of substances can you talk to us about that short let me start\nWith some numbers so it gives you an idea of really where we are with intimate partner violence let me preface it by saying that it is not an easy situation to admit to so those who are admitting to it as very courageous for them to do that\nBut it's hard to really get fool and accurate numbers of level of intimate partner violence so the general population the rate of women experiencing intimate partner violence is basically one out of three women\nFor men in the general population this one out of four four women veterans twice as much okay so if you have the same three women if their veterans is two out of three veteran limit reporting experience of intimate partner violence [laughter]\nFor a veteran then it's two out of four so half again that increases twice as much as general population\nWe know that women admit to intimate partner violence more so than men but moving on it impacts everything all aspects of living whether it's medical with his physical emotional social economic\nI'm spiritual just to name some of the health conditions that can worsen we're talking about either increase an appetite decreasing appetite if it's an increase in\nThe ... if it's an increase an appetite you're talking about on any associated health concerns with being overweight\nArthritis chronic pain increases asthma can increase\nGastrointestinal problems like irritable bowel syndrome can increase\nThe risk for a TV I which is a traumatic brain injury hypertension can occur cardiovascular issues socially you talking about social isolation which is what you already pointed out trust issues and relationships women and men who are experiencing I PV intimate partner violence\nHave um issues with maintaining employment which can lead to poverty lead to homelessness in terms of psychological issues you're talking about an increase in suicidal risk homicidal risk increase in depressive symptoms\nAnxiety stress PATS these symptoms ability just a function addiction goes up the rates of substance abuse and misuse increases spiritually they can be a moral distressed that a person experiences as well so all aspects of life\nJust in case there's a veteran or family member or caregiver community member listening is there an opportunity for someone listening to speak with someone today is there a hotline is there a website that you can offer\nThat so literally there are three resources I like to pass on to you today and they're eight hundred numbers and all of them are easily accessible because they are eight hundred numbers the first number would be the national domestic violence hotline and that's one eight hundred seven nine nine safe\nAnd that is seven to three three so one eight hundred seven nine nine seven two three three is available twenty four hours a day seven days a week or they can go to the hotline dot org\nThere's also um the veterans crisis line and that's one eight hundred two seven three eight to five five or they can go online and just put in a veterans crisis line dot net and they can chat with someone\nIn addition to that if you have a family member who is a veteran who's ... you're concerned about might be experiencing intimate partner violence whether using it or experiencing it I'm a family members can call coaching into care\nAnd that's for family members who like to get their their veterans family members into mental health care\nAnd that phone number is eight eight eight\nEight two three seven four five eight again eight eight eight eight two three seven four or five eight and there are coaches who are license I'm a psychologist and social workers who are there to help coach the family and the veterans and get into mental health assistance in care\nThank you so much for the a resource ah there because I Know we're discussing this and sometimes when people are listening there that opportunity right there and I didn't want anyone to miss it um sometimes can feel safe and confident about reporting intimate partner balance to the provider\nAre they a precautionary methods that keep other employees and their spouses from accessing the medical information that's\nAn excellent point so you know one of the most important pieces of the intimate partner violence to safety we want to decrease we want to decrease the risk and so when providers ask\nAbout an intimate partner violence as an opportunity to have the heart to heart conversation and a boy common mistakes for that provided may have which is leaving your partner immediately that's a mistake [laughter]\nWe want to make sure that a person has a safety plan\nAnd most importantly that the veteran has gives the provider permission to write and document and they are electronic record\nAny ... any type of information shared around intimate partner violence because we know risk increases with access to medical records by the person who is using violence so we want to decrease at risk\nSo you have to get permission [noise] um and uh you talk to that person in detail what will be shared\nAnd I'm making sure that that person access as the intimate partner violence coordinator\nImmediately so I'm after they do do a screening they couldn't get permission about how they can document what they can document\nAnd providers are trained on what to do if they if they need to use an alternate route for documentation and not in their um electronic records so we want to cover all bases to mitigate any kind of risk\nOf the ending Pamela this has been great information thank you so much for sharing um and I just want to give once again the domestic violence hotlines for those who may be experiencing intimate partner violence it's one eight hundred seven nine nine safe\nAgain that's one eight hundred seven nine nine safe or log onto hot line dot org hotline dot org\nToday's discussion has given helpful information about the intimate

G. M. P. certified lab which means current good manufacturing practices and this isn't the mandate is set of rules that we follow as a matter of fact just recently the FDA came in and did an infection and they said hey guys keep up with it would work\nNow you mentioned earlier that there's a strong connection between vitamin D and diabetes talk a little bit about how your fast melt the three formula could help folks that are dealing with diabetes or even at risk of getting diabetes\nWell yeah it is a huge problem and in type two diabetic what we find is that there's plenty of insulin in the body but the insulin is not recognized by the south and so what vitamin D three does is it takes that problem and it seems to fix it and now\nThey've studied vitamin D three and prove this insulin sure like sixty percent\nAnd compare it to the most popular diabetic drugs improve the Thirteen percent wow\nNow let me ask you this doctor bank is how can you fast smelled these free formula help boost your immune system\nVitamin D is responsible for two hundred different chemicals that your immune cells produce to fight off bacteria and viruses here come on that's receptive to having any type of called ...

maybe it comes to thirtieth going\nWow and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that have been taking your formula and what kind of results of basing\nLet me tell you my own story so over the summer I didn't take as much you might be actually traveling and I ran out of it do\nWhat happened to me it was you know basically pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand\nI don't know what is this is weird but then I realized that I had run on the street formula and I went off of it for several weeks and the minute I started going on and it took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away wow crazy isn't it and\nThat's how you know something's working right if you stop and the health issues come back\nWell there's your answer that's the best test that anyone can listen to especially if you're on the fence\nEgo I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do it to the next time you give up the number to have people orders it's go ahead in order it I Know you mentioned that the ... and ... try yourself and say on it for five six weeks and then I don't doubt it then go off of it and see if anything gets worse\nAnd again folks and want to take a moment here to let you listeners know that if you want to try Dr ... vitamin D three formula there's this special toll free number for

eight hundred for one three six seven seven nine I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred for one three six seven seven nine\nSo what do you think folks are you one of the Seventy percent of people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements joining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and occupying is what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying yeah\nYou know what I'm saying it's a multifaceted problem where one\nWe're not getting enough vitamin D three hundred system ... vitamin D trees are responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly it surprised me because of medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bones we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right hand for the first twenty something years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands of the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred and studies\nShow that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's\nIt's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that shouldn't be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy okay\nSo I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women who were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was due to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading study you know I I kind of pies right there and went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck shift\nIn the equator and all over the world and they're getting into her ... young raise them and they're developing skin cancer but then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers an inside and I went home\nIt was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream can you do three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body starting to slow down\nFor it's it's kind of a ... that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially here in bed\nRolling from side to side you wake up with your knees hurt in your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that said this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of the joint pain ball and pain muscle pain\nFor my job I Would say on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your thoughts as quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear and is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market thing that theme good but you're taking a lot of sugar and ... my thing is it's not what you what your body absorb\nWell I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect your energy your sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like feeling a little bit younger Christ\nAnd who wouldn't want that and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that have been taking your formula and what kinds of results that they seen\nI don't want to just sit back and watch the world go by and now that I couldn't either in the world better I just really fall in love and helping people show\nVery accomplished when when I Know that I help somebody we know that you can do something on

five I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred\nEight to seven one to zero five if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress and how your ... formula\nCan help us in the battle against stress\nI'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nUh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nWe're talking about stress and we're talking about stress affects the body and first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could lift many of them is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is making it seem so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that many of them is involved with it it's almost like a hormone well and for example with low levels of magnesium\nYou're going to be very important factor in life you would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have um attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fibromyalgia high blood pressure down the migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's due process and the list goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a lack of magnesium and money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so I think that really mess around with no what happens is that we need the magnesium and your body in order for the count them to be absorbed\nThough so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first phone which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other about there's many more practical applications of this count back formula first of all like I said you drink it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic for people who are under a lot of traffic and the cats sleep well at night\nWorks better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble flip it really because it relaxes you ride any do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the they have to drink a cup of the chemical formula interesting\nNow the other thing that it's really really good for people who aren't paid okay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you\nTell you and and that case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is including arthritic Taipei and fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of area that like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you name seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person had\nA magnesium deficiencies many of them they don't absorb their food as well so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this or that you might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more threats or whatever\nRight that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that start to take the count them out of the bones to start getting bone loss you start getting a lot because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know what you are feeling old yeah and your body's actually starting to manifest\nAt well all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nAnd let me tell you and it is simple problem and being a doctor researcher it how do you get into the system\nThe formula we have the counteract formula is fantastic because you get to the powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop ticket to sort of this powder and mix it in yeah and you drink that's cut down on my ... is really incredible because it actually goes right into your bloodstream\nAre and this was probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call it's\nOne eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five ... ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your blood stream so you can replace those vital nutrients that your body burns up

you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five so\nIf you're feeling

you again\nIt's one eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium in their body\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiencies are not like I'm a water main break into where you have written noticeable thing to say they're little trips little leagues here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect where a person to start to go downhill just a little bit at a time to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\n[laughter] don't you think you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually half the translators and the nerve and when you take this comebacks formula many times they will calm your back pay well I Know I I Know a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back and I always try and everything and I took out the ...\nThing and I took out the formula yet I drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour I Would talk show again not wasn't completely gone but I I drink it over ten day period it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or you didn't even have bypass surgery you should be on the comics formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nWell they arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a candidate to lady was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain in just about every joined your body can be Internet could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week in a fire in the next week\nAnd I swear I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later she was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough she was the one who took a week of the formula counteract formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep for the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer me out to her friends\nThat's amazing and when I use is what the professional athletes [laughter] I'm a doctor for the U.S Olympic team and I had a number of athletes

P. plan that would not normally be money that you would put into the raft strategy right\nMoney that you put in the restaurant a genius outside of those qualified plants although you can take distributions and put them into the raft I mean that's a whole nother\nConversation that may or may not be advisable or however or if you do have an irate four one K. for three D. you're going to want to listen to us especially a a in the second half were going to talk a lot about what we called the agility Seventy five I write this is an amazing account\nThat uh we are really now promoting because you know we always try to ... find out what the best to counter\nRight there's a lot of competition in the industry and so different companies come up with different strategies and they're always trying to wind up each other and and I I got to tell you I I they count that we're seeing now our way better than they were you know Fifteen Years ago when we started that\nWe we've coined if you if you're in Washington DC and you know you think the ten ten I write well ... okay we we really brought that we brought that account to the Washington DC and we've got hundreds and hundreds of people in the DC area that have\nPlugged into the ten ten irate than we brought in this thirty percent ... that was a limited time a a really opportunity okay and there was a special promotion going on by a wonderful company would brought it to DC\nUh we talked about on the airwaves Chris plant talked about it a lot a lot of people interested it's all an incredible account well you know now we're gonna talk about the agility Seventy five because you know as we look out there who said what what's the best thing we can talk about okay and it really depends on your objective right so if\nDr right so if your objective is a accumulation well that may not be the agility so we'd try that may be another account if your account if your objective is\nIncome for you and your spouse well maybe the ... Seventy five or something you want to look at if you're a count a or objective is to play in for a legacy to your children are then you might want to look at this count as well so there's just a lot of\nUh variations that you can plug into and ... that's one of the great things about this industry is it isn't about one size fits all\nIt's really about bird dog in understanding what's out there and then ...\nThat aired out there and the first year in that exam runs\nAnd of course you know ... if you have a negative here and this in the index that you choose gifts why you don't lose any money so you have that Flora zero no matter what you're never going to lose money and the account well how long would that hundred and Seventy five percent and go on for do you think\nWell I Know the answer is actually forever\nAnd tell you about it that way of which is good that you know so yes you're right [laughter] okay yeah it's not like a ... you know it was only five yeah right\nBut it's amazing to be a case so this is going to continue this hundred and Seventy five percent what we call it participation rate\nFor as long as you have the account open which hopefully will be for until the day you die right so you will receive a hundred and Seventy five percent of indexed returns\nYear after year after year after year after year\nAnd now let's just say we start taking income on the account and we start with an income amount and that continues to get and grow\nEach year at a hundred and Seventy five percent of the indexed returns let me give an example okay and I have a illustration here that I prepared perfect sorry so I'm just trying\nTo saying it's like he's going to start at a certain amount of income and that is going to be on the base but then every year that there is an increase in the marketing your allocation cats what your income is going to increase\nRight so you know very simple okay I'm going to just say I'm fifty five years old I Wish I still was\nFifty five years old and I have a hundred thousand dollars so All right and I'm going to roll that hundred thousand dollars into the agility Seventy five Iran might come from my my you know another higher re I have er a a four O. one K. from a previous employer or what ever right\nAnd now I'm going to actually let that money just kinda sit there for about ... ten years so darling Aloul I retire growing compound right and so now you know I'm going to do what it's doing and this is based on historical rate of return okay that it's been doing\nWith the criteria that we just talked about\nAnd now it's sixty five years old okay ten years later\nI'm going to turn on the income okay somebody's account is gone Rhone would you believe\nExcuse me I have a cold so I I'm coughing all that I Apologize but and I'm excited okay so about this so from a hundred thousand now it's worth three hundred eleven thousand dollars write them pretty sweet\nI'm starting come on this account by first year's income okay it's going to be Fifteen thousand eight hundred and Ninety six dollars no wait a minute I'll arrive\nYou just put a hundred thousand dollars in there when you started your incomes over Fifteen thousand dollars which will be Fifteen Percent yeah says yeah credible\nRight so think about that than the withdrawal rate but that's just where it starts okay so every year that the index has a positive return I'm going to get a my income is going to go up in the second year my income goes up to Eighteen thousand three eighty\nAbout that and the four in the end or a fourth year right my income stuff Twenty one thousand two hundred and fifty two\nAnd a six year my incomes twenty four thousand five hundred and Seventy four dollars a year so I've gone in six years\nFrom Fifteen thousand eight hundred Ninety six dollars to now twenty four thousand five hundred and Seventy four dollars and that income continues to grow\nAnd it's going to continue to provide these benefits and its income I cannot outlive ... let me give you a shocker ...

here's your host your welcome to point in your home your number one local real estate resource this week's show will be all about real estate transactions in how we can help you prepare for a sale\nAs well as welcome Helen day goes who's from our genius title one of our preferred title companies Helen ... joined us this morning I I've asked her to share with us some of the pitfalls you should be aware of if you're buying an investment real estate and there was a tenant in the property what should you look out for Helen thanks for joining us\nWell thank you Eric for that kind of introduction and yes I recently had several closings where we're having our buyers purchase investment properties\nAnd most frequently it's actually already and investment property for seller and so that can be a real trap if you don't properly have language in the contract to get the documentation that you need for example here by are absolutely needs to have a copy of the existing we\nNeed to be exactly what the terms are whether that actually complies with local\nRegulations and laws mhm you want to make sure that the security deposit is transferred from the seller tuna buyer because at least is turned over to the ear new buyer they are going to be the ones responsible at final walk through and at least ends to return to security deposit\nThat something that should be done at closing not outside of\nClosing a point that when we're not too when you're buying has been property if you're buying with cash or the temptation not to get a survey done can be great especially if there's existing fences in place [laughter]\nDon't blow it make sure you get a a survey so you know because it could be that you're the current owner build their fence off of the property line on your neighbors' property and if that's found out later when that property is being sold you'll have to move your cost off their property don't get caught with that one\nThat's absolutely true and you're exactly right on a cash deal people are definitely looking to avoid some of the requirements that a lender might have but back to the um tenant the ... the purchases they're going to be investment properties\nOften we hadn't buyers who want to get into the investment market it's their first time buying and they don't realize that they have to have a landlord license um many jurisdictions require landlords to do a lead test in addition to that so there's\nSeveral things that they need to think about research before they actually go into the transaction that she had lots of lots of problems\nActually go into the transaction that she had lots of lots of problems with existing sailors hang now I'm not going to get a security deposit pot it at the settlement table I'll just transferred later or well pro rate the rent later all of that should be done by the settlement attorney at closing\nWelcome back to the point in your homes\nWelcome back to the point in your home show I'm Eric Stewart you're hosting Sunday Morning here at eight o'clock and uh [noise]\nWe've had some hairy things happen in the real estate business but before we jump into the story I'm gonna\nTell you I Want to promote one of our

thousand one hundred and fifty forty six square feet [noise] take a look at six thousand one Warm Springs Dr at Eric Stewart group dot com [noise]\nI remember the day that I got a call from the child is family Eric ... is the son of a guy that I had met on the street or just to you know selling homes in the neighborhood and I'm a mystery shop is I Would always seem out in the front yard keeping his yard looking nice and\nUm one day I got this call and I went over and they're ... walked into the front door of the house and there was Mrs child as who was\nSitting in a rocking chair with her three children standing behind her it was a an unusual ... picture and walk in the living room I the door was open for me and then as I open I kind of walked in and said hello hello and it came in and [noise]\nAnd I felt this awkwardness this awkward silence and in that in that moment I uh I sat down a ... era could encourage me just to have a seat and I sat down and I said you know what's going on and uh they said we we've got to sell the house and I said\nOh I'm so sorry what what happened [noise] well\nMy um my father's a my father's in jail right now and I've we've got to sell the house at this point I said wow okay so [noise] uh you can you tell me a little bit more about what occurred well he came home and he found\nA a fee found my mother with her lover and ah he wrestled and the lover pulled a knife outta my dad and my dad turned it on him and killed him in the basement\n[laughter] now this isn't really studying story and it's very unusual to catch a a story like this and the real estate business in fact in my thirty one years I've had a few really unbelievable\nOccurrences with some of the properties I've been selling but this one presented all kinds of questions that I didn't know the answer to\nFor instance when I walked down in the basement the carpeted been replaced at this point because of the blood from the man who deceased in the basement do I have a responsibility to disclose that someone was killed in the house\nInteresting question do I disclosed that that this has now has a stigma potentially if the buyer were to come and move into the property not know that something that happened there and then the buyer moves in and the the neighbors combined say hey\nWelcome were really glad that you're here now isn't it awful what happened you know you could imagine right so what would what would happen in your mind if you just moved in and didn't know\nThat someone had died in the house that you're purchasing not just died but had been murdered [noise]\nIf you remember about maybe Fifteen to Twenty years ago there were the shine bind murders there was a couple of guys who butchered somebody put them in a bag and put it in a trash can in a house that was on the market turns out was on the market with a guy that I Know and so here again\nThere's a stigma the real estate sign is out there in I'm In the news reports hears a body was found in this house it's on the market and you know a call the age and if you want more questions [laughter] would you would you buy that house I'm curious\nI'd like to get your response on this I'd be interested to get emails and respond what'd you buy a house would it matter to you [noise]\nSince we don't do call ins on the show I got to get an email from you know I'd like to hear your thoughts on I'll come back and bring some my my letter bag\nBills and respond what'd you buy a house would it matter to you since we don't do Collins on the show I got to get an email from you like to hear your thoughts on it I'll come back and bring some my my letter bag back up we'll talk about some of the responses what'd you buy a house where someone's been killed in the house how would that affect your value of the property [noise]\nThat might fiduciary duty as the listing agent for the property for cell selling this property for this family\nIs I'm prohibited from disclosing the circumstances by which someone died in the house because death in real estate has no\nMaterial value\nIt's not a material defect it may be valuable to you but you have to ask the question as a buyer or your age and has to ask a question if you're buying a single family home and you're spending four hundred thousand dollars and putting yourself in debt for Fifteen to Thirty years so you can pay it off [noise]\nI Would suggest that you go knock on the doors around the house that you're thinking about buying envy your neighbors folks are going to be living next to these people for the next Thirty years\nYou have a chance it's not like you have to buy that house without knocking on the doors to see who's living on the left in the right and across the street and behind why not do a little bit of due diligence these days you can do all kinds of research on who lives where\nI find that information out and do your neighbors are going to be a no whether or not you know do you want those people as your neighbors [laughter]\nYou can't change who buys a house you can't affect like in our business he bought a house in the market you sell whoever brings in the money to a seller who agrees inside the contract period and the story\nCivil rights act of Eighteen sixty six\nThe American with Disabilities Act of Nineteen Ninety to civil rights act of of Nineteen sixty eight right so there are many acts that protect all buyers and sellers so that everybody's treated\nThe same that's the way it should be thankfully that is the way that\nI've grown up in real estate and thirty one years of selling homes [noise]\nBut disclosure about death hit is not required\nTermites water penetration of talked about that in the past if you had water has been forty five years when when hurricane Agnes came through and you had water coming one time then we had an eight years ago came in for three days where there is a heavy downpour because the [noise]\nYou know maybe the the down spouse was was was disconnected from the gutter or something whatever it might be you disclose those kinds of things [noise]\nWhen it comes time to sell your home you think I I've got I've got to sell [laughter] I've got some work I Need to do what's going to make me money [noise]\nWe're kind of put a dollar into my home to sell the house and make more money [noise]\nYou know it doesn't really pay to replace your roof unless the roof is actually busted\nThe roof maybe it is natural end of life but that is not a reason to replace it why because you won't get paid more for having a brand new roof as long as the roof is not badly ... I mean seriously copying which is where the shingles cup up and ah they clearly look malfunctioned\nIf your roof lays flat and there's no leak in it you put twenty thousand dollars into a new roof you're only going to get a few thousand dollars benefit for that why not just like the buyers do it don't\nPut your money out there you can give the buyer a home warranty to protect your part of your roof to protect your appliances your first your electrical equipment it only costs five hundred bucks to buy warranty and you can transfer the warranty to cover those issues [noise]\nWondering whether you should do a home inspection on your house before you put it on the market the answer is no don't do it unless you know that there's a defect in which case you might need an engineer don't pay your money funding problems that you'll have to fix only to have the buyers inspector come back through the property find more [laughter]\nBuyers want to feel like they get something for that inspection right do they put five hundred dollars that they want to know they're getting at least five hundred bucks back that's kind of the way it goes [noise] most sailors don't have a perfect home inspection some do but most don't hey\nDon't forget about our sun our series registered today Eric Stewart group dot com it's tomorrow excuse me day after tomorrow Tuesday and Wednesday in Maryland and Virginia collapse of weekend seminars coming up in November and December ... and keep an eye out there as well\nAlways a pleasure to be with you tell in Flint joins me straight ahead on the senior solutions so\nThere and do show pointing you hold on one oh five point nine ... fan and am six thirty L.

American Helen thanks for joining us this morning here welcome my pleasure I always enjoyed being here with you will die right insure\nWith some of your thoughts what's going on what have you been thinking about recently well I had coffee with a fellow professional and the seniors service business and she had just gone through a year of dealing with her parents and getting them moved and so forth\nAnd they were in that eighty nine Ninety plus age range and she really ended up taking a year off of work to manage all of it\nAnd we talked about even being in the profession how difficult this whole process can be especially when you get to um the older you get the harder it's going to be to do it\nAnd as I was preparing for today I was thinking that\nOften I hear the sons and daughters describes their parents as being stubborn [noise]\nAnd I take that really as as a compliment but also it's an apt description [noise]\nAnd I can I can hear\nRelatives of mine and clients of mine saying I'm perfectly capable of taking care of myself what do you mean I Need to get someone in here or I'm perfectly capable of taking care of my house I'm going to be putting up the Christmas decorations on the ladder and just a couple of weeks and\nThere isn't anything I Can't do in this house a lab and doing it for six years and I'm going to keep doing it and on and on\nAnd the the one I don't want to go live with all those old people is is age old [laughter] so what do you do when you see that\nYou're you have family members that are really showing signs of meeting some assistance and you know every time he was tried to bring up the subject the church shut down immediately\nAnd if you live at a distance from your family or if there is dementia involved you've just compounded the problem immensely\nSo one of the things that I I suggest doing well first of all start early start when you are having a friendly fun conversation out to dinner enjoying each other's company and just pose a hypothetical question like\nHave you ever thought of getting some help for yourself in the house uh and you're probably going to get a response like I've never had a housekeeper in my life and I'm not going to start now but\nThe way you present it can be you know gee mom you've worked so hard on your life\nWould be nice if you didn't have to lug that vacuum upstairs anymore or\nHave you thought about taking over or lift and not driving into DC just to see her doctors and can you will probably get some push back\nBut there are steps before you get to the takes the keys away conversation so just dropping them and then if you get the push back back off and ...\nBefore you get to the takes the keys away conversation so just dropping them and then if you get the push back back off and continue with the friendly conversation\nOr how long have you had this conversation you're with your daughter she approached you about Bush no okay and she knows better [laughter]", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Mornings on the Mall (WMAL)", "city": "Washington", "day": "14"}
