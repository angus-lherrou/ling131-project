Portland to protest the police shooting [noise]\nBy a guy who was taking was in Boston at the time in a gang shooting he had shot someone was holding a gun and the police told him to drop it and he turned and came towards them with the gun and shockingly they shot him\nUm but they're protesting that scenario uh regardless that's that sets Portland\nWant to talk this morning about why you think we have become so violent why has the violence in this country one group against the other which by the way readers radicals this is the way it's supposed to be but one group against the other\n... ... ... assaulting each other going after each other a why is that who is to blame and and the reason I bring a Portland this morning is these these protesters these anti black lives matter took over the streets of Portland\nThey took over an intersection and they would not allow drivers to go a certain way they took over they directed traffic they force drivers in a certain direction and if you didn't go the way they wanted they insulted you they they it's altered your car here is a here here's one of the the traffic directors for antifa\nDo a little white little\nWhere Whitey are alert guy down the road\nWhitey are allergic to go down the road\nRight now and I said for traffic in\nAnd part of rules for radicals is ... groups and you have the group's fight against each other and that's how you take the government comes in and takes control because the people are so busy fighting each other they don't pay attention what the government is doing it is and also\nThere's like a tremendous amount of leeway given to these protestors again by the press act like oh they called themselves the anti fascist so their costs must be righteous\nMight therefore you know they're they're against ... there's no limit to what you can do you should go to physical war against fascism I'm for it that's basically the frame of they give these guys so they're always for giving their behavior no matter what they're doing\nNow Joe in DC though Joe good morning you're on mornings on the mall Joe who do you blame for this increase in violence\nOr ... or you know these politicians that promote this type of behavior should be held accountable when you have people walking into traffic and taking over society and creating fear for the average person coming home from work with their kids in their cars\nBeing attacked surrounded is absolutely on a quickly unacceptable yes this needs to be dealt with now\nSwept wing and effectively and\nAnybody that's involved in this type of behavior needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the war and these politicians that are promoting this and if there's cause of death serious bodily injury property structuring\nMeant to be held accountable for this type of behavior when you're talking about Trump and all that support is nonsense\nYeah well they do the people that you're talking about just shutting down streets around our families in cars they are terrorizing these families\nThey're not compelling them through political demonstrations or anything they're literally just terrorizing them and that's that's despicable and it's not compelling at all it doesn't actually make us it doesn't bring us any closer to your goals and drives us further apart and that is the opposite of a genuine political protest right\nBut that's not that but that is their goal you know it got so bad and I just want to share this with you at these these protests in uh Portland where they took over the streets [noise] is a homeless guy gotten involved with them because they were protesting the killing the shooting a by the cops of Patrick ... who was involved in a gang\nShooting but do one of the people doing the shooting and the homeless shelter them he shot to people his name was Patrick ... yeah and um and he was gang banging people shooting a name and so some of the protesters confronted him he'd like\nTo people right here

Williams alluding to is kind of shifting the overturn window bracket in in politics and the the idea that you can basically\nTake watches the restoration of American values and say hey actually you know what this is this is this thing that we're telling you you shouldn't like and you see increasingly not like and it should be exercised entirely from American society and uh that and William is really onto a good\nPoint yeah it's a really great point Kevin Burke has a great point to can good morning you're on mornings on them all what's Trump ism\nMore sort of define it as a naturalist at odds with um your pride in Being American you know we don't want to be Europeans the people who come here don't want to be\nLike what they were where they came from that came here to get away from that show let's shouted way in America and I'm not apologetic for anything we've done in our history we've done some bad things but in the\nIn the context of the cultural mores of the times that was what you know for the most part could have been expected you know and as far as Trump personally I created a lot of the things she does but I still voted for him and I still will because he's the right guy for our country right now\nYeah yeah absolutely and I loved the idea of yeah well I don't think we should be ashamed to be American to be proud to be American and President Trump and Trump ism gives voice to that in his unabashedly proud of who we are I think that's a breath of fresh air for a lot of people ate and ate succeeds hero\nAnd then six to five what is Trump ism six twenty two

a category for any time\nFor the season make landfall in the Florida Panhandle historic event there will be lives and property that will be at stake here high water rise very strong points to hurricane force or\nEven getting above one hundred miles per hour hurricane force starts at Seventy four miles per hour but this is going to be a heck of an event for many people not only along the Florida Panhandle but as we get inland south Georgia through the eastern Carolina as possible even southeast Virginia\nNow with ... the the damage really came from the rain it was just so much rain that came from Hurricane Florence and we saw the flooding associated with that what we see the same thing with Michael or is that the damage going to be from the wins\nWell we're going to have everything along the panhandle we're going to have catastrophic storm surge flooding we may not have flooding directly related to falling rainfall because the difference between Florence and Michael is that Michael is going to be moving along twelve fourteen miles per hour to North and eventually northeast or maybe even quicker\nIf you remember Florence was barely moving at all a couple of miles an hour for most of the time to dump the heavy rainfall so as you get into Florida and then south Georgia\nThat is where we may see some flooding with a flash flood watches due to the rain falling and then we think the flooding would be a threat in the eastern Caroline is because of what's happened from Florence\nAs some of the rivers are still at\nA moderate flood stage so the water still hasn't received it all the way to where it should be so traditionally maybe a five to eight inch rain of it which is this is going to be\nYou know may not have you thinking well widespread flooding but in eastern Carolina does especially North Carolina oh there could be what we're hoping is that Michael pickup forward speed and accelerate out off towards the north and east\nEven quicker but at this point we do think not only more flooding in around eastern and central north and South Carolina in South Georgia but wind damage to it's going to take a while for this storm to wind down even though it's got to be moving quickly we could have tropical storm force winds all the way through the eastern Carolina as maybe southeastern Virginia has been going through the day tomorrow in into tomorrow night\nWe are seeing images this morning out of Panama City the water already lapping yes the U.S to support structure to the homes on the beach there\nAre obviously as you say you said catastrophic storm surge expected than as a National Weather service emphasizing this is the last chance to get to a safe place if you have an opportunity to get out this morning as the time to do it because when re does this thing make landfall\nSlower thinking early afternoon so somewhere around Panama City give or take 'em on either side of that and we're looking at a pressure as we said I just saw some new information down to nine hundred and thirty seven milk bars from that aircraft report has the lowest pressure in the month of October for land falling hurricane in us\nSo if it maintains that pressure it rivals hazel back in Nineteen fifty four which it was at nine hundred and thirty eight ... so we've got that and we've got landfall somewhere around Panama City and as you said Vince the watered already started to come up yesterday to a foot or two in terms of water rise\nSome of these spots could be on the high end of the nine to Thirteen foot storm surge that his forecasts here talking almost\nTwo levels of home or a business so to stories\nYou figure the typical ceilings ... if you get close to you know twelve feet you're talking a and a half so at least in to the second floor and many of these structures and that's going to push well inland especially some places where they are normally prone to flooding many places on this current forecast track could have historic storm surge in parts of the pan handle\nYou know read the last couple of really since since Sandy we haven't seen a lot of hurricanes especially big ones but this season we've seen to Florence and now Michael that have been quoted historic storms what's different\nWell had some of it is just you know I don't want to say right place right time but some of that has been unusually strong high pressure\nThat has been with us that does have some correlation to maybe warming sea surface temperatures it's just something the atmosphere that in case of Florence made Florence move much more so that we had a big high pressure system to the north blocking it\nAnd this case I think when we go back and we actually study it may be more a function of just\nYou know wrong place wrong time right where you're in the Gulf of Mexico traditionally the water's warm there I don't know how much further above average they are but they are slightly above normal um we had been in a low in terms of you know strong hurricanes making\nWarm there I don't know how much further above average they are but they are slightly above normal um ... we had been in a low in terms of you know strong hurricanes making impact on us but last year we had um I Believe we have Irma we had Maria that also had impact so\nIt's kind of go into the cycle to where there are some historical records that say you know hurricane seasons every ten years seems to have some data cycle to which\nYou get some walls and then you go back to two thousand three two thousand and five periods where we had that very active period and now we're about in that range where it's been about ten or so years where things maybe\nHave been getting a little bit active again but right you know it's all about impact I mean you could have one storm let's go back to Andrew in Ninety two right oh yeah we hurricane but everybody thinks that was a bad hurricane season now\nWe've had two and two very impactful events maybe historic

Council Bluffs Iowa last night he's off to Pennsylvania today for more on this the guys tracking all of a Charlie sparing White House correspondent for Breitbart News Charlie good morning\nThe morning this morning Mary so the the president has been a trying I think a new campaign theme one of the things that he likes to hit a on the campaign trail and it's going after what he says there's an angry mob of Democrats do you expect that this will be the consistency and we're going to hear over the next few weeks leading into the midterms\nBad delude we he really thinks that this cabinet thing has really energized the base and he's out\nI mean here over the next few weeks leading into the midterms ...\nHe really thinks that this cabinet thing has really energize his base and he's out there just really driving it hard to Democrats you know last night he called the wacko a think last week he called the blue go so he's he's a\nReally going after Democrats for what he feels and a lot of his supporters of 'em was just a just an atrocious confirmation process them very political and very nasty\nPresident we had a discussion earlier about what is Trump ism and I think when you see the president at these rallies this is\nTrump isn't this is who he is this is what he does and I think he gives voice to to what the base and what a lot of quote unquote the forgotten men and women in this country I think\nAny ability to channel exactly how you know average people feel yet this this guy is a billionaire how effective do are these rallies do you think at at riling up some of the independence and moving some of those independents over to the Republican column\nWere apprehended in August on the southern border and the government expects the numbers in September yet to be published to explode well above and beyond that twelve thousand from August yeah\n[noise] and on the heels of that we're finding out that Americans are paying more to cover the cost of illegal immigrants were having children in the United states then what Congress plans to give President Trump to fund the border wall what do we keep hearing from the left it's so expensive it's billions of dollars we could spend this money elsewhere we have a deficit [noise]\nWell it might actually wind up saving us money a new report reveals that women in the United states illegally had almost three hundred thousand children in twenty four team that's the last uh your numbers are available\nAt a cost of two point four billion dollars which is eight hundred million more than the Senate has approved for President Trump's border wall this year\nAnd it's enough to pay for the wall for over ten years\nRight and the reality is this is about ... like government services a health care for one the way that that was provided an a Medicaid\nAlso schools and infrastructure expenditures and all the things that is required for taxpayers to spend on people\nWho are in the United states so when you get pushback from immigration activists on this are always like well it's already legal to give welfare to legal immigrants yes you're right in the very traditional sense but is it illegal for taxpayer money to be expended on them you know it's like constantly being spent\nOn illegal immigrants a lot of it is and then you'll get this one well immigrants add to the economy they add their net benefit to the economy well that's a that's also sleight of hand when you're doing is combining illegal immigrants with legal immigrants and immigrants Broadway or a net benefit to the economy car that illegal immigrants and that Matt what's on his head entirely\nThem and you add to the fact that Medicaid will pay for the delivery even though illegal immigrants as you said and new legal immigrants legal ones new legal immigrants or an eligible for Medicaid the program we'll still cover the cost of delivery and postpartum care\nFor at least a few months for for the mothers to that's added into there as well and remember when you have a child to the child's in America an American citizen and now eligible for benefits\nSo I mean look we just we want to take care of people that make sense but when you create incentives for people to come into the United states and take advantage of the way we take care of people then maybe it's time to rethink it like we should we should reconsider the system\n[noise] illegal immigrants that come from more than one in seven births in Los Angeles Las Vegas San Diego Dallas and Houston in one year twenty fourteen almost three hundred

as the ... the UN ambassador\nShe just things change though when Mike Pompeo comes in when John Bolton comes on board\nAnd that changes in terms of the power dynamics and the extent to which she's she can sort of freelance\nAlso remember there was the ... there was a moment where she was announcing sanctions against Russia where the administration wasn't on the same page Larry Kudlow comes out and start saying well I think she got confused as she fights back well no I don't get confused and it was showing some separation\nThen there's the sort of behind the scenes like the arising that's been going on rocketing around Washington yesterday is this idea that maybe she or somebody on her staff was the author of the anonymous\nNew York times op ed you know the one written by senior Trump official attacking the president characterizing it resistance within the administration that she had taken her self off of the list of suspects potentially by writing the Washington Post op ed in response\nAnd saying hey look if I have disagreements with the president I Wish them to him directly\nWill tell him what I think that's suggesting that she has had some disagreements with the president also\nShe seemed to want to rush to nip and the but any kind of\nTheory that she's preparing for twenty twenty presidential run that she's going to run against Trump as a Republican primary opponent up and to run against the incumbent she said that's not happening I'm supporting the president\nAnd one of the theory that seems to be have been strangled in the cradle really quickly\nIs this idea that she was going to resign Jeff Sessions eventually fired Lindsey Graham made attorney general and then his open South Carolina Senate see would be given to Nikki Haley by governor McMaster demos a lot of players of course uh but right now Lindsey Graham said just two days ago even before Nikki Haley's announcement he said\nI Do not want to be in the cabinet he said he has he has no interest whatsoever about being in the cabinet and the reason he's been asked about this a lot is because the press has been accusing him of auditioning to become the next attorney general by being so forcefully pro Trump of late well\nListen that that theory that you that you just posited could very well still happen that may very well play out because\nLindsey Graham has been far more visible far more forceful than Jeff Sessions an hour and and I'm not saying that the attorney general needs to be partisan I don't want an attorney general that's partisan wanting attorney general that's fair and actually does his job his or her job\nAnd and I don't think that Jeff Sessions is really doing his job unless there are things going on in the background which we are unaware of\nWe we ... we spoke with a credit card or from one America earlier he covers the United nations and he mentioned something that really stood out to him and set out to me to Nikki Haley yesterday in her
