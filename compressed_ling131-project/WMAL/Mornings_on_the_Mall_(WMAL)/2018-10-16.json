American big story yesterday a hilarious one she's one one thousand [laughter]\nA chair it gives the claim a but the DNA thing has been really interesting to me as as yet again somebody turns to to science to make a claim about their past and their connections and their family\nBecause so many people are doing this people are signing up for these various DNA sites or or to get themselves analyzed to forget okay like one of my relatives who are the people that are related to me what's what's my family tree you know what's my actual background with my ancestry what do you know what do I\nWhat what's my racial composition all sorts of questions that people like to tap into that they may not you know there's a whole bunch of people who may not have a great spoken word legacy or documentation who want to find out what's at the bottom of all of this\nBut what's interesting is as more millions and millions of people began lumping in their DNA results into these systems\nLaw enforcement is also turning to these private companies to do their work\nTo assess crimes to try and solve cold cases\nAnd I and and they're\nTo do their work\nTo assess crimes to try and solve cold cases\nAnd I and and there seems to me that there are some civil libertarian ethical quandary that come with those because again this is not a government database dinner voluntary databases are private party third party databases that people are entering their data into sending in the mouth swab sending in the DNA\nThey\nAre trying [laughter]\nYes yeah and they're doing it and around from traditional legal ways to pursue something and think about it how many people right now we're listening has theory or Alexa\nMhm and they use and they have no problem it's up to my daughters from Amazon with it it's\nLike people like for instance I we use ... and I ... everything is measured in trade offs and there is a certain amount of trust that does go into these things and you're right I I Do have\nSort of that nagging instinct that you know there's some of this might go too far and eventually there will be people who abuse it and that's absolutely true\nAnd but then the the other side of this is like for instance Google and your email one of the things that people use email a lot a lot of people used you know it's free some people use it so why is it free\nThe reason it's free is because you're you're coughing up so much data they read all your email well defined read though so what read really means there's no human that can ... possibly be reading all that\nBut it is possible theoretically that someone can abuse their power and getting access to somebody's email definitely and I'm On guard for that\nBut what ends up happening is computers process all of the ... the language and information that shooting through your inbox in order to establish okay what kind of advertisements will we serve so what they're doing is the keyword comparing\nThe information inside of your email now am I comfortable with that level of Google involvement yeah kind of I mean the the the idea that a computer is just serving language to be like okay how do I better serve this guy so I can increase the probability that he collects an advertisement\nThat doesn't offend me at its core when I'm On guard for his people abusing that power to serve value to go after you to harass you all that stuff\nAnd that clearly there are perilous element to this that involved that stuff that you want to be on guard for and that's why you hope a company that's worth so much wouldn't abuse those things for fear that they will collapse as an industry\nRight well let's take our rapist All right so are rapists and we we got his DNA the guys that I got this right well what if they find out oh he's got Alexa so let's subpoena the records let's find out what he's talking about in his home maybe we find out because we think he might have committed this crime let's see if he's talked about it\nIn his home yeah we with anybody so let's get that information from Alexa oh well unless ... let's see what he's ordered off Amazon bag by getting the or his more TV let let's get that information was he talking about was watching T. right they can get all that information of what you're doing in your home that you think is private yeah and that's the problem for me and I and\nI'm with you I said I have no sympathy for the rapist and the story because obviously this is the guy that that's a terrible person the person who I Would have sympathy for in your set up is the person who's falsely accused\n[noise] right but but my point is regardless of that everybody says I'm okay with it is that right I have nothing to hide you think you have nothing to hide mhm but you don't know what

a which cock and planning getting the testing and shaded by herself it had to check in on um in fact he did pull positive for one of the genes not for the answer but or on um I think it was sort of

and a ... where she gave me the warnings you said make sure before you do the testing Iraq or life insurance squared away\nAnd I was very puzzled by that and come to find out\nThat even though she that she got the positive for the gene but then had the surgery to remove the issue on one the bank said go get destroyed insurance or they destroy collateral on up for their loan\nUm she went back to

the county or good morning\nIt was a survey released last week that showed that Americans really dislike political correctness and it cuts of its cuts both ways like eighty percent of the country or something does not like political correctness and this tracks across racial groups to\nA white people Seventy nine percent of them had to say that political correctness is a problem in this country Asians eighty two percent said that\nHispanics eighty seven percent American Indians hello Elizabeth Warren eighty eight percent of the political correctness has a problem um and among African Americans\nOr an eighty eight percent said political correctness has a problem\nUm and uh\nAmong African Americans Seventy five percent opposed political correctness so if you're ever thinking to yourself man this is just a Republican issue or just a democratic issue no it's not it cuts both ways and you've got people cross the line who do not like political correctness or ... that they find it insufferable in fact\nI'm here's this researchers have looked into this they ... they spoke to one forty year old American indian and Oklahoma who said this during a focus group\nQuote it seems like every day you wake up something has changed do you say Jew or Jewish is it a black guy African American\nOr you risk your livelihood by openly speaking your beliefs bill monitor walks the line so that he can keep his job keep his livelihood and and\nIt's just see what I'm saying like he said that's why he ... he donates to Democrats that is why he he comes all strict Democrat but I can I can criticize a little bit\n[noise] sure I mean well I I Do think I I like when he says these things because I agree with them first of all of core and secondly I Do the kind of see it as an act of bravery in a party that does not reward these types of conversation so you're right maybe this a little bit he is buying himself some insurance that when he had these types of conversations\nBy donating millions to Democrats but I Want to give you one other at least one other example that he is just one quick I just love on Bill Maher show when he does this and the panel is we're all liberal yeah ... they were in sort of ... but it's like it's like ana Navarro\nOn the view as the Republican okay so so he'll he'll usually has all ... all liberals and they look at him like wait a minute is this a trick yes swimming on here it looks so befuddled and confused because bill monitor isn't just parroting what they what they already feel and it's that part for me is the best\nPart of ... so here's another example of this political correctness that he brings up last week Scott Kelly the astronaut famously\nQuotes Winston Churchill onto what I remember those yes so he quotes Winston Churchill 'em by the way it was to attack Kavanaugh supporters that's why he quoted Winston Churchill whatever the Twitter mob attacks him first sighting Winston Churchill and he apologizes and he says he's going to study Winston Churchill atrocities\nThis all happened listen to ... when\nScott Kelly you're familiar with the Austria okay he tweeted one of the greatest leaders of modern time sir Winston Churchill said in victory magnanimity I guess those days are over\nTo where she would apology for the for quoting Churchill because church or a girl or living standards of the Nineteen okay let me let me just selfish for this because\nThey said I did not mean to offend by quoting Churchill my apologies I Will go under kick myself further on his atrocities this was a guy who said this from the Nazis and and you know he's a he was a fighter pilot married to Gabby Giffords\nWas shot and I'm sure if he continues on and somebody and people on Twitter and no one denounces his and he has to make an old up when the Trump people go yes people are too fragile government too fragile\nTo be in charge yeah and and he's so right with this\n... this is the other problem with the left is they don't put anything in historical context as bill Myer said there is that Oh yes he was living by the code of the time you know you make certain Churchill created you know made the mistake of living by the code of the time we lose historical\nReference when it comes to these things you have to understand what was the norm at the time it wrong now but\nThat's the way it was at the time and you have to take things in that context and we don't we just everything through the eyes of today which is just ridiculous is dumb right dumb way to look\nAt him more more corrections for political correctness

prevent\nAnd eventually my parents and they survived the great depression survived clerk ... falls they went through a lot of hard time they raised three boys my older brothers all of whom went off to the military\nThey raised me they knocked around and it was tough\nBut they hung together they hung together for sixty three years\nThe struggle was real they you know what they all look too because they loved each other so much despite her\nBeing a Native American and his family's a distance dismay with that and they're not position to that surrounded them over there mixed marriage but oh let me let me ask you a question of Vince I'm if I'm wrong in saying that uh people found wedding announcements\nFor them you know you're totally right through the local newspapers had wedding announced but they're all he had out they were blaring wedding announcements it's a very unusual or ... you don't usually they're usually a having a little bit of secret wedding and all of a sudden blaring wedding announcements in the local paper it's a weird way to engage your family yeah\nIt it is odd so so there's that question you know and they were married at a church\nBut I thought they ... they didn't go to Vegas no they didn't like it wasn't like the little white chapel in Vegas where they hire some justice of the peace now ever interesting there were a in a\nChurch so President Trump as we all know has has seized on this and he calls her Pocahontas at every turn that he possibly because he said he knows that she's probably gearing up for twenty twenty run and so he has just murder over there and it's amusing and that's yeah he likes it so much and he talks about you know because you talked about her high cheekbones\nWell my mother always told us because of our high cheekbones that we had a Native American ancestors you know because of the high cheekbones she did say that the president said look she gets a DNA test I Will do need a million dollars to the charity of her choice\nIf she gets a DNA test improves that she's Native American so Elizabeth Warren got the DNA test which by the way now is accessible to the government so she's she's one of those people who got that DNA tests and\nHer name popped up as a suspect in a cold case [laughter] yeah it was weird it involves a leading people to the trail of tears apparently oh you didn't know\nActually there is a story while we're on that subject Breitbart ran a story a couple of years ago making fun of Elizabeth Warren for all this not making but they they reported that supposedly she has an ancestor that may have actually been a part of a Tennessee militia that did lead people to the trail of tears [laughter]\nWhich if that's true her family history is very dark up it's like she's a Hatfield animal quoi yes she's every grade she's both she's whenever you needed to be\nThanksgiving is awful in their home um but [laughter]\nSo she she did this and the ... is it about this you know there was like the president's mocking her it's funny this is just hilarious because she didn't think this is going to come back in hunter any dead and we have the numbers for you and you're dying to know\nHow Native American well is Elizabeth\nWarren she I'm dying and I and I know we're about to get through it and I can't wait but remember the first rule of trolls is not to engage them and she did all of the wrong things here

it's been I think since the seventies since the since New Jersey's actually elected a Republican there and ... and has actually I'm a has has really close the gap in that race is some polls showing\nA dead heat and ease the way he's been doing that is talking about these ethics troubles with Bob Menendez a he's he's a wealthy guy bought you can as it's been a lot of money running ads are talking

that will introduce you to how to use their formula and proprietary website there aren't secured returns\nSo how will be allowing this to happen again I said this is this is okay who who didn't blame\n... well the question is are these ... these banks stupid or are they just counting on the federal government and the tax payer bailing them out when these banks when these loans fail I mean look all you need is a slight decline in the in the housing market right and people walk away from them mortgages and you'll ... you'll she literally\nTens of thousands of people you know coming to Washington for a bailout\nA on these loans and and that's exactly what happened in two thousand seven eight nine and my biggest frustration with Washington is we never we never learn the lessons from Alaska prices here we are just ten years later doing exactly\nWhat we were doing a back in two thousand\n... seemed like the ... are right for this as you have like housing prices of course are rising banks are being given some confidence I guess the housing prices wants to keep rising if you're having trouble with your mortgage you can sell your home and you'll be fine we don't have to worry too much about losing money on this thing\nAnd simultaneously the fed is raising rates which means people who get into adjustable rate mortgages a\nCouple of years from now I'm going to be looking at payments are like wow I Can't really afford that anymore and the conditions seem to be prime for these subprime loans to screw us again\n[noise] ... exactly right fence and you know I I wrote a column about a year or two ago and the Washington Times that really resonate with people I got thousands of of uh of responses to it where the title of the piece was\nWhy I Can't get a mortgage and it it was making this point that you know I have a very good credit rating I pay my first mortgage I paid my mortgage payment every month for\nYou know in fact I've made double payments and you know if a ... and and I was going to put like Fifteen twenty percent down on the house you know and yet I got denied it got the night the mortgage\nFor you know meanwhile people are putting down to ... their ... you know the the threat of me if you put ten or Fifteen or twenty percent down on a home you're ... you're the the um\nThe probability of a default is close to zero and yet people watch and maddening about this is a meanwhile the government is providing a hundred percent tax payer guarantees\nOn two or three and four percent and now is zero percent down payment laws I mean it's just not fair to people right that that they have to pay more in taxes the ... people for homes but I'm all for homeownership\nI think homeownership was one of the great things in America yeah so the idea that you're going to give people a mortgage on of two hundred thousand dollar house with ... down payment it's just a license to steal\nLet me play devil's advocate with you these are fixed loans so they're not they're not they're able to do with that is not going to go up\nThey have to do to make education sessions about the program they have to submit obviously all the necessary documents and didn't have to go to counseling and understand their monthly budget to make sure that they understand the mortgage payments and what they can and cannot afford also\n... in this program they have to live in the home in order to get the loan so they'll be less likely to just walk away from it because it's their home the ...\nThen you have to ... in the program you have to go through a a a sort of education program to understand what your what your payments are going to be and so on and so forth but that's all fine and good\nBut it still comes down to the fact that if you get a a decline in the you know is this was saying you know when interest rates go up obviously home values or negatively affected by that because it costs more to\nGet a mortgage and so you know you could see it a slight downturn in the in the market and all you need is a is a five or ten percent reduction and housing values and all of a sudden these people actually have negative equity in the home that's why the down payment is so important in my view is I look I'm very old fashioned about this\nThe way to stop or prevent another housing mortgage crisis or the melt down that we saw in two thousand made its just go back to ten percent down payment\nIf you look at the mortgages that failed\nAlmost none of them had ten Fifteen twenty percent down payment almost none of them and that's because if you have skin in the game and you said in the you know if you actually put money down they're not going to walk away from from that equity you have in the house the problem here Mary is none of these people have any equity so they don't have any incentive to\nYou know to uh to stay in the home and by the way I looked at a lot of the homes that were foreclosed on under these programs and people would trashed the houses to\nThe kind of condition that people left these homes and it was it was a terrible thing to see and and I just don't want to see a repeat of that kind of crisis by the way the biggest um you know the biggest bailout had to go to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which were the\nFederal insurers of these mortgages\nYeah we'll see thank you we appreciate this now were all scared\nBailout had to go to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac which were the federal insurers these mortgages\nYeah well Steve thank you we appreciate this and now we're all scared um and you need to track down the person who's in
