I'm not voting I sat down the line I gotta go let's go to William in Virginia William good morning your mornings on them all does this keep the Republican base fired up through to the midterm\nMorning where I'm going to highlight but\nThere should be Trump's um messages\nFor all the new show him or her in search of those ... said by a or a Weinstein wherever leaked out that other than that though why did they sit on their part\nIn it and the message is you're going oh\nYeah it's a great question and it's one that Mitch McConnell Yeh is making a priority he's he's called on the Senate Judiciary committee to launch an investigation this weekend a into how that got leaks in the first place who was leaking\nDr Ford's letter and you know Dianne Feinstein has denied that we heard Susan Collins on friday during her speech\nYou know she came out and given pretty forceful speech on behalf of Republicans and why she was voting yes for Brett Kavanaugh but at the same time says that she knows Dianne Feinstein really well and she said I'm confident she didn't leak this thing\nSo what happened we do deserve a leak investigation and if Democrats are sincere in any way about considering Dr Ford safety and her intentions and what she wanted\nThen they should be right there with Mitch McConnell calling for an investigation\nAnd we'll see if that happens she they shouldn't be there we'll see if they are ... to interview him out\nOf a new was tonka from you Associated Press ground game posted by ABC digital editor making great room it was a weekly conversation with a B reporters and guest above the political issues around the country ahead of this year's midterm elections\nOn apple pie August\n... part of owning a premium appliance excite the them out on that you didn't just shout the installation and apply it to me kept him installation for that you need\nScale than expertise to break away at brains guard from cutting granted to modifying your cabinet tree aren't there to fight in salaries are kind of an installation apart from Walla in filth in refrigerators you name it including brand like sub zero in law\nFor custom installation track the breakaway brands where it doesn't cost more to get more [noise]\nRemodeling your kitchen doesn't have to be overwhelming but bringing scarf manager project from start to finish and get great deals now on the appliances to make it happen\nLike special savings on select mush packages plus free bonus appliances with select Thurmond or purchases bringing the scars kitchen remodeling experts do it all and they do it right from kitchen designing measurement all the way through installation remodel your kitchen brand scar hurry and now or visit brand scarf dot com\nGetting quality medical care shouldn't be complicated but the fact is the traditional primary care model can be frustrating impersonal and confusing it's Larry O'Connor and for years now I've been sharing how happy I Am but I joined the growing number of people who've taken control of their health care and move to a concierge medical practice\nMy doctor is Dr Jones with the ... medical team at principle medical group\nSo what is it that sets Dr Jones apart with principle medical group I receive superior primary care and personalized preventive care I never have to wait for appointments I'm never rush and I have twenty four seven access to Dr Jones who actually knows me\nIn personalized preventive care I never have to wait for appointments I'm never rush and I have twenty four seven access to Dr Jones who actually knows me and by medical history personally so why don't you check it out for yourself and schedule your free consultation with Dr Jones at his McLean office\nCalled seven three six six three eighty twenty four or go on line two principal medical group dot com\nThe landscape of health care is changing but the principles of good tears shouldn't call seven three six six three eighty twenty four or online at principle medical group dot com\nSo here's the story that may sound familiar\nI used to post to several job boards only be overwhelmed with tons of the wrong resume than because there were so many resumes that was tapped to separate the great candidates from those who weren't the ...

real staying on Michael ... and how he contributed to the U.S up to this entire conversation and\nShe said you know we have to roll I of course on the presumption of innocence and the thing that

morning nice to have you\nKnow there are let's talk\nAbout a Brett Kavanaugh now the newest Supreme Court justice and I wonder for Democrats like yourself as they consider election day uh it with him becoming a Supreme Court justice does this energized Democrats are will Democrats beef or depressed by their leaderships failures to stop Brett Kavanaugh\nFor I think in my view the political effect of this on the house side will be to dramatically increase the Democrats' chances in the elections are by energizing people particularly moderate Republican women people in swing district\nSo strongly helped the Democrats in the house ... on the Senate side it's certainly a creates a problem for Democrats running in red states and it'll probably hurt that affect us in pre determine the outcome of either house or Senate election but that's my objective opinion about the political impact of it\nYou know as a moderately Republican woman I really tend more libertarian\nUm I have to tell you I thought what happened and Brett Kavanaugh was terrible and I was all about what are the facts of the case like I I I guess I kind of bristle at the Democrats saying that because I'm a woman I should think a certain way um I was all about the facts of the case so\nI don't think anybody says that a Republican woman should think a certain way I I think what so rich thinking for myself I Can't speak for anybody else I never said that Kavanaugh was guilty or innocent of anything I never\nStated what I consider to be facts\nAbout innocence forget what I did say\nAnd what I think every Republican democratic women and men should have should have stood for and didn't it all the evidence should have been considered by the Senate Judiciary committee that was not\nIt should have been considered a
