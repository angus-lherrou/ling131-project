he knows it almost better than anybody among Capitol Hill reporters he's widely respected I follow this guy on Twitter because I I Need to see everything that ... saying about the process\nOr and so he's he's kind of dug into this and I'm going to rely on on his version of it is here to explain what's going on with Mitch McConnell and this vote\nApparently McConnell's been using some tactics within the Senate in order to ... to stop Democrats from interrupting\nThe cabinet confirmation process this week in a meaningful way it started last friday night McConnell manage to start Senate debate on Kavanaugh's nomination\nThey're going to find new ways and then that turns out they might even like those ways or they may even find convenient ways that they feel like work for them\nAnd they're like you know why am I going to go back to metro why am I going to go stand on a freezing platform and wait for a train that may or may not come is going to take me forever to get to work\nAnd I realize what metro trying to fix these things that's why they like oh we have all these backlogs years of backlogs of maintenance issues if we can fix them now means we're going to be great going forward okay we're going to need you to prove that to us but\nPeople keep people are just kind of going away and they're increasing prices and they're limiting hours I\nSo I mean it's so so what are the solutions here\nAmong the cook claimed solutions um our launch all day peak service\nWhich is in other words everyone has to pay more for metro that's that does raise prices on literally every one you there is no no rush hour service now everyone just has to pay a premium um extend yellow line service the Green Belt\nAnd then run all eight car trains and overhaul the metro bus system\nNow that they all they peak service thing we're like you know we need to do is just raise fees how does that help with your ridership slide\nIt it doesn't it's like ... we have decreasing tax revenues we need to tax people more and then another no that doesn't make any sense [noise] my you know my big bugaboo with the metro is the whole card system how they do it\nWhat was the last time I saw you in the metro when I couldn't get out remember yes and couldn't get out of the metro\nWe weren't even schedule to each other [laughter] I just read that Mary [laughter]\nGases like stuck because when I went\nIn and they swiped him my card\nApparently it didn't register it but I swipe card so wouldn't let me out\nI just put more money on the car and it wouldn't let me out it it you know it's that system I'm Sorry it wastes time you should pay when you go in and be done with it get rid of this peak fair off fair this they're that they're one right one flat rate and you choose how far you want to go if it's one stop maybe you should walk\nIf you don't want to say what are the two Seventy five or three but whatever it happens to be\nProcessed price and you can transfer for free and more people would ride I\nHate Iran has restocking your card is one giant annoyance and by the way and it creates a bunch of machines and operations and maintenance that need to be done on those machines why doesn't if it wasn't like the easy path system\nWhy can't a disconnect a credit card on line and just Everytime ate like oh well your heart might get stolen and somebody might use it and run it up okay we'll have like some sort of failsafe mechanism for that or you know or get to the point where we can use our phones and do like the apple pay and he actually verification that kinda thing\nBut the point is like like there are a whole bunch of things seem to be changed clearer signage make it we have this is a city full of tourists the tourists have no idea how to travel to metro\nNone they ... they like it would be cheaper if you didn't have to pay someone to stand there to teach people and help people how to figure out how to buy a card and whether it's peak or off peak on this and that and everything else\nCan you just hire people who yell at people who stand on the escalator on the left oh I'll do that I just need a guy and a half of the escalator preferably yet but Mary I'm Sorry to say this but you're not the right built for it I Want like a bouncer\nLike just barking orders I can be scary can you oh you know that sorry I find you can do it thank you [laughter] six ...

they'll grow up with recycling and you need you know sometimes you have to separate depending on where you live you have to keep you can't just single stream recycling sometimes when I was really little kid we we're recycling and we had a separate different colored glass and\nAnd they didn't take it up when I was a real little kid you had to bring it down to the recycling center and we love to go if you were good you got to go and they had these big outdoors\nThese big cinder block like being outside and you throw the glass into the Ben Jealous kid no safety goggles or anything or the ruined glass and it's just smash in and out no safety but nobody last deny everything was by\nAnd then of course they started to pick it up but we still had to agree I don't think you could be on the Supreme Court with that behavior pilot on my finger management apparently [laughter]\nAh but but we still had to separate you know brown glass clear glass green glass and then you had newspapers and then other like like magazine but and then they finally moved to single stream well now looks like recording the other way Arlington County\nI may get rid of recycling class because they say it makes no economic sense\nIt currently cause the Arlington government about forty three bucks\nFor every ton of trash that it sends to be burned\nBut it costs them Seventy two dollars per ton\nTo dispose of recyclables and then the government gets back rebates from processors who buy those recyclable products mhm to make other things and that's based on the value of the material and just like anything else it goes up and down well right now there's a negative market value for glass so early to is losing money\nOn glass and it's difficult for processors to recycle glass products\nSo ... it's losing money on glass and it's difficult for processors to recycle glass products don't sell a lot of it that gets bought by these processors winds up getting destroyed like read the regular trash anyway\nSo they say you know we need to step going through the process which I Can't blame 'em and that's really what's happening but I Can't\nBelieve government officials are considering the cost of something
