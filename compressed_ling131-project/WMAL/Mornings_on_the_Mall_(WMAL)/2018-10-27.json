I. G. A. I. G. believed that real estate would always go up or at least stay the same so they didn't think they had too much risk at all and the money was too good to turn down\nAnd so because they had this incredible exposure\nHey I G was basically on the brink of bankruptcy but a lot of pension funds from around the world relied on a I G so in the movie you know they\nWant one of the ministers in France had called up and said you better not let them go damn I'm trillions of dollars worth of life insurance was held by a I G and so people will basically be exposed if it happens to unfortunately die at the wrong time and\nIt really would have been a cataclysmic event and so in the ... in the space of one week it showed how has it\nTime and it really would have been a cataclysmic event and so in the ... in the space of one week it showed how has the treasury wants to show that it was strong and it wasn't going to help support the bad behavior of the banks so they allowed Lehman Brothers to fail\nWe're going to be at the home of sweets in Springfield, Virginia and so for the folks down south you know folks in Woodbridge and Stafford or the folks over and in Fort Washington or Alexandria they'll come and visit us home would sweets in Springfield on Saturday November third ten am\nWill also have classes at the ... trade academy Baltimore as well as the olive tree academy and Tyson's corner the tri county Baltimore's right out for one hundred Ninety five and two Ninety five\nDownload trade academy Tyson's corner is a Spring Hill road so if you're ... metro accessible and get on the silver line and we're short walk from the silver line metro ... Spring Hill road stop 'em but also anyone northern Virginia can access the Saturday November third ten am\nWe have other dates as well so Thursday November first we're going to be an Alexandria we're also going to be up in Germantown on Thursday November first\nAnd friday November second we're going to be out and do all this corner and also in Columbia town center and so part of this as you know we started this year with the mission of reaching ten thousand students a touching ten thousand folks this year\nAnd so in November we're going to pass that number\nAnd part of that is is that this there's been a huge demand for people to learn about becoming a do it yourself investor\nAnd it's also you have the opportunity for you to start saying and realizing that you are on your own but there's never been a better time for you to be engaged with the market\nAnd so you know folks that are looking for strategies to generate lifetime income\nYou know we're going to have Sam side and on and he'll talk a little bit about you know how to create your own annuity in the next segment\nAnd part of that is just realizing that whatever the financial services industry provides for you you can do yourself and not pay them the fees and not incur the same level of expenses related to that so if you want a mutual fund does it do it yourself investor you can create your own mutual fund [noise]\nIf you want an annuity has to do it yourself for best you can create your own annuity and not pay commissions not pay fees not pay the same level of expenses if you do it yourself and if you're looking for a kind of a safe investment is going to\nProtect your principal and make sure that you get a opportunities for outside whether that stock market upside or upside other markets that are trending up\nTheir strategies you can use to protect yourself but more importantly give you the peace of mind\nAnd so part of what we do students is help you develop your own personalized success plant so every student that comes in works with an education counselor\nThat education counselor helps you identify you know what assets you have and then one of those assets are currently unproductive because remember and unproductive asset is anything that's designed to get single digit or negative returns\nAnd for most people the majority if not all of their assets are in unproductive opportunities\nAnd so what we want to reduce our identify more productive uses for that unproductive asset and think about this if you were operating yourself as a business if you were going to be a business person would you ever invest your hard earned capital in something designed to generate two three four percent\nThere's no way you would do that right you're looking for you know ten percent twenty percent beyond that and that's what we wanted to start thinking about with your financial assets it stopped being satisfied with these mediocre returns and open yourself up to the opportunities around you as a do it yourself investor\nWith one of the things we know today is that you know people are wealthy but they don't feel wealthy so we have a number of students that came in this week who had a nice income but they're still living paycheck to paycheck 'cause they have so many expenses between college education student loans car payments\nAnd part of this if as you taking control of your own income\nAnd realizing that you have time that you can be using more effectively focused on learning how to generate more income and the financial markets and recognizing that you know as friendly as they are you know the conventional financial services folks aren't for you\nAnd ally back is telling you that they're they're insiders and they're telling you that folks in their industry are not looking out for your best interest\nAnd yeah they're basically you know they call the other bankers as a bank robbers or if back at me I'm packing two guys make two thousand nine instead of calling them gangsters they're called banks there's\nBecause they just figured out how to extract money from us as individuals and keep it for themselves and so as a do it yourself investor we want you to understand that\nYou've got to start learning how to protect your money and that's the first lesson particularly in this market environment\nWith increased volatility market's going up markets going down and ...\nHow to protect your money and that's the first lesson particularly in this market environment with the increased volatility market's going up markets going down and adds that ... happens that's more opportunity for do yourself investor there's more fear\nFor someone to use the conventional approaches cause of conventional approaches don't work in a highly volatile market they basically need a sweeping market where things just go up up up well that moment has passed okay we've had that for a few years we're no longer in that sleepy market where now in a high volatility market\nAnd the high volatility market if all you have the conventional financial approaches that's a really scary market\nHowever if you have the tools of do it yourself investor\nAnd you add all proven system that you can use to find safer and smarter places to buy and sell\nAnd you understand how to lead bridger assets and then also have to make sure that for any risk you take you understand it but also you have an opportunity for greater award here that's the foundation for you know learning how to generate money has to do it yourself a best er\nIt's also the foundation for learning any skill you know if you want to learn something new\nYou need to get the probability in your favor by\nGoing to someone with a proven system so learning about a proven system learning from someone who has more experience has had success in that business or that would that skill and given your and learning how to practice in a focused matter so focused practices central\nTo allow you to start getting better better skills and better results in your life also to elaborate she wanna leverage other people's knowledge you want to liberate other people's resources\nAnd no matter what scale you're learning getting probability on your side\nGetting leverage on your side is part of how you learn when you went to school you use their textbooks you use their chairs you have their expertise to allow you to build up your skill build up your confidence and then once you start then the next step is to help them understand your risk and how to reduce the risk\nIn any action you take\nAnd part of that as learning the rules of the game and learning how you know you can you know what your best that in the game and learning how your opponents thing and that's how you start developing an edge\nDevelop any skill including the skill of do yourself investor so part of the class that you'll be attending is focused on give you to understand probability leverage risk reward and doing that and the financial markets but recognize\nThat's how you learn any skill as by giving probability leverage risk reward on your side and that's what you've done up to this point in your life and going forward and to develop your lifetime income strategy you know a strategy that's going to get you from here to a hundred\nYou need to get probability on your side\nMaster leverage and

how he's also certified organic and free range rich village the cat back on every hand the toothpaste the olive oil and the sham long every day I\nHave let's just ten year old nephew beat him in virtual tennis and even though he industry does does lay ten year old\nWhen the toilet paper is running low\nWrench replaces the rules on the actual holder\nNot just on the back of the toilet\nRange now\nDoing range\nI was just telling everyone how great you are\nMakes people look\nVisited stabbed tanks\nI was just telling everyone how great you are\nMakes people look\nIs it stopped textile correct that Oregon\nPublic service announcement brought you by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\nOr our military service members volunteer to protect us and the most dangerous places around the world they step up our when they're severely ill or injured\nLike you said unless you have the confidence um it's it's a scary place to be and what I'm getting at is you know the vast majority of people their financial wellbeing and their life just ebbs and flows with the rise and fall of the stock market and we've all seen how that story ends\nAnd the people have most of their money in the stock market are the ones with the least amount of confidence and we have people come in all the time telling us they're afraid of that market drop right right\nThat's what ... so as we get back to the perfect investment so before characteristics and how do you start putting that together\nSo it yeah what everybody wants obviously there are big games low or no risk low fees and a liquidity many I can I can you have access to my money pretty much what I wanted\nAnd of course everyone laughs when you talk about those the foreign grandchildren well that doesn't exist with absolutely does exist and um again it's not something that you're going to see on TV or learn about the book is a Wall Street certainly doesn't want the average person to do we're going right now what we're getting out right now\nSo it's like a financial unicorn right people think they'd like to exist they don't believe it really does ... do you do is actually show people how to create that financial unicorn\nIt to the average person than the unicorn too for the wall street from it's a it's a horse that they deal with every day there\nAnd and not only do they deal with it they repackage it and sell it and they slice it and dice it\nYeah yeah and and it's really not a it's it's it's you know it's not that hard to understand so I guess if we start to unpack it right\nSo what we do is and and and you know we do this is something that you do yourself but you know how to do and we leave we and we teach this and we executed or for for people that have this concern in need 'em first up so\nIt starts with where your money's invested so instead of having all your investment capital in the stock market right whatever age you are whenever you have um\nDon't have any of it there instead put it into fines or you know interest generating\nA vehicles right for example um corporate bonds or in this day and age there's some pretty good bond funds out there there's not a lot but there's two or three really good ones and um for talking short maturity high yield very safe\nAnd would that be reducing the risk and basically you're limiting stock\nMarket or you're limiting stock market risk but now you have this pile of money generating income generating interest income\nWhat we do is that as we use the options market so instead of buying the stock market by owning stocked we can buy options on the stock market\nOr specifically find calls if you don't understand why cause our options again instead of buying the actual market\nYou are buying the option to buy the market so it's it costs so much less far less money than to actually buy the stock but you still get the benefit of the gains of the stock market so I'm so essentially what we're putting together what we've put together as a\nGift buying options on the market so if the market goes up you make money\nIf it goes down\nYou ... your principal you're not losing any of your principal cause your money's not actually in the stock market site\nAnd so it's totally protected and then at the same time you use an extra income to buy the calls which gives you\nThe upside gains in the market now there's nothing there's no risk right I mean I'm so where is the risk in this investment you're only risk is in the credit risk of the bombs right so um now I I Can't remember any time that there's been a follow up on his fault that you stick with safe stuff [noise] and um and that's\nPart of the analysis that she helped me to walk through sure so once they own the calls how frequently would they do that would just be once a month once a quarter once a year\nYeah barely once a month this is not an active strategy it's a very hands off but essentially the end what you've created is stock market gains with zero stock market risk to your principal\nAnd I'm fees are low because you're doing yourself extremely low and I'm kind of liquid he's fine and the interesting\nThing is that's exactly what Wall Street does when they create an annuity and we have a lot of people that are buying annuities because they want safety and what you're you just laid out how they can do it themselves what they said if they do it themselves\nOh yeah so I'm also suggest tobacco but you need that um [noise] what were essentially saying here as\nThis is how you can build your own ingenuity and remove the fees\nRemoved the whole you know ten to twenty year lockup period and all that stuff and um\nWhat what Wall Street dogs with the exact strategy\nWell you know and a twenty year lockup period and all that stuff and um\nWhat what Wall Street does with the exact strategy that we just laid out is you know they put it in a pretty box and with a pretty ribbon and had season and lock up periods and surrender charges and everything else and it's called an annuity right and and you know the United states I mean billions of dollars every year goes into\nNew lease right so um [noise] and uh and\nAnd the people that are paying for their brochures and all the fancy offices basically get to keep all that for themselves if they use the strategy you just laid out [noise]\nSure you don't yeah exactly uh you know you can learn how to do this and do it yourself and there's other things but again starting on the wall street side of the business you know you learn simple strategy is like this and how things really work\n[noise] and we know to be an effective do yourself investor you need to get educated to our sponsor online training academy is making ten seats available to a free half day class so you can

through how we can use the tools of\nBeing a do it yourself investor and if we understand how the market's really work\nWe can use the same strategies that the professional banks to use on us and then charges the high fee to take advantage of\nBecause you know there's there's a time in life when I have been annuity makes a lot of sense there's a time in life where to get that steady stream is really beneficial and but at the same time if you learn how to do it yourself\nYou don't have to pay the commissions you know an annuity is the highest commission product out there in the financial services industry and sometimes it's basic ten percent right off the top\nAnd then on top of that on an annual basis you know they're charging fees ... four to seven percent per year\nWhereas if you learn how to do it yourself you'd have to pay some be some expenses related to it but no fees and you'd be able to preserve the benefit of your assets that you've worked so hard for\nFor you as well as for your family and for your legacy and so part of wanting to do is start sinking bigger about the opportunities that are out there\nAnd you know the financial services folks have a great job of beating down your expectations and get need to be happy and making three four or five percent on your money\nYou know as a do it yourself investor we want to find more productive uses for assets you know we're going to start looking at ourselves like a business and making business like decisions with our money and if we're going to make a business decision we're going to look for productive uses of our assets you know double and triple digit opportunities [noise]\nAnd so this week one of our students re a walk me through\nOr assets you know double and triple digit opportunities [noise]\nAnd

twenty twenty candidate close when you have a white male making the arguments they carry more weight should they carry more weight absolutely not but do they yes well that created a firestorm\nThat's not the only other thing that happened this week Chuck Grassley\nAnnounced that he's referring Michael ... and his client Julie sweat next to the Justice Department for criminal investigation into whether they had engaged in a potential conspiracy to provide materially false statements to Congress or head obstructed justice during the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd the you know turning over to the to the caravan they\nMore or less had their narrative in place about the caravan before the caravan even started and that was a building it more as a humanitarian crisis and you know certainly among the media\nFor example the Associated Press at one point a referred to the caravan is a quote rag tag army of the poor and they immediately had to retract that phrase\nUm and again our friends at the media Research Center a said that most of the networks were very set on\nA offering it very heroic portrayal sympathetic portrayal of the caravan and certainly that's an ongoing story we don't know what's going to happen with that yet but in a really big picture Rick\nUh Americans are getting kind of confused about all this and meanwhile the political divisions\nAre are are clarifying even more and when you have coverage like this and I will end or stagnant here on the media by saying that the wall Street Journal had a poll earlier this earlier this week that found that Ninety percent of Americans\nNow say that the uh incredible political divisions of the nation are a serious problem and eighty percent say that the nation is now invited\nAnd that's not good so a month ago one would have predicted a blue wave becomes flushing across the country but after the cabinet hearings conservatives are firing up and you got some indicators out this week\nYes indeed and I think that's just a great way to put it about conservatives being fired up and let's start with the American Conservative Union or this week they have released they very no nonsense get out the vote message on now running and twenty a key congressional districts around the nation and men in the territories of for example\nUh Dave Brat and Virginia Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington et cetera and this is a a\nA whole are outraged that that ah they're pointing out that all of the the political turmoil and the violence in the streets and so forth and so on they're asking voters is this the America you want to live and it's only a thirty second floor\nAnd I think you can find it on YouTube or with the American Conservative Union\nAnd uh it's titled civility and I did speak with him Walters he's yeah communications director there and just as you said Ricky said as a result of the far left effort to derail\nA Brett Kavanaugh's nomination conservatives who usually only vote and presidential contest years have learned to exactly what is at stake and it's important midterms and uh they say a lot of folks are really committed to showing up on November six in the midterms and uh\nUh they're spending a six figures on getting this particular video out\nAnd interestingly enough about the image of conservative voters now there's a new political morning console poll out there that finds at Seventy five percent of all us voters say they conservatives are indeed motivated to turn out and vote\nAnd uh let's go down the numbers really quick eighty percent of conservatives agree with that along with Seventy eight percent of liberal Seventy two percent of moderates Seventy eight percent of Republicans Seventy one percent of Democrats Seventy percent of men and Seventy three percent of women so I'm getting ready to conservatives are away\nSo we see the extremes on the left the extremes on the road\nAnd it's what people are kind of just losing their marbles in a way and you know what ever happened to sort of a more pragmatic look good things kind of a reality check there is somebody that's going to take a run about on the political side\nIndeed here comes the Libertarian Party libertarian just say well\nThe nation's largest third party is just not going to sit still while all of this was going on and they have declared themselves to be the common sense party at the moment and uh they're putting out a new order message which is amusing but it's it's also engaging as well they say every October before an election\nBoth Democrats and Republicans wrap up fear based campaign the Halloween season is an only for a supernatural stories on macabre imagery that's awesome\nPack rats and Republicans wrap up fear based campaign\nThe Halloween season is an only for supernatural stories and much opera imagery it's also for frightening voters as a strategy for getting out the vote\nThe phenomenon even has a name yeah October surprise again this is coming directly from the Libertarian Party they say libertarians take a different approach\nAnd appeal to common sense Republicans and Democrats the lumbering dinosaur as of American politics will continue to try to scare voters each Halloween season by demonizing each other and offering big government programs on restrictions as their only a solution [noise]\nThey are an interesting group because uh have to remember that the Libertarian Party I think Gary Johnson ended up with four percent of the vote\nA back in the president's all race and um\nThe number of us voters who are actually registered registered as a libertarian says search the the party says by Ninety two percent says two thousand eight and I think uh that were around the twenty sixth day no action they broke a half a million registered voters\nWhich may not sound like much when Republicans and Democrats get in there but ah they can still sway an election here and according to libertarian National Committee chairman Nicholas work\nHe says the grassroots energies we are seeing Eighteen is amazing he is now running for the mayor of Phoenix\nSo you're covering an icon and California politics [noise] man it's been governor for the last seven years in California Jerry Brown of course he's not running for reelection what is his next step at the age of easy\nWell this was I was really intrigued by this one because I got a I'm\nA very interesting message from the bulletin of the atomic scientists now everybody no oh no maybe not everybody knows but I Know that the bulletin of atomic scientists these are the people that run the doomsday\nClock that's the clock is supposed to indicate that we're supposed to blow up or when we're supposed to blow up and they have made been maintaining this kind of grim but iconic symbol the doomsday clock\nSince Nineteen forty seven and if you're curious it is now two minutes to midnight and that is a a record it it is actually a matching a record that was set all the way back in Nineteen fifty three ah won both the United states and the Soviet Union were busy testing nuclear weapons\nAnd just what all of that in mind governor California Governor ed ... G brown junior that Jerry Brown a has now joined the bulletin of the atomic scientists as their executive chairman\nThink about that anyway his message is to the public policy makers and scientists would the information that they need to demand recognize and support those policies that reduce\nMan made existential threats such as nuclear war climate change and disruptive technology\nSo I'm Mr Brown now has a new calling and certainly at the age of ... that's pretty good [laughter] but anyway uh Mr Brown apparel grows and in no way diminishes so that's your Jerry Brown news for the day Rick\nHow fitting for the governor known as governor moonbeams\n[laughter] yes and babies with down stay clock now\nAnd you can read about how we got the name ... be ... in New York Times article this new listening to nobody will mail I keep an eye on CNN and Fox News in Fox News has been promoting the Fox news and what is the Fox nation\nOh yes indeed this is this is the direction you have to go if you were a broadcaster for any kind of news organization just sort of have to cover all your base citizen and reach out and a ... improve your brand and all that kind of stuff but anyway uh let's talk about Fox News for a moment I've\nMentioned before that they have remained the leading cable news network for sixteen years that's how good they are doing what they do a head of MSNBC and CNN and are they are launching very soon something called the Fox nation and this is their\nVersion almost of Netflix in a way it's a new on demand subscription based service they're going to have long and short form programming and all of us star power that Fox News folks love Sean Hannity Tucker Carlson Laura Ingraham\nA and they're saying content you love\nVoice if it matter all at your fingertips and uh they're going to do\nDo they view this new service uh all the way on November the twenty seventh but I bring up now because they have opened up what they're calling the Fox nation founders program that begins tomorrow Sunday and um they're offering all sorts of\nA nifty prices for your subscription and it's really very a reasonable five Ninety nine a month\nFrank authored a nifty prices for your subscription and it's really very uh ... months five Ninety nine a minute and\nA a I'm a senior vice president development and production his name is John family because we are incredibly excited to bring our viewers ex access content and experience is\nFormer Fox stars at on a cannibal price and an on demand era of viewers watching contact whenever and wherever they want\nFox shovel compliment and enhance our our house\nFox News programming for are loyal super fans very very intriguing and can't wait to see what they're doing and also in their prey sale a program which starts ticket to borrow\nConfident and it says ... high quality I'm substantial flavorful but I don't have to prove myself anyone this mine green lethal practically an inspirational poster I Want to possess the character that that is non ... we saw a\nGuy that non grade we serve again try our new nine Greene reached Jimmy ... we were\nComing up in the seven o'clock hour more on the apprehension\nOf the female bomber\nA political roots and John ... and we'll look at the law enforcement so I usually turn his little Tony Shaver also coming up in the show to talk\nWith Sean Carroll is a full measure very interesting conversation on our ... dot com and as soon as the line with Democrats to\nAll coming up on W.

that choose the old saying first impressions are not going to be lasting so\nA Saturday morning update on WMA ... it's great to have you with us and\nWe often talk about crises are problems in the country and there's a lot of talk and sometimes they're vents and things and then kind of slipped off the radar screen and\nNothing ever happens well today there is some action being ticket and you can actually participate and we're joined by Scott hurting the he's the acting special agent in charge of the Washington field division of the drug Enforcement Administration the DEA Scott it's great to have you with us this morning\n... thank you for having me on the radio this morning and given the opportunity to talk about is very important or da\n... one of the crises and problems in this country is the opioid crisis and drug overdoses\nAnd I don't think people really have a sense of how severe this problem is tell us about some of the stats on drug overdoses and opioid deaths in America\n[noise] well the stats are pretty alarming the you know the rate of prescription drug abuse in the U.S is is high and it's not getting any better it is increased since last year they gave me an example in two thousand Seventeen born in Seventy two thousand Americans died as a result of drug overdose\nAnd that more than forty two thousand of those die from opioids that's a hundred and Fifteen people per day\nBut a lot of people look at the number but don't really understand it for instance the Seventy two thousand Americans died last year that's a hundred and Ninety seven people they if you compare it to the amount of passengers and crew an Airbus three twenty commercial aircraft which many of us have flown seats for a hundred and eighty people in in an aircraft\nIf that aircraft crashed and kill everybody on board that so many people are dying from drug overdoses each day in America that's pretty alarming\nSo can you imagine if an airplane full of passengers went down every day how much media attention that would get how much of an uproar an outcry there would be in this country but for some reason I guess because it's scattered all across the country we don't see the victims we don't see the deaths we don't hear about the death\nIt's something that we just not paying any attention to\nWrite and many people think that drug abuse and opioid abuse could happen to them that they're wrong unlike years ago or drug abuse was limited certain areas\nDrug abuse these days does not matter about demographics that can happen to anyone it doesn't matter what your race is what your sex is how old you are or how much money you make it can happen at any quarter of America\nPeople that are professionals blue collar workers it could happen to everybody studies have shown that about eighty percent of the people who use heroin started their addiction with the abuse of prescription drugs\nWhile so I said action is being taken it's being taken today by the DEA because today is national take back day and anyone listening this morning can participate Scott tell us about the initiative\n[noise] national take back the program was actually initiated back in two thousand ten and what it does it provides the public an opportunity to get rid of their unused expired or unwanted prescription drugs\nHelping people to dispose of potentially harmful prescription drugs is just one way is working to reduce the addiction and overdose deaths plaguing this country due to the opioid medications\nFrom some information I've read on this topic people can leave opioids in medicine cabinet and somebody can get into that medicine cabinet whether it's a child somebody that works in the home whatever and that's how sometimes the opioid addiction can get started\nAnd and talking to the people that are abused prescription drugs most of the time they get their drugs for friends and family and including the medicine cabinet\nNow unlike myself along with other people you get a prescription for an ailment or or pain you take several those prescription drugs you don't you finish the entire bottle you put it back in your medicine cabinet\nOr what happens is people sometimes will go into medicine cabinet\nSeveral those prescription drugs you don't you finish the entire bottle you put it back in your medicine cabinet or what happens is people sometimes will go into medicine cabinets seal those prescription drugs and those drugs ended up in the wrong hands on the streets this national peak back they gives the public an opportunity\nTo protect their homes and medicine cabinets from drug ... interviews gives them the opportunity to get rid of those on what a drugs bring them to a national take back site and have those drugs are disposed of by law enforcement\nSo it is today it's from ten AM to two pm today and how many sites do you have her on the D.C Maryland Virginia area\nThe D.C Maryland Virginia we're about three hundred sites a and are working with about a hundred and eighty law enforcement partners\nScott somebody may say well wait a minute why don't I just flushing down the toilet\nTypically in the past people have flush their prescription drugs down the toilet that is the worst thing that could happen that only by doing that it creates an environmental hazard and also creates problems for the fish and wildlife that live downstream\nThose prescription drugs are than polluting the water system there by potentially polluting the fish and other things that live downstream\nSo you have three hundred locations open today between ten am in two PM and how do you find the location\nLocation if you go onto the take back dot com and put in your in your ZIP Code it'll tell you the locations that are near as your house\nThat da ... ZIP Code [noise]\nAgain today is national take back a day and it's part of the national take back initiative and you've been doing this for a long time\nThat is correct this program began in two thousand ten this is actually the sixteenth national kickback day it's held twice a year once in April at the end of April and once at the end of October today's program as the sixteenth national take back date it is held from ten AM to two PM [noise]\nThe previous Fifteen national take back days have been very successful the conjunction with the state and local and tribal unfortunate partners and that has removed a total of over nine\nPoint nine million pounds that's nearly five thousand tons of medication from the streets and in the local area of Virginia Maryland in D. C. [noise]\nThe last take back prop program in April removed almost forty four thousand pounds of unwanted unused prescriptions wow [noise] that's an amazing result\nThat is ... and the community if it continues to increase the community is becoming more and more aware of this program and the goal of it is said is to get the unwanted prescriptions off the out of the matter ... medicine cabinets\nI went back to go all the programs to get the news and wanted and needed to prescription pills out of the medicine cabinets and have them disposed of properly through law enforcement purposes so those pills do not end up in the wrong hands on the street\nSo if you have prescription medications that are in the medicine cabinet or anywhere around the house sitting there for a while you're not using them any longer don't flushing down the toilet don't throw 'em in the trash take them to one of\nThe d._a. take back locations and again it's da take back\nDot com just put your ZIP Code and you'll find any location very close to you here in the Washington area it is today from ten AM to two PM\nAnd tell us a little more about the resources you have because it's it's such a serious problem in in somebody listening is is may know someone that has an opioid problem and there are places to turn for help\n[noise] there are several places a turn for help theory has a lot of prevention and treatment facilities that you can contact\nTears also works with several websites to provide information not only to parents put two kids enter teachers about the dangers of drugs one of the Web sites is get smart about drugs dot com which is a perfect\nWebsite to educate the parents about the dangers of drugs another one for kids specifically has just think twice dot com it gives them information about drug abuse and the third one that did work with is called operation prevention dot com\nIt's actually a self contained learning module for parents in schools and it looks at the science of

effect of steroids because he was a body builder and some of the pictures or he was a very serious body builder to marry to a maybe too far extreme\nFaster and then so when you put that together with some level of political activism this guy was simply a wacko and um I think what we've seen so far regarding the uh the actual attempt\nWas that it was simply a hoax or early on in the investigation I was told that are within I think the first day that it would appear to be a a hoax at all these things were a had the appearance of explosive devices they really want explosive devices but I think that was a notable feature\nOf of what happened with this guy\n[laughter] so what you're saying and I guess it's it's kind of hard to have a definitive answer here but the question is did he intend for these pipe bombs to go off or did he intentionally build them so that they would not didn't they what can you tell\nI again some people I've spoken to actually examine them um I don't think they were ever decided to go off I think they had the features of bombs and I think we're going to learn more about all the materials but you know pipe bombs traditionally are made of metal PBC\nUm the broken glass and one of them are two of them was simply I think for a fact uh\nJust the parents of it and frankly no one has it not once I mean you can check the media is no one has ever talk about a detonator\nA you know I mean any ... guys and I tell you the detonator is the key to a device I I'm pretty sure they didn't have a detonator so\nLacking a detonator it ain't gonna explode I think that's where the whole thing tends to fall apart\n[noise] very interesting Sam I'm the investigation uh took him a couple of days but they were very confident from day one that they were going to apprehend to tell us a little bit about how they mailed them how they tracked him down\nThis guy really I think one of the get caught and that's the other feature here wreck I mean look at this guy is just from a central post office I'll give them that she did the timing of the event very well I mean these things started showing up kind of like clockwork\nSo it was very clear that it was a concerted effort and so I think once you understand there's a pattern you you you know better where to look\nAnd the postal service for any number of things that you know I I Do believe that got better I mean I look I got a great relationship with my local post office here in northern Virginia there are all great folks so I Do believe that um they're really the postal service has come a long way regarding tracking technology that sort\nOf thing so it was a I think it's just a matter of time in law enforcement again that that the folks I was talking to are very ... at this guy would not last long uh not being a trace town\nSo Tony we want to turn to the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal ... get a ... really dropped out of the spotlight of course when the attempted bombing took the headlines on but uh what do we know in terms of the latest on the investigation the country's attorney general in Saudi Arabia set on Thursday\nThat uh it was premeditated but a a who ordered it I mean where's the smoking gun or will there ever be a smoking gun as to who actually ordered ... to be taken out\nI think will that within a reasonable um a a a expectation of certain day and not too long and you know they've been incremental as President Trump said this was one of the most terrible cover ups ever\nA it was pretty obvious and I you know things like this governor and governments like that where you have essentially a small group of people running everything a judgment is this had to be approved at the very top and\nUm while the guy the very top may not have known details I think he issued like hey on this day go here and do this\nAnd um while the guy the very top may not have known details I think he issued like hey on this day go here and do this\nOr I'm very sure that the guy in charge had to know this was going to happen so there's going to be a certain level of I think I'm\nDistance between the guy was approved it and the actual event it doesn't change the fact that at some level which I Do believe it's going to go all the way the top which means you have to deal with this is a serious issue I mean simply put we cannot have countries which are even though\nYou know in our camp going around just killing journalists and it's a big issue and I think President Trump's as it was actually at diagnosing it and playing it very well he's been waiting for the ... waiting for things to come up before we start doing things in retaliation\nWant to turn to the caravan of migrants movie out towards California and interesting that uh they could take a shorter route to go to Texas but the laws are more lenient in California so here's the route will take them to California where do we\nWhat do you know what do we know about the caravan the origins that are not really being focused on in the mainstream media but\nTwo things which are notable the ice you take away from it is yeah this is a threat somewhat organizing assistant spontaneous uprising of citizens and think about this for yourself if you had a you know several thousand people walking across a say you know\nThe Fairfax County parkway you've noticed that and simply put you ... ... people kind of hanging out at night or without food logistics a toilet facilities all these things\nSo at this plant secondly this is a risk we go I was ... and ... and the curve and we don't know who's involved\nSo that the president is rightfully saying we cannot prevent this to happen so and plus\nJust the lawlessness habits so I think we we do see here that there is an organized effort and as you point out there are these people are ... smart enough to ... pointing towards California Texas or they would have a less ... less favorable chance of getting it\nAll right well President Trump has been very strong and put some significant pressure on Mexico and Central American countries in terms of ah possibly cutting off foreign aid\nYou've written an opinion piece at the hill dot com and it was published a couple of weeks ago but it's gotten six thousand shares so far down as the headline on at Trump shows peace\nThrough strength works after Obama Trump shows peace through strength works after Obama's strong headline and I I think we're seeing it I mean look what's happened with North Korea look what's happened with the the talks between Mexico and Canada on NAFTA and the you know the new trade deal [noise]\nI think that's been the key is that when President Trump says something he's not simply saying it for political points\nUm from what I've seen in a you know I sit on the sidelines and I see a lot of things and I get the tape touched different pieces of the bubble I'm not in the Bible but I could see it and overall you know what I'm saying the president's actually building a not only what he promised he do he's doing it in a way that's been very effective\nAnd you do have countries like Mexico taking notice when he says something\nOr in the past President Obama would say some something that people would automatically discount it because they would say is just political rhetoric don't worry about it that's not the case now\nSo in a situation like the care of that I think uh Mexico is going to cooperate for any number of reasons I think we have other nations now you know Saudi Arabia I I Would argue we would not know as much now about what happened in Saudi Arabia with the the the killing of the other media individual if it wasn't for the president because the Saudis would've blown us off\nSo I think it's the strength of the position of strength and then actually calling out the Russians of some of the things that are doing I think it's been very significant\nNow you point out in the article the contrast between President Obama's red line right was drawn over the Syrian use of chemical weapons and the Iranian nuclear deal and you you you contrast that\nForeign policy with the way the president has handled it um I I think people are waking up around the world and say whoa we can't play these guys anymore and\nI think this is we're you know there is a planned or some here with ... with Russia and as one of those issues for you know you might recall Rick uh this last week was the mouse we're walking away from the intermediate range thinking her forces the IMF treaty\nThat's because the Russians violated it so you know why would you maintain a treaty when the other side has walked away from it and I've seen all sorts of criticism about him potentially causing a nuclear arms race like pay the arms race started as long past\nThe point of our involvement it's time to get back in the game so that's what president trying to he's trying to get us back\nAt least ... ground you know to square one with the Russian and so
