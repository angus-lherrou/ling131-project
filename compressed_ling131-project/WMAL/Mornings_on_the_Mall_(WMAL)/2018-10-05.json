Believe I talked about my twenty eight year career as a lawyer almost all of which has been in public service I talked about my twelve years a judge on the U.S court of appeals for the district of

to know the answer to that to\nAnd I I I totally agree and I think that that's you know that's really what we should be I think if\nA if you look through a civil rights movement and it's unfortunate that the last has had the cognitive dissonance about this yeah um if you look to the civil rights movement you know what we're saying the reason that we need\nA criminal justice reform is that they're you know there have always been a faithful of the events of the process we do have a lot of people who have been exonerated by evidence later on whether it's\nYou know because somebody came forward

Republican women are overwhelmingly for Brett Kavanaugh so it's more of a partisan fight them been really a gender fight yes um\nAnd you also have I mean in the case that term for Democrats were already super charge to vote in the mid term elections\nBoth for Kavanaugh was nominated a ... you know Democrats had about twenty to twenty five on advantage with women voters so there's a real question of how much more they had to gain the sort of a law of diminishing returns\nEven when they have they have their own issue and are there are democratic women that I as you mentioned are very much part of the resistance very much a ... you know against Kavanaugh but\nRepublicans have more to gain you know they they were sort of added apathetic point before this fight began so Democrats were all already engaged they're they're already at a time you know they didn't really need a whole lot more momentum Republican either that extra juice\nAnd then you just what you make yesterday of Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota coming out and saying she was going to be a no vote this as she trails in that race by pretty meaningful margin it seemed to me that she was throwing in the towel on that race or am I getting that wrong\nYou know I wouldn't go that far but I think if you're a Democrat and you want to play pinball you while you know you don't want to upset Chuck Schumer you want to you want to cast a vote based on your principles\nAnd instead of being in a close race or down double digits as as two polls in the last week's show you're probably more likely to vote your conscience than you are to vote on politics\nAnd you know Democrats and Republicans alike I talked to think that Heidi Heitkamp is really serious trouble to to to win a second term she's definitely the most vulnerable a democratic senator on a ballot and you also see Doug Jones is another good example of this phenomenon is about a twenty twenty the Alabama Democrat but she\nDoes it I think he's so pessimistic that he'll win another term in Alabama that he's that much more partisan he's been much more of a of a reliable vote for Chuck Schumer\nSpeaking of of of Democrats who are voting to say you know we saw Bob Menendez come out and say that you know he he was he was going to vote against\nDead and Brett Kavanaugh and and we had a conversation about this because you know I find it interesting because for the first time bomb and damned is is in a neck and neck with a Republican challenger\nSo he's coming off of these allegations of corruption and and this this laughable\nHearing this that he had this laughable trial that he had a I was so shocked to hear him come out and say that because you would think that he would be hedging his bets and just not saying anything is there any kind of serious challenge to him or is he gonna pull this out\nWell I I think he's still favored he has a very a well regarded Republican challenger hug him who spending a lot of money over them but I Do think the politics in New Jersey may play I mean I think there's a reason why not as it's been a little more outspoken against capping off because if you look at sort of the suburban women in New Jersey I I think they're much more anti cat\nWith all the way are pro so as you have a low favorability ratings have ethical issues that you have to overcome I mean the best way of urban Mendez to kind of rally his reelection rally supporters his reelection he's the one person is is to vote against God but also I I I think that makes it a little bit of vets for his his political future\nAs it did you as you're watching sort of the Senate battle I don't know if you have a sense of the Web count hearing I Know everyone's trying to figure it out to overcome the cabinet vote\nI'm Steve Danes

or early Sunday Morning and it gets back from a wedding in time and I don't know what I'm hearing if you may have one ... you may you may have someone like Lisa Murkowski and she's a she's the least likely support her have it on in that Republican coffee\nSusan Collins wants to get some evidence she said\nShe'd support and calving off Jeff Flake after seeing the FBI report seemed to publicly say he he he supported Kavanaugh Murkowski is the one Republican senator who sort of wavered in all of her public say yeah and I think if there's one person who who doesn't vote per capita and that means

three forty five fifty seven or go to select code dot com and since Nineteen eighty five we shop you save\nI don't want to have to get a real job senator to\nShow what happens what happens over the next twenty four hours you we get we got the culture mode of this morning and then tomorrow we're expecting the actual vote well first let me pause in the country for a second and no way to say that as we watched the cloture vote today\nWill this be in Europe buys the the biggest indicator of how the ... the Senate's going to vote tomorrow when it actually matters\nIt didn't used to be that way what happened in the past as many times that we have senators vote to shut down debate because he needed sixty votes and then they would vote against the nomination so you had votes splitting and that was a good way for senators to kind of have to be on both sides keep their feet in both sides of this debate\nOn you might have seen that this time you know have there been a sixty row threshold you may have had a lot of Democrats voting shut down debate in voting no but that that's gone so what happens now is have the vote today\nThe votes a simple majority vote to shut down debate but you still have more debate the thirty more hours\nWere senators can come down to debate each senators a lot of debate for one hour um so you may see a a stream of Democratic senators coming down to kind of chew up that time but after thirty hours is a lapse didn't have the real vote you have the vote on the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh\nLet me add that the optics though of a stream of Democratic senators coming down and basically just having a public temper tantrum over over the Brett Kavanaugh's\nConfirmation which which we know what's going to go to a vote for that to just eating a time just that just just hurt them more in the mid term so maybe they won't do that because maybe they realized that this could backfire on them\nAnd I I think you are going to have Democrats come down because so many of them seem to be running for president right from the Senate you've got a Kamala Harris of California Cory Booker of New Jersey or ... or no man for two said\nAmy club which are of Minnesota I mean you have so many senators teamed up their run for president and that more so they care more so about running for president then the winning the midterms in and making a play for the midterms\nInteresting okay so ... so you're saying it's thirty more hours of debate does it have to be literal debate on the floor or does that mean we will always see a senator at the microphone for the next thirty hours beginning at ten thirty\nYou would have thought so but you don't have to I mean what basically happened to sender comes down gives their fee for an hour and then there's usually a quorum call because there's nobody there but you know this is one of those issues that uh is is very high profile so I think you will see an organized effort by Democrats the message\nOf their speaking right to their base and they think this helps some in some senses in the mid term just because it gets their base organized and and and really active but it appears that they overplay their hand and they've actually done\nA great get out the voter yeah many Republican and that is true so at this begins that's already our process is we are talking about that means from ten thirty ... thirty hours from now than will be five thirty in the afternoon tomorrow that's and that's and that's when we're expecting that this final vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh will take place correct\nYeah and there is one complicating factor is the fact that Steve Gaines daughter is getting married yet as he said he will not be around for for the vote so I don't know how that plays out I mean ultimately it's possible that you could have um a vote or re vote at some point in the future if\nUh you know Steve Gaines of deciding vote but I don't think anybody really thinks if there's going to be a one vote that's going to ... and make the decision here I mean ultimately\nYou're probably going to have the party's stick together with Joe Manchin may be voting in favor which gives you fifty two votes and then Steve Gaines can't make it then you only have fifty weren't\nVery quickly uh Brian is is it is there's no way that that Steve Gaines can just just to get his vote electronically he can't face time I mean it just seems ridiculous in this day and age ... he has to fly back and he just can't get on face time or Skype or something and give his that gives up\nWhere you have to be there in person and back when the Senate actually was cordial and they all got together got along what would happen is huge habits senator say look I Know that Steve Gaines a Democrat would say look I Know see things can't be here he would vote yes I was planning on\nVoting no repair my vote and just not vote could do was put in the record you know that vote\nYou imagine a while but we don't have a cordial Senate anymore now Bryan darling thank you for being cordial explaining to us this morning Vancouver tiny forty four W male attention investors each
