they can identify that way so here's what's at the core of it this is a New York times report\nAbout what the Trump Administration is up to\nA and here's the real headline here on the transgender could be defined out of existence under the Trump Administration\nUm that at the gate is not precisely true I mean I don't think anybody saying you can't call yourself whatever you'd like to call yourself\nOr consider yourself whatever you'd like to consider yourself nobody's saying that ... but what is apparently being said the Trump Administration according to the times is considering quote narrowly defining gender as a biological\nImmutable condition determined by genitalia at birth and this is what the times called quote the most drastic move yet in a government wide effort to roll back recognition and protections of transgender people under federal civil rights law\nBy the time goes on to point out that the Obama administration made a series of decisions that loosening the legal concept of gender and federal programs including an education and health care\nAnd they recognize gender largely as an individual choice and not determined by the sex assigned at birth the policy prompted fights over the following bathrooms dormitories single sex programs and other arenas where gender was once seen as a simple concept\nOr the times claims that conservatives especially evangelical Christians were incensed so ha chess that's the department of health and Human Services is now I'm trying to push for this effort the times reports\nTo establish a legal definition of sex for the entire government under title nine\nOr which is that federal civil rights law that bans gender discrimination and education\nAnd um this is according to a memo that the times obtained\nAnd they're looking to get a couple of other agencies involved they argued that key government agencies need to adopt and explicit in uniform definition of gender is determined quote on a biological basis that it's clear grounded in science objective at administrative will\nAdminister ... rather [laughter] um [noise]\nSo this is\nThis seems like it makes a tremendous amount of sense actually I mean if there's going to be government programs that are based on what your sex is would it not make sense for the government to have a clear definition of what sex is right\nRight well see this is the thing and and now that we were talking about this in our in our present meeting and as you explain that now we get more into it\nI I'm super supportive of whatever you want to do like this is where the

Thirteen year old boy\nYou shouldn't have the right to just go in to the girls locker room that's not fair to the girls there like you are right doesn't supersede they're right\nAnd this is where I think we need to just say that when it comes to science because remember we're all about science right because Republicans are science deniers so as here here comes science or is that right well I'm bored with the science thing\nYou've got an X. Y. or an ex sex and that's the science of this\nNow as an adult if you choose to to be otherwise that's fine but I think this comes into play with with competing in sports we have women losing out to men because they have more testosterone so it's not competing against a woman just because he dresses on doesn't make it so well I'll tell you the\nThe thing one of the things really stands out about all this is the kind of the tendency among cultural liberals to basically say anything that change under the Obama administration\nIs something they they treat it as if it's a thousand year old tradition [laughter] right right as if it didn't change like yesterday yeah so the government changes its definitions of gender like yesterday and now the Trump measures and you know what that was the wrong decision and we should be very clear in this case scientific about what it what gender means\nYou know what men and women are because it has long deep lasting ramifications for the way the government administers the very programs that are aimed at people based on that very category\nSo the administration reportedly taking a look at making this a very clear definition and there's plenty of liberal so good the pages of the New York times very upset about this this morning five forty\nTaking a look at making this a very clear definition and there's plenty of liberal so good the pages of the New York times very upset about this this morning [noise] five forty four W male\nOne eight hundred God junk can always get there quicker because we've got more drugs more\nAnd better systems one eight hundred guy John ... the original in World War just service junk removal company\nMeans all you have to do\nHardworking heroes we make problems\nYou're going to love these heroes\nI Love working here we drink clean shiny try and we're\nNot be happy uniforms because we're proud of what we do point it's something that's in the way [noise] gone pointed something awkward and ugly on point I'm an old sofa doubt hide a bed a pile of trash [noise] gone gone gone gone\nWork until midnight seven days a week do you call it a hundred guys young form of that\nOne eight hundred got John dot com\nWhite ruled brutalized law enforcement officers\nThese are the victims of illegal immigration American Life destroy our broken immigration law\nAnd conservative congressman Kevin McCarthy is leading the blind\nExpands Walter ... women\nAmerican citizens have the right\nThe leadership of President Trump's new\nKevin McCarthy is bill\nAnd didn't force the law ...\nForties [noise]\nLike forty five times for WMA all traffic and whether every ten minutes and first on the ... to get you to work at least debate and in the deep carpet cleaning Catholics center\nIn a bomb because sixty six has the crashing than an exit number fifty three which is twenty eight Centerville it is currently in the right lane sterling accident he found seven at city center boulevard lurking crashed cleanup is among Fairfax County parkway north at telegraph rolled in northwest D.C fourteenth street is\nClose now in both directions between B. cannon street and Allison straight for an accident if you take metro rail\nAnd red lines separate issues make sure you check ahead now from garage door repair dot com that WMA all weather Channel's forecast\nGenerally boring one of the cold air morning so far this whole\nArea [noise] plenty of people died today how close I mean you're all just raised it you're from the weather channel on\nCurrently in our nation's capital thirty nine degrees by forty seven and a male [noise]\nI got\nDog and I go to that but I guess\nIt was just in the music hall of fame you know\nMess for whatever hall of fame would address us I don't think the rock and Roll Hall of fame is right for the\n... it's the new Canadian National anthem I Can't believe you knocked it [laughter]\nUh Canada legalizing marijuana for recreational use on Wednesday big day in Canada ... such a huge day and Canadians were so excited about this\nThere the verge of running out the entire country of Canada huge country on the verge of running out of cannabis no candidates real they're buying how to do much pot in Canada right now mhm they are ...

correspondence the Daily Caller I'm gone it wants to marry well\nMorning alright Kamala Harris clearly are trying to uh per game in a bid to run in twenty twenty against President Trump\nAnd Xi bloated an idea [noise] she she\nSaid uh twenty Seventeen survey from the website bank rate dot com\nAnd that survey found that more than half of Americans cannot afford a five hundred dollar unexpected expense like a wrench increase in medical bill or childcare\nAmericans are not safer as we know this we are not sabers I don't know why we're not savers but we are not savers we figure oh did I don't have to save for retirement because I retired I'm going to live on Social Security all my medical bills are going to be paid through Medicare that's pretty much not how it works but that's how we wander through life we don't save\nSo she's got a solution she has a solution for us [noise] she is proposing that families who make less than a hundred thousand dollars a year now families I guess means a married couple and then with children or whatever I don't I'm not quite sure what is defined as a family mhm\nMaking less than a hundred thousand dollars a year we'd get a monthly tax credit up to five hundred dollars or six thousand dollars a year\nIndividuals making less than fifty thousand would be eligible for up to two fifty a year or three ... two fifty a month\nAs in dollars a year\nIndividuals making less than fifty thousand would be eligible for up to two fifty a year or three thousand two fifty a month or three thousand\nA year and she said look Americans are working harder than ever but stagnant wages means they cannot keep up with cost of living increases so this would basically be a cola a cost of living adjustment that the government is going to provide you know they're not handing you cash they're giving you\nA tax credit and her idea then is that you know this this would be great because then you would be able to afford a Knicks unexpected expenses and things like that\nNormally in a progressive income tax structure which we have in the United states it doesn't matter if you're more money you don't actually lose out your the money is all taxed at the same rate in the smaller bracket right that's how it works but\nWith income tax credits when you move up past the the qualifying area then you do lose out on my right from the government\nOn the other hand do you think people are smart enough to figure that out\nYeah I Do I Do and I you know and you know what and you know what I think happens is those people are smart enough make\nDecisions that aren't good for the economy they end up sitting back and holding on in order to do the thing that's best for them and that makes sense\nYou say people are smart enough but yet I Know some really smart people who when you talk about getting rid of all deductions those are the ones who escaped not my child care tax credit I have three children I'm not going to lose that money like dummy you'll have more money in the end in your paycheck in the because of all these other things about well they're not you'll be paying at a lower rate but\nThat's the difference would be not understanding policy but all ... and also just being understanding self interest I mean I've known people who are basically stayed on unemployment as long as they could buy stretching out part time work things like that\nBecause they they felt that they were getting a better deal they're pursuing full time employment people act out of self interest and if the tax code incentivized negative behavior sometimes people will take it up\nYeah Ken Sterling Virginia can't good morning Iran mornings on them Oh hi\nYes good morning\nWe need to address the situation of education first and foremost yes\nIf you look at people that win the lottery three to five years later they actually have luck I started with because they don't have the physical discipline I actually had a Web site at critical enterprise top people don't ... percent interest credit cards and I called my friend\nAnd she said it wouldn't work for her because she knew she didn't have the discipline to respect that the credit card companies money was not present should go ahead and spend it\nSo if you just get additional capital all you're doing is decreasing somebody budget and spent that and then so\nYeah that's so true and and that's that's for that I immediately son is thank you can then I immediately sign Kamala Harris is thinking is that you know because of this study that came out that most Americans don't say we can't afford five hundred dollars in an unexpected expense they don't have that put away\nAnd and it goes to to learning and finances and being taught about finances and\n... and I'm Sorry this is the school's job this is this is parents need to to to start teaching their kids to be financially respond\nBut the government's not better at this individuals are better at the government look loses all of a Social

of wiggled his hand the suburbs wiggling is not good unless you're a Redskin and the cowboys were during the regular\nYes well that's worked it worked out nicely there what\nAbout injuries and how how we're we're the we're the cowboys hampered by injuries and where are the Redskins now when it comes on who did not start that we thought we're ... we're going to I any surprises\nWell the cowboys have been hampered by injuries and my response to that is when and where where\nTheir outfits of wind has struggled with that they're starting center has illness so they're ... they're they've had a problem it left tackle with injury\nWhere where where the Redskins are are playing backup said et cetera and left guard right now [noise] Trent Williams had surgery on his me a couple of weeks ago the left tackle the receiving corps is decimated with injuries are the running back is unrecognizable as a group because of injury so yeah the cowboys had a few injuries\nI'm going to say is gloating is not pretty well I'll tell you it's certainly worth it this morning on the cowboys grow to use ... an hour\nOr so ... you know among the other big things that happened yesterday the Redskins scoring a defensive touchdown precedent Smith picking up on us I I ... and going into the end zone instantly wanted turnaround moment for the red skins as they maintain a nicely and at that point\nThat was the game winter the risk is one that won the game by three and the defense gave him seven points right there what happened was the cowboys were backed off a writing their own goal I don't like on the one oh back to ... add\nThat Prescott went back to pass writing Kerrigan was buying him in other words he didn't rush initially he was making sure that Prescott wouldn't run\nAnd when he saw that there was no one of the block and if he rushed instead of just standing there watching the play yes Kerrigan decided to fire\nAnd so he did rush he's the one that strip the ball out of caused a fumble press dismissal standing there the ball sitting on the ground so we decided to pick it up and take one step as he gets all the credit for the the best out of the focus group a score as writers credit he made that play but it really is carrying his trial because of how he managed that play\nAnd it was interesting is when he didn't have a problem with the fence or off and you know the ... the defense\nI guide for three ... they got some turnover is the author didn't get the ball away it's like everything finally has finally yelled\nAnd come together and you look at this you know like wow this is like a really promising season that the Redskins are going to happier if they can keep the momentum and keep everything yelling the way it seemed to come together during this game I mean this is going to be a fantastic here\nIt has the ability to do that especially since the rest of the division seems to not have risen like we thought they might be a big game will struggling but the the office\nWith the injuries that they've had literally the running backs and wide receivers are completely unrecognizable for what we expected them to be in some ways because of injury as we started the season this office didn't turn the ball over though you're right and that really was the key for them yeah passing game still struggle that needs to get better chemistry\nI Want to ask you about that because Jeremy Sprinkle was wide open I think on the in the flat in the end zone to like ... cents I'm playing the game and the ball just completely missed him I mean it was like Alex Smith and German sprinkle for some reason just were not in the same page what's going on there\nI was with red rose to the right Germany sprinkle was parallel to hit running from left or right at the end zone sprinkle how to step on his guy and Alex basically through it too far out in front of them out Smith today like last week is chemistry just wasn't there\nA he he works hard I it's hard for me to fault him but he he didn't have as best game of the ... you know you miss him open receivers last week and this week and that's not expected from him\nHe he didn't have as best game and I don't really miss him open receivers last week and this week and that's not expected from him I Do expect him to get better at that\nPart of it is because he's working with different receivers all the time but he didn't have a nice connection with with Jordan read cut it down a few of those Fifteen to twenty yard passers and that will be important going forward\nYeah well that's going to take the giants next week one

I Believe they were within the margin of error close to them and then does once you exactly and that's why I I Know some people who are like is he going to come\nTo New Jersey so it'd be interesting to see if he does something like that but I have to say I think that that Ted Cruz getting this injection of of a doozy as him ... obviously doesn't hurt plus you've got ... being sued for these text messages unsolicited text messages\nOr that he's now he's dealing with that as well so he's got some problems on his hands that are that are coming up and starting to really rare they're ugly heads forbade or\nInto really weird they're ugly heads for me to Iraq\nSo you know I I think if you put her up against like a Kamala Harris and that kind of thing I think Hillary has got a good shot the problem is that she's got stopped falling\nThat would be number one she's gotta stop choking on there because there is a lot of concerns about her health problems but I Do think she can out fundraising anybody else in the Democrats put\nOut she's staying visible in case you're wondering about the age of she's a year younger than Trump\nA and maybe she sees that as well you know this is my shot if you've been around for a second term why don't I run for re attempt at as presidents they sang um she's in again she's insisted that she doesn't want to\n'em but here she is potentially trying again at least in the eyes of fully brains humid this may just be wishful thinking I mean there's a whole bunch of Hillary people\nIn town who do not know what to do but we brains is one of them they literally thought the world was going to be there's there'll be the oyster Hillary lost and the Democratic establishment and do you see just got completely washed out\nBy a red wave mhm Trump comes into office and they were like well wait a second my future is not secure anymore so fully brains may be planning for the good old days you're or he's giving us a real indicator that Hillary Clinton could make another run for president\nBut either way there are a lot of people who are probably hunting for the good old days who want to see the Clintons come back there are a lot of people who want to see Hillary vindicated look at the people on the streets were having public temper tantrums in restaurants all over the place why because Hillary Clinton\nLast time the only way to

program on friday I listen to what he's up\nToo much political correct no well I think there is too much political correctness in this country but I think health care is far and away the dominant issue and there's a lot of political correctness on both sides on all the time\nWhat well how am I mean what\nChuck Schumer is coming out against political correctness he says there's way too much of it\nGoing on in the United states and this follows on the heels of that survey that there's been getting or at least we talked about it extensively that some eighty percent of Americans said political correctness is a problem and that cuts across genders that cuts across races across got political parties\nOnly eight percent of the country even considers himself a liberal political activist of any kind like\nAn intense right liberal ideologue everybody else was like man it's getting crazy out there\nWell maybe\nCould they possibly be coming full circle\nCould they possibly be saying ... who you're talking about left we might have taken this thing just been too poor people have been saying for a long time that people in the right in the same to overplay their hand a political correctness and this is going to be a loser and with that poll that came out with about two weeks ago yeah so the only eighty percent of Americans hate political correctness\nSo maybe the Democrats unfortunately are starting to wake up and go and how we might not ... on a rain this in a little bit\nBut you look at those numbers and they're like oh that is why Trump won that exactly a twenty two and W A L
