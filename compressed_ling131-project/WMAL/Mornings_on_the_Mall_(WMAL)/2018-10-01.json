open so that no the cats fell over everything was fine are good but I needed a break I needed a mental health breaking so Saturday I just had to unplug\nFriday though but I think this is what pushed me over the edge was the president agreed\nTo an FBI investigation we know that Jeff Flake or was pressured by the Democrats to to hold out\nAnd uh order an FBI you know for an FBI investigation he and Jeff Flake acquiesced and flakes lake and so the president on friday ordered the FBI to open a coup supplemental investigation into Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd that means that you will have a more statements from her to compare and more ... she's either going to be consistent with one of her testimony in the Senate or her prior her prior explanations in the press and in the letters that she sent\nA so this is just you know no matter how the FBI handles is just so long as they faithfully transcribe their interactions I think you're going to get an even clear picture of why destroyed doesn't exactly work out from his forward\n[noise]\nI I agree with you I think is but but to to everyone's points so far I think that there is that that that feeling right now until we see the report that I don't think it's going to be fair that's how much mistrust there has been fostered within the FBI right now\nYou know and I think that the I think that's a problem yeah eight eight eight\nSix three zero nine six two five Roger and Winchester can morning Roger you're on mornings on them all\nGood morning Mary events thanks for taking my call but I just bought Jeff Flake statement after the vote and he said let the F ... and you and then he said do an investigation that Democrats are going to be out already out begin with\n...\nWell yeah I I did I read an investigation of some kind or during this process because they ... they were involved in some in a background check they done six background checks already Brett Kavanaugh so this'll be the seventh\nUh opening that they've made a in all of this show so you're so you're right in one way Roger we know for sure that the FBI has investigated Brett Kavanaugh in the past including for or his\nUh his security clearance the highest levels of government within the White House get access to the nuclear codes there is no way they didn't do a highly invasive and personal background check on this guy in the past\nAnd in all of those the fact that he ran a gang rape bring the never came up you know so that it seems cruel and seems like kind of something that's important to come up in an investigation like that but it didn't so here they are investigating yet again\n[noise] yeah I I I agree with everything Vincent said boy it's one of those days and I are agreeing Ronald in Silver Spring Ronald good morning here I'm warnings on them all\nWomen I don't I don't trust the ab ab and drop as well make a political down down to look at it that the Monet then sworn in Congress are they not Iraq sweat next allegations\nAre they going to tell them not to look at whether he was a heavy drinker locked out and I think it won't be medical and they're not going to do too\nWell in other words Ronald you don't trust President Trump is not that you don't trust the FBI you don't trust the president because you're ... your your point is I don't ... he's instructing them to not look into certain things that's a different question whether or not you trust the president here\nRight so I don't trust that they're going to war in Iraq and I don't trust that this is the leading investigation about after yeah because we are not want to know that going on\nI really\nI Know well we already see what happens with that parameters though and that's the ... investigation ... than the things that don't have anything to do with the questions at hand which is is Brett Kavanaugh sexual abuse or of any kind of those are the things that get explored and that's not what we need so the fact that their guard rails on the investigation I think that makes sense [noise]\nWell and here's the thing no one's asking her about her drinking or whether she lucked out a lot maybe it's her memory we only asked him whether he likes that and even the Democrats didn't ask for an investigation\nInto sweat neck um they they're even the the Democrats are saying yeah this is when we need to look into their ...

sixteenth Washington Post article said it happened to quote the summer of Nineteen eighty to\nThat same September sixteenth article reported the notes from an individual therapy session and twenty Thirteen showed her describing the assault is occurring in her quote late teens\nBut the post on the committee she told the post and the company that she was Fifteen when the alleged assault occurred so that would not be late teens that would be squarely in the mid teens Fifteen\nUm she has not turned over her therapy records so in other words\nWords the dates have been all over the place when the when the alleged assault occurred uh and uh you have the prosecutor here sensing a pretty meaningful inconsistency\nEl ... and this is just the beginning I mean how many of us and listen to the day after friday morning then we we had both taking notes and during during the hearings I Know at least I didn't end there were a whole list of her inconsistencies because I found myself again I listen to her as watched his I wanted to do both\nAnd and as I was listening I was like wait a minute wait a minute that's not what you said before ... ... and it's so to me if they were very easy her

air being the restrictions and the district to a vote on that at eight Fifteen former FBI official one hot do is with us and his take on the investigation today a thirty five other behind salon is with us on why we must do a\nVery well to her was in the morning the FBI in the midst of conducting\nYet it's seventh investigation into Brett Kavanaugh in his life this after Democrats for weeks were demanding lawn including asking Kavanaugh to call for one during the hearing on Thursday Kavanaugh of course expressed a willingness to have\nThis if this whole process satisfied by whatever investigation is necessary in order for that for him declare his name saying he's a good man\nSenator Mazie Hirono was on ABC's This week this week and she said the FBI's uh now that the FBI is doing an investigation the fact that it has constraints\nIs a farce she says senator Amy ... the Minnesota Democrat she said this you can't interview this person you can't look at this time period you can only look at these people from one side the street from when they were growing up I mean come on\nThis was her on CNN's State of the union in other words\nDemocrats not that they have their FBI investigation are furious that it has constraints because the White House of course said yeah look into the allegations by Dr positive for look into the allegations by Deborah Ramirez speak to the witnesses that they have claimed to have\nOn the FBI investigation into these claims but they are opposed to what they call quote a fishing expedition that could take a broader look at Kavanaugh's credibility and behavior in other words the president and he said this weekend he's not limiting these guys they can look into whatever they want but he did give them a scope of what he expects them to look into\nSo the Democrats all in this case ... protest too much\nIs there a point at which they're satisfied by this process cells go to Ross and only this morning Ross morning stir\nFry or do no matter what\nThe only thing that they're worried about is Rosie weighed and whatever investigation whatever findings they will not be satisfied because they think they're worried that he as as they will person will be able to change Robie way that that's really the only issue in my opinion\nIs just as an existential threat to their politics not is not about his character is not about his credibility is not about whether or not he's a good person or whether these telling the truth or whether there's actually occurred it's about power\nUh and that's and that's at the center of it unfortunately let's go to John in Alexandria destroying John good morning sir\nMartin I like to turn your question around a little bit and have somebody asked members of on the Democratic side of the committee asked will they turn their vote around if you have to be our report completely exonerate yeah\nGreat question would that satisfy you to the point that you that you would vote for him\nNow we should point out before even before the allegations surfaced in public half the Senate Judiciary committee Democrats and already said they're voting against the guy [laughter] so that was that was just based on the fact that they didn't like him to begin with and they didn't like his judicial temperament or whatever I mean the point is is it at its core you know what it's about it's about the power play\nBut um so that's unlikely although\nThe question really should be extent that question in particular should be extended to the red state Democrats who have who have been question marks in the process right the the Heidi Heitkamp the Joe Donnelly is the Joe mansions you know who are who are they going to vote for and will they be satisfied by this process\n[noise] I think boy I feel sorry for them because they have so much pressure on them right now you know they have a ton of pressure on them right now from their own party in order to vote a specific way because in the end their party doesn't really care I don't think if they get reelected\nHere but they ... they do and that's why that's why you saw a mansion flakes Collins Murkowski they were the ones huddling together on Thursday night trying to figure out which direction their votes for going and then went flake said he was going to be a yes vote all of a sudden it seemed like the floodgates were opening and then you'd have red state Democrats all sort of swinging in at the same time\nThey're waiting on the Republican votes here\nSo this is going to be a ... office is going to be a long week Mary friday can

sounds sounds unlikely but\nWhat do you think bill in Fredericksburg just want to feel good morning sir I\nWant to know the answer is no and it really doesn't have anything to do a road where it it has to do with just a dark global agenda or the Democrats want to destroy the American economy and turn America into the country they don't want that what Bill by Republican and they won't be happy until a Democrat get that they need\nOr crack at it so they need to just stand down and accept\nThe fact that care when I was going to be put on the Supreme Court\nYes and it's it's so so roe v Wade

quote unquote demands yes I think was demand things they never asked a different place than manned just demand them\nAnd they were demanding that the president raised the cap on refugees five times

investigation can you believe it can you believe it I Know you can marry I can that's why bleach my floor patterns like Sony not\nTo make him say yeah but I'm I'm for the FBI investigation my vote is contingent upon the FBI investigation\nWell here's what happened to Jeff Flake he gets in a building I guess and it gets in an elevator in the Senate office building on his way to the vote on whether to recommend Kavanaugh and he's confronted by this\nMain\nAnyone in your telling all when\nThey don't matter that they should just stay quiet because what happens when you're doing you know what happened to me and that's where you're coming don't matter they should get down there is no way\nYou're telling me what you're telling me that my\n\nNow instead of saying well you know we have a presumption of innocence in this country until proven guilty ... there are no there were no um ... there's no proof\nThat he's done anything wrong just like just sat there was really quiet while the woman that woman is Anna\nAnna Maria or ... she's the co executive director of the center for popular democracy action uh-huh and somehow she wound up in the elevator with Jeff Flake and I'm watching this thinking to myself because\nBecause I Know we have to be in the office of the Senate office building you need security how did she get in there well number one how does she get into the elevator with Jeff Flake it well it's not hard\nI mean you can get in one of the great things about America that you can get access to your senators really easily go through a metal detector to go into the Senate office buildings and you're there and so she gets she gets into the elevator was blocking the doors was his members only ... this is our understanding okay it was okay so it was a members only older she was\nBlocking the door and by the way it's it's already [laughter] for me it's uncomfortable being in an elevator with somebody who isn't talking she's screaming her head off at this guy\nWell that's the thing she's she's someone said to her get out of the elevator she said I'm having a discussion and I'm thinking to myself no you're not you are just screaming at somebody and what's interesting is she wrote a piece\nAbout why she did what she did and she uses the word I was in rage and then I woke up in rage and I found that so interesting because the left is often enraged and they're often in rage and feel it raging yes but yet they were upset with Brett Kavanaugh's tone yesterday words\nDidn't like how emotional he got out on me I I just I Want to address something she said on the elevator this should that he's sending a message to all women\nThat's not what this is about it doesn't have anything to do like there's something there's a pernicious force in politics which is to universal lives every experience as I being involved with every single person in some sort of identity politics group has nothing to do with that it actually is about one woman\nIt's about one woman and one man and one woman's accusations and one man's defense thought about you it's not about every other woman in America it's not about women in the world it's about Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nAnd judge Brett Kavanaugh those are the two people who are involved in this allegation and the statement he's making says something about what you said Mary whether or not he gives the presumption of innocence to Brett Kavanaugh or not because that's how we ... that's how we we we handle these cases in America but for her it's about\nIdentity politics\nRight and and ... and listened she's she said she suffered abuse she was five years old and I feel for her but that doesn't mean that every woman who claims she has been abused is telling the truth or is remembering it correctly\nSo I I the whole thing bother me but she wrote a piece about this and and that's what happened that's what turned Jeff Flake to say I'll do this but I Want the one week FBI investigation

out um is saying you know he was very disappointed and he was shocked by the whole thing and there was a lot of people there was always that\nArab out that this was political that this was done for political reasons that's why why this and because his character is more of a conservative character\nBut he is not super preachy it's not like some of these TV shows they preach liberal politics and they talk about Trump and this and that and everything else that was the last man standing was there was about a family were dad was kind of like more of an a conservative view and he takes\nA bunch of like cheesy shot that Hillary Clinton I mean that's like that was the the sum total of how political this thing was he would bust on Hillary I mean and it was it was so over the top and she was like I don't know it's like almost cringe worthy occasionally but it was a funny show and the ratings were really good friend and I said but the cancer it anyway right well\nAccording to the Hollywood Reporter ratings were even better\nEven better friday night on Fox away they debuted their seventh season they brought in one point at one point eight rating among adults aged Eighteen to forty nine\nThat's a little bit more than eight million viewers higher than their final season on ABC which average a one point to as opposed to a one point eight and brought in six point four million viewers on the same day ratings wow yeah so did really well did you watch it\nNo I didn't but good for Tim Allen I think that's great but they were able to do that I mean you got to wonder if the if it's just because it was a premier on Fox and it was so dramatic that they had moved everything from ABC to Fox\nThat maybe just maybe you know the ratings are high for that reason now let's see if they have staying power\nRight now I did not um we did not watch it but we did recorded\nSome will say we went and the funny thing is as we did not watch last man standing when it was around before

the fuss is about we're going to watch it you know we did\nWe used to watch the um the ABC version\nOf because we we have the TV on we were watching local stuff and then it would end up kind of

giving a conditional yes spoke to the Senate Judiciary committee saying yes she's voting for Brett Kavanaugh but he'd like to see one week FBI investigation which the president has ordered to be done to begin there in the process of doing it what do you make of the FBI looking into Brett Kavanaugh now\nWell they're doing what they've been asked to do president did the right thing which was to authorize it uh the fascinating part of it is that Chris Coons a Democrat from Delaware who apparently is the\nMain squeeze the Senator Flake adds that the investigation before one week now let's remember now it was Chris Coons a Democrat from Delaware said one week plead all of a sudden over the weekend diet\nDianne Feinstein and others that one week is not enough what you were watching is a disgraceful for performance by shameless Democrats who want one thing and that is the leg\nOr they have won a temporary delay with this in order to get Jeff Flake whether or not flake will ever vote for Kavanaugh is an open question he is obviously\nJustice traumatized as Christine Blasey Ford flake look like her put a wig on him and you've got forward all over again the man has no spy no backbone but you had to give in to him in order to get this done\nOr the Democrats went the way they got it but there will be a vote either at the end of this week or next weekend and it will be up or down and if Kavanaugh is not confirmed his not confirmed every Republican who voted against him will be primary in their next election\nJoe the question we asked this morning two of the listeners and we ask them do you trust the FBI to conduct a fair investigation we have I don't think we had one listener who said yes nobody trusts the FBI or we should we trust them\nOnly me ask you about Rod Rosenstein he's agreed to meet with House Republicans now this week to explain that report that he allegedly according to New York times suggested secretly recording President Trump's veal wire and also a raised invoking the twenty Fifth Amendment to have President Trump removed from office what do you make of this meeting all I\nCan assure you what happened or even though McCabe ... ball or his memos for the record everybody had possession of they all knew this existed that they've done everything they could to keep this from the house and Senate\nSo that route Rosenstein would have to respond of course Rosenstein said these words and this nonsense that when he said it was the joke\nIs that that's a firing offense to be joking about the twenty fifth in them and given the circumstances of this presidency and what the Democrats have tried to do for it but make no mistake about a Rod Rosenstein is a creek [noise]\nHe is a dishonest fundamentally dishonest he cares about one thing himself his next job and his future\nI'm the president of course we'll keep him\nThrough the next through the election cycle taping him after that is an open question do you want to fire him and get rid of him and start all over again do you want to leave him there so you can can you can force him to be fundamentally approaching honesty because at that\nPoint you have somebody that that evil at the core of the Justice Department you can have no system that functions well I can assure you that the people in that building are in shock at the way he has managed things\nAnd when you look at it just to think about this for a second we're talking about the deputy attorney general where is Jeff Sessions he's on a milk carton this guy is so sad and so depressing\nTo watch him twist in the breeze as an incompetent attorney general and and they're behind him is rats Butte and Rod Rosenstein this is an ugly period for the department and it will not get better until both of them are gone\nAnd lastly Joe on the house intel voted to release the transcripts from the Russian investigation for more than fifty witnesses including Obama Clinton aids fusion GPS Loretta Lynch Susan Rice you name it so it goes to the intel community next is do we see any of this before the midterms\nI doubt it I doubt it I think the scrubbing which will go on with the intelligence community will take a considerable period of time some some of that will be for a purpose for the lay\nSome of that will be for legitimate reasons but it doesn't matter the ... the dire cast I mean everybody knows what happens here and it may you know I started talking about this to our listeners two years ago there was a brazen plot\nTo exonerate Hillary Clinton and if she lost to frame Donald Trump every single piece of publicly available evidence has confirmed that and the only people who don't believe that\nAre the ten Democrats on that committee up on the hill all the Democrats in the house and Senate and James Comey who is a very very sick man [noise]\nWell I think I think I think people want to see some justice and they want to see this done even for even though we all believe this now I still think there are a lot of people who want to see this in black and white and have their crimes laid bare and hopefully that will happen\nIndeed are judged ... thank you but always good to talk to you sir you

art for all night which was a city wide arts festival and there was a bouncer\nAnd bouncer asked for his id\nAnd so he produced his\nCounsel identification card [noise]\nAccording to spokesperson for for gray yes and according to the spokesman the employee would not accept the card [noise]\nNow according to check these who is the spokesman for for Vincent gray said that that this guy basically told the guy just you know just chill out but according to these great ... great was pushed out\nAnd he reported that he fell and was injured after he was pushed out the door but he refused medical attention at the saying okay well there's so much that it's literally by a down\nThere so much going on here you know he's Seventy five years old so and and what circumstance do you need to check this guy's id data man or a club\nDo you think maybe there was some kind of thing that if you're over a certain age it's free or if the on you're a member of the city council or something like that you don't have to pay because you're there for you know for work reasons maybe I don't know that's all I could think of\nIt was art all night [laughter] it was it was a government there was a government

my\nRight and but meanwhile with this thing going through and just just Seventy seven if you do not stop it\nIt'll significantly raise payroll taxes and insurance premiums for many businesses in town I imagine after initiative Seventy seven past and even before that you must have been hearing a lot from businesses in Washington DC this will be if that would this would affect what have you heard from them\nWell I've heard quite a bit of concern from businesses put of greater concern or impact to me the fact that workers overwhelmingly are opposed to this it's not hard to go into a restaurant and find a server to\nKnow about the issue hand are very upset about the issue and want the initiative repealed and I have never seen an issue like this that's meant to help workers where the workers who are intended to be helped our posed I mean really we had a hearing hearing was sixteen hours worker\nWorker the room with food workers who said no this will hurt us we don't want it\nShould should the DC Council have the ability to repeal the will of the voters I'm with you I think that the initiative Seventy seven is horrible I I think it's bad for business I think it's bad for workers for all the reasons that you just a new marinas but should your counsel have the ability to just change the will of the voter at will be able to vote like this\nWell I hate to put it that way but the fact is that as the elected legislature were responsible for all laws and if a law has a bad law whether it was passed by us or passed by Congress or passed by voters\nOh we have a duty to ensure that philosophy fixed it's either a revised or repealed and we've done that before we voted on a bill and chewing concerning evictions and repeal to two weeks later with a better version\nSaid it's not unusual the other thing you're going to be voting on is whether to ban renting on second homes on air being be and this is a new version of previous legislation why did you mean what is the change that was made and why was it made\nWell there's a lot of misunderstanding that build dealing with short term rentals folks are saying please don't take away my ability for home sharing to rent out a room in my house or the basement in my house through platform and such and they're being be\nThis legislation would permit that to continue what we was this legislation would prohibit his\nA second investment property and that's where we see a lot of problems such as a party houses or neighbors to complain that there is a constant stream of strangers as they don't know who they are and coming and going and that's not good for a residential neighborhoods\nSo this would limited to Ninety Days when the owner is away more up to Ninety Days in a calendar year so theoretically they could be away from the home and rent it out for Ninety Days consecutively or Ninety Days or her weekends or something along those lines you would still give them the opportunity\nFor no more than Ninety Days is that right correct\nIf they're not president if they've like you go on a two month vacation you winter um rent your home out on a short term basis\nOr you or you can do that as you said a competitive of Ninety Days right out you know you can still do a lease so if you have a second property in investment property you can have a lease with attendance but that's different\nBut I guess the difference here is a lot of people prefer the air being based out because they can generate a lot more revenue than they could with standard lease agreement because they bring in people who are transient the downside though is the hotel industry in Washington DC not happy about this and they've got a lot more money in this game don't take a council number\nWell the hotel do with a support legislation but that's not the primary driver here has to do with the fact that I'm the one hand somebody wants to run out of room in their house on a short term basis should be able to do that and that will be permitted clearly permitted which right now there is no regulation but if\nYou're going to be absentee if investors recruiting at like a commercial property this legislation says no\nOur DC Council

Moore is the chief economist at the Heritage Foundation and a former economic advisor to the Trump campaign Steve good morning\nOur guys good morning or good to have you so what's the difference here why is this different than NAFTA\n[laughter] running just start by saying now that there's this whole negotiation was really vintage Donald Trump you know uh he played a candidate a bit like a federal here\nShow the first and best opportunity would have been the first background yes and those are really dependent on somebody stepping up you know I couldn't interview your neighbors and work associates\nWho don't always know about a high school frolic seldom does the FBI go back into high school other than to pull your grades\nBut run run run drinking though it was one of those things that almost always gets asked about right by a ... gators especially when you want to know about somebody when they were younger\nThat's absolutely true and so drinking to excess uh were was somebody to ...\nThere was somebody to surface that than the FBI should have proved that\nBack then during the first investigation and now they're stuck with kind of probing it now\nThirty six years later yeah if it had come up and and that's the challenge here these background investigations\nThe FBI on the first one and and uh every intervening one is not going to go back and identify you know your your biggest circle of friends in high school\nAnd enforce them into interviews it really is dependent on somebody you know are saying look this guy has a drinking problem this guy drinks till he blacked out this guy throws up when he drinks that you know a six pack or he doesn't drink a six pack he drinks a case\nThat that information has to come up in some way can you miss something certainly it can happen uh and and it makes it more difficult to assess if if any of that turns out to be true\nIt makes it more difficult to us us for us to assess it I think fairly today three decades later\nRight now the the information that they did this is just an information collecting investigation is is not they don't lay out a case do will be put in this report if they believe that one of the witnesses is lying\n[laughter] well you know their job is to really a challenge or some people but really let them way out in a narrative fashion what they believed to be accurate\nOr they may push back on that if they have information to the contrary if something doesn't sound right they may push back and challenge it\nBut this is very much compiling the words of other people\nAnd presenting it to back to the White House this the FBI Israeli serving as a contractor here this is not a criminal investigation it's not a national security investigation and its traditional forms there is no compulsion they can't they don't give you a grand juries of pain and say you will be here to testify if you don't want to talk to them\nYou know like if you're a very close cabinet or a friend or Ford friend and you have information to the region or something to the contrary to what they upset\nYou you may say look I I don't want to talk to you guys I have nothing to say be banned and in part you may want to do that because you've seen this circus play out on Capitol Hill and you don't want your own life pried open in the public view\nSo ah the but the FBI has no way of compelling you to to answer their questions\nTo appear you know perhaps Congress could issue a subpoena so there are some nuances here but the FBI is very much a responding to the White House request and trying to fulfill that request in a way that is not a criminal investigation not a national security information they're they're serving its contractors right\nHere Senator Chris Coons a Democrat asked a Senator Jeff flake to do this very thing there it's delaying it by we easily weak enough time to gather all the information the FBI needs\n[noise] well look with with the right amount of cooperation and the right scope of what the FBI has been asked to do by the White House\nUm I think they could do this work in a in a few days and get it on paper and get it back to the White House and then it's then is air obligation to share it with the Judiciary Committee the question is is it ever going to be enough\nUm we've seen how politicians on both sides have in effect already cast how they intend to vote 'em so does this change anybody's mind is there a likelihood that somebody's testimony will be blown up by what the FBI uncovers here\nUm I I Would think at the end of this week we may be at the same spot that we were at the beginning of the week where the sides are already divided up and nothing has really changed other than a week has passed\nOut All right Ron thank you so much really appreciate your insight

matter what it doesn't really matter all comers come in what is the country look like in ten to Fifteen Years\nI frankly think that there would be a lot of big problem is one big problem is that you would\nSee a change in technological innovation right now for example we're talking about quitting self driving cars other technologies that would be a humongous we productivity enhancing wide develop such technology is if you can just rely on cheap labor instead\nAnd then you also will develop a more a society even more divided by class you're all ready you have to talk of class warfare of people were attacking this group or that group but then if you have a large group of people who are foreign born who don't necessarily feel a connection to the country are not assimilating into the country's mainstream\nThen you could have a really big danger in which class becomes the same thing as\nAs color and ethnicity and that engenders a huge amount of tension too so I see a lot of problems down the road if we if we pursued that policy\nYeah I I have this theory and it's just based on my own experience my grandparents came to this country my dad was very close obviously we grew up speaking German and English in the household on I was very blessed with that\nBut I think we're starting to see generational gap set the further you get away from the people the generation that emigrated here legally and the less you know of their story as to why they made the sacrifice to come here legally\nYou you lose that connection and that's why this whole immigration thing to people to a lot of people they don't know the story so it doesn't mean anything to them and that's where I think the dangerous and that's where I think a lot of this comes from ...\nWell I don't agree with you entirely for that reason I Believe that people who have immigration and their families oftentimes are very sentimental about the issue and they don't they neglect the fact that when you're looking at immigration states in the Nineteen hundreds\nOr you know in other erodes the American economy with very different American society was very different we didn't have a large extensive welfare state right we didn't have all these policies that really make the nature of immigration very different from what it had been in previous years\nYeah okay right 'cause my grandparents couldn't take advantage of any kind of welfare state and they had to have sponsors\nAround one one of the typical pushback see her for somebody who's calling for a restrictive immigration system one in which we defined who gets to come in and when a is that what you're really doing his dog whistling in the end this is about filtering it down so that only white Americans can preserve\nTheir existence in the United states had to respond to that [laughter] well\nI think it's actually the opposite of the case so when you look at what happens when you have any more controlled immigration system what actually happens is that you have more integration you have more intermarriage\nRight so if you look at the Irish and Italian immigrants in the early Nineteen hundreds in the late Nineteen century they weren't inter marrying when you
