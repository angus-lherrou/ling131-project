[noise]\nAnd I'm Paul Ryan didn't want to be speaker but he became the speaker because they begged it'd be speakers as though he's like a reluctant leader he really want to be the leader and we know he's leaving [noise]\nAnd um the moderates in the party have fled we have a record season of Republican retirements\nAnd he said that most of the members of the Freedom Caucus come from safe states red districts where where you there's a lot of gerrymandering and they're likely to return and they'll have increased then you're already so they're going to have more power\nAnd he says they're going to be representing the base there they're representing Trump's base and who want them to be more combative more enthusiastic and supported their in their support of the president I think he's probably right about that [noise]\nUm and in order to curry favor with them Kevin McCarthy has a personal Rick very close personal relationship with Trump\nThat would that would that part of the party growing more powerful you've got the more moderate Republicans who were being left out because you're developing these two camps one says the G O P can't govern and it goes into a whole list of things that

get something done I Would love to you know how many of us are sitting here listening to this going yeah and they sent they sent budget to the president to be signed twice that didn't include funding for a wall and and and and didn't include things that he said he wanted well some\nOf it some of it rests on the president to though I mean the the president has decided\nThat wall funding is important to him but not important for him to go enough that he shuts down the government on right so he set some limitations he got like a little bit of funding was at one point three one point six\nMillion dollar Olympic three are in this last ... around the funding for the wall but beyond that he wanted at least five billion dollars for it he didn't get it he's not willing to yet go to the mat for that he does say maybe after the midterms he'd be willing to shut the government down over that and just say hey insist that he gets his that wall funding\nBut he's not there yet also we've not really seen any appetite from the White House to get control spending we're talking about deficits and debt it's rising it's true and luckily we have a great economy right now but the final\nThe final piece of that if you want to keep the economy going well get control the government spending and I hope the White House comes out with the spending message within the next year one that they're actually concern about raining in out of control government spending\nYeah and it would be great if Republicans can actually learn as Cindy said you know the president's trying to train these guys

it\nTogether especially if you want to keep your majority in the house right you have to convince Republican voters that you're actually going to do something with it up right in order to get them to show up yeah no you're right people aren't going to run out Republican voters are going to run out and vote for Democrats but they might stay home if you can't convince them\nThat you're worth keeping

[noise] I'm\nA good morning [noise]\nSpeaking of the president\nIs she is eagerly anticipating who is twenty twenty competition or it's going to be for president of the United states they think well we're not even past the midterms yet yeah I Know\nBut tell that to Cory Booker who this Saturday was speaking to the Iowa Democratic party this past weekend\nAnd he was absolutely on fire here's Cory Booker listen to this guy\nFor presidents have with our universe [noise]\n\nOh yeah that sounded like love the winter is single gosh that sounds so familiar what was that that did that again [noise]\n[laughter] oh that's right thank you Howard Dean I'm so Cory Booker op too hot start in Iowa and he wants to obviously be president of the United states but I my my the one of the thing that stands out I saw this headline political has a report already\nHe kind of make I think that the war's me I have you considered maybe the Cory Booker Kamala Harris says in this race do you think that either of them\nWill be competitors are well I\nThink obviously they were you know ducking for the position during that Brett Kavanaugh yes right on it but I think if you were looking for raising your numbers in the polls Spartacus did that far more than Kamala Harris right this is why this is my thing Mazie Hirono has been so out there you know she's been turning up the crazy\nBecause she wants people she wants her name recognition good or bad I wouldn't be surprised if you see her throughout her really yeah you think you know where she's combative literally nowhere I mean who knew Mazie Hirono a month ago she's come out of nowhere and she's just turned up the crazy and she's out there all the time\nShe's nuts I don't know if she's that not\nNow I don't know I don't know if I'm not that she'll run for president\nBut here's the thing is I think Cory Booker goes further in the process and Kamala Harris ... when it come on has has going for her is for the Democrats she checks boxes they're all that checking box well she's a black female exactly so she's got to where it's Cory Booker only has one 'cause he's a man\nIf one of them comes out as gay that's another box or trans by his gender whatever whatever the weird lives corruptions are you know as many of the thirty one different genders that you can check off to check off a couple of them you know punches your ticket to the big table\nHere like practically democratic consultant now I'm Glad you're here shortly shirt but through this process Frank is in Washington DC this morning Frank and mourning mourning\nTheir question um\nWhat are the Democrats finger gonna run on I mean we've got the best of me that in a long long time the unemployment rate across the board and for several little segments yup is the best it's been forever I mean you look at all the different measure holes and and because I mean we're doing so well what are they going to run on it and one other question I had\nUm that I keep asking myself is every time Trump goes to do something as far as the courts or not the courts so but as for immigration and everything some judge someone will judge somewhere blocks from why does\nA Trump picked up to the Supreme Court and a ... you know since the fact that the president has the right to do these things constitutionally why doesn't he\nHe confront them and say no this is a presidential power and then if they have to take the Supreme Court\nTo stop these little little beyond judges from rock and everything he does\nActivists well I think a couple of things on the latter question he's obviously appointing a bunch of judges to the federal courts and continuing to do that so that should help change the nature of some of this\nAlso he has brought some of these flights to the Supreme Court ah into consideration but the travel ban and things like that um and remember they did a rewrite of the travel ban in order to get it through while was being considered by the court and general um but\nBut on the former questioned what a Democrat is going to run on it's not hard to see how they kind of twist\nA lot of Trump's successes into this claim that has their own right so this is what we often see is well Trump successes on the economy doesn't really Obama's success is he's just the beneficiary of all those things are weird interesting so are you saying that the Clinton Administration was the beneficiary of Reagan's success no we're not saying that\nWhat are you saying exactly or the other the other part of this is Democrats think that health care is the big winning issue for them\nThey have an inability to actually focus on it though for some reason they\nThey think that if they run on healthcare Obamacare and is and and universal\nUniversal healthcare of any kind single payer that that's going to be the winning issue for them their problem is they're so hysterical on a daily basis about Trump and his dignity\nDoes that they get distracted from their own ... quote unquote winning talking points and that's the that's the last point I think Democrats are going to run on is restoring dignity to the oval office this idea that President Trump expresses himself the wrong way who cares about all this success who cares what he's actually accomplished\nHe says things in a way that are uncomfortable he's vulgar\nSo we need somebody who's not vulgar that's the solution and that's why right now you see somebody that institutional Democrats are longing for the days of rock Obama because he said things the right way\n[laughter] I really hope that that's what they run I we're going to restore dignity 'cause [laughter] jokes just write themselves [laughter] six to any foreign WMA I'll [noise] I agree with\nThat one of five point nine at the end

Andrus when they when they took off\nAnd it's you don't realize how big air force one is\nBecause I thought well how can you be on the same plane and only talk to each other for thirty minutes it's

president said that there were no ... there was no collusion but what one of the other things he said after the meeting was\nOn that he believed that it that he's going to be treated very fairly everybody understands there was no collusion there's no Russia it was all made up by the Democrats they're the ones that colluded with Russia the Democrats colluded with Russia and frankly frankly the previous administration didn't do anything about Russia when they knew they should have [noise]\nUm so right now it looks like Rod Rosenstein ths jobs safe\nNow what would your report for reporting from ... from Jonathan Swan Solomon from that child on solemn oh I've got so his front I thought it was for Axios John Solomon from the hill where she's reporting saying oh no that was not a joke that was told now to the committee last week in testimony by James James Baker [noise]\nDo you think the president is is not doing anything with Rod Rosenstein in order to keep an eye on them to keep your enemies\nEnemies close to your friends close in your enemies closer do you think that's what's going on here or does the president truly believe that Rod Rosenstein meant it as a joke it wasn't he wasn't serious about it well I think\nI remember the concern about firing him ahead of the election was this notion or had at the mall or investigation being done with this notion that he'd be throwing out any evidence that he was a part of the perception of obstruction so this was something that the lawyers in the White House revising against the president seems to be heating their words\nOne the one of a question for me is what's happening with the classification those documents that we're supposed to be declassified that reveal what's underneath the Pfizer Pfizer warrant application what actually was in there the president was going to declassify them and then said wait a second no we're not doing it are allies of asked us not to\nAnd the guys the red eye guys who prove proceed us You're on a W A L I heard them talking about this this morning they think\nThat Michael Horowitz the inspector general the whole reason President Trump sent it to him mhm it because the White House finally got a chance to look inside these documents and was like whoa\nThere's actually signs of corruption or criminality here the inspector general the Justice Department should take a lot of the things first they see it as an encouraging sign for President Trump that he did not declassified so we'll see we'll see I think there's a lot more to come on the story and it's\nVery

I'm so glad you're on to really that because at this throughout this entire saga which was was he telling a joke wasn't any I the only thing I can think of when I look at Rod Rosenstein is like that guy is never told a joke in his entire life like I'm not even sure he lasted jokes but they are not at all\nAnd he likes that he's got a very dry sense of humor and and him saying something like that and then people around him\nMaybe some of the career people are somehow taking it that I think he was serious I can see I could actually see that happening well do\nThe police have a lot to deal with a tremendous amount to deal with everything from having gauge suspects to handling handling actual crimes like this to just the threats that exist to them for doing their jobs\nYeah it's it's as he ... he was that he also spoke about Chicago because Chicago is the poster child for everything that is wrong with crime in this country and and the president addressed trying to solve that problem\nThe crimes free is a terrible bloody [noise]\nOn that city will do everything possible to get it done [noise] I Know the law enforcement people in Chicago and I know how good they are\nThey could solve the problem if they were simply allowed to do their job and do their job properly and that's what they want to do [noise] so Chicago we're going to start working with you as of today [noise]\n[noise] he went on to say that he was going to send a Jeff Sessions\nTo Chicago a he said also talked about a stop and frisk that if it is used properly\nThat stop and frisk is is initiated and police to properly that it's a very useful tool in fighting crime which is very true it worked really well in New York and then people started to sue and said it was being used properly and and they got rid of it and the crime rate in New York has since\nTicked up up and up and I know a lot of that also has to do with the\nNew mayor and him coming in and being very I'm very liberal and a lot of his attitudes them Lazio yeah the\n... down to ... to Greece or mansion greasy mad you know they that's what I thought the cops keeps saying oh yeah my ... so that he's just spoken up of Gracie Mansion with his wife probably I mean he's\nHe's made it okay try and turn it into the San Francisco like it's okay to you know to urinate on the street now it's not a crime and I kind of stuff\nIs that by the way the weird thing oh I thought that was the urinating on the street that oh no that's okay but it's still alive and well\nOkay good [noise] um but the president said that uh that he's going to send us Jeff Sessions and they're gonna try to solve this problem and he said we strongly oppose efforts from politicians who tried to shackled law enforcement let's see whether Chicago accept help\nThey need it will straighten it out fast they want to straighten it out sometimes I think maybe it's possible though that they don't 'cause remember\nThe president offered help to Chicago before rama manual so we don't need your federal help you wanted to send the national guard remember well ... and and and and uh Manuel Manuel said no but yet you're starting to hear from local leaders from community leaders in Chicago asking for the federal government to come in\nAnd solve this problem and and they're they absolutely want the help from the feds who it's going to be interesting to see if the president does get to get to do that and I think that was a huge message to the people of Chicago that hey I Want to help you out your mayor doesn't want you to be helped out\nWhile the president clearly cares about it he brings up all the time\nYeah he does I truly believe that he genuinely cares about law enforcement and I can be wrong but I truly get that feeling

back to Web mhm of doing okay I'm tax dollars at work seven twenty nine and W a male\nThis was different this was the Redskins busting assignment this was the Redskins making just stupid penalties this was the Redskins playing in a way that every high school coach would be embarrassed\nTo have his team play wow and that's why they got blown up by the states that yes the states are very good on office\nBut the Redskins were it was like they never played football before their lives sometimes and truthfully some of those guys on the team\nShould go to the to the owner and say look you keep my paycheck or donate to charity because I didn't perform today like a professional football player doesn't mean hey I didn't win the game that means guys didn't even know who to cover guys didn't know what to do guys it was just it was just abysmal\nWell coach Jae greed and said it was just a total team debauchery I Am the one in charge I take responsibility for what happened what broke down\n[noise] married the first thing that that really stood out that broke down was the past coverage\nIt seemed to have some good receivers and obviously it all primer of a quarterback but there were too many times when the Redskins defensive backs were linebackers didn't know who to cover so saints receivers were wanting free they were just wide open with nobody there to mark them\nAnd that's one of the reasons that Drew Brees set the record for all time passing yard isn't the first half\nAs a matter of fact he probably is a good sport\nShould've thrown this fish back in the first episode look I Can't take credit for a lot of these first ... yards 'cause you guys didn't cover our receivers and I think you can go back to the the record setting touchdown pass it was a sixty two yard pass\nDown the right sideline to a receiver who was wide open because Josh in orbit apparently did not cover the guy he was supposed to drop back deep is that he stayed up close we're Fabian row another Redskins quarterback was already covering\n... nobody was left back deep to cover that receiver so it was a record setting sixty two yard touchdown pass that you or I could have thrown pretty much because there was no Redskin anywhere near the receiver that's one of the reason the things that we are talking about\nWhere we talk about not getting beat but rather ... looking like you've never played football before in your life\nI you know Trevor ... one of the curiosities of at the Redskins this season now that we have four games under our belt is how my whole or the team looks I mean you look at least one and three\nYou have a great Redskins football team one is offering a lot of encouragement to fans we two and four year like up here we go again what's going on with the Washington Redskins have you ever seen ... performance does that have been this desperate from the same exact team\nThat's a great point vents and the answer to that is no normally you settle into a mean in other words you settle into where this is about as good as we are sometimes you play a little better sometimes a little worse but the Redskins are on the top of the world or the the the gum or the bottom of commuters shoe\nAnd that is just such a wide the disparate result\nI think at this point I mean there's been a lot of criticism of the coaching staff and head coach specially\nAt this point I think there needs to be a real evaluation as to whether or not this team is preparing\nIn a way that will will get the best out of them we can we get I get it there were a lot of injuries there this gave especially on office\nOr the Redskins have dealt with injuries overtime but they've also been wildly inconsistent and there needs to be an internal evaluation as to why that is because right now they've got no chance of busting a grape as a as a playoff team unless they can be a consistent enough to play up to the level of the players who are healthy and on the field\nWell I'll give you credit for being totally honest in your criticism with them and maybe maybe what they need us need to go down there kicks them by\nWell you know something as I'd be happy to do it a good but you know truthfully that they've got a lot of really good players out of the problem is some of those players disappeared in this game sorry well they have to come ultimately from inside the locker
