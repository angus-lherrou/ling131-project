saying that uh he obviously has upon an opponent to all of this the idea that we would bother enforcing the border for something like this but I it's it's it's it's a bit cruel and cynical to say that the only thing the president even cares about here's the mid term\nI I agree and this idea that they say there's new invasions children what is the child to be here with your child how is that going

president of the United states has a pretty strong case when he goes after the media and the effect\nThey have on the national discourse he's tweeted several times over the past couple of days about his concerns about the media driving us apart and I think that that's true they clearly have\nI mean look at the way they've reacted to some of the violence we've seen across the country both in the case of stays are say walk\nAnd then also in the case of Robert Bowers depressed looking to exacerbate the divisions that those two men were hoping to create by by effectively saying the president and by extension his supporters are responsible for the device\nThe divisions that those two men were hoping to create by by effectively saying the president and by extension his supporters are responsible for the divisiveness we have in this country and not just responsible for the divisiveness but that they were actually to blame\nFor those attacks despite the lack of rational sense that

of the American people for his president like they used to the news media says what do you think of a gym in Washington DC there's one in the morning\nLike hey good morning I I think that this agreement and in your room there is is a semantic one about the severity of the definition of of the word anymore and short I think that can be solved with with the word adversaries there's a difference between adversary and enemy the press here is adversarial\nTo a lot of the ideal that that we all I think collectively uphold right and that doesn't make them an enemy So Russia as an adversary China as an adversary al ... is an enemy or there's a difference between\nAn adversary and an enemy now we can talk about whether or not the president should know that different than\nThem and you use the words correctly but I think that's what the issue\nOf him that you brought up a really good point I think first of all I think the semantics matter I'm a big believer that words really do matter and that's that then it's obviously come out in this argument that why I'm taking a position I Am but I think you're right and I by the way I think Jim to your point I think the president does use the word enemy as a synonym for adversary clearly\nWhen he's talking about the ... she's not talking about rounding up the print the press always talks about like there's this exit central threat to them because Trump there is not ... he's the most accessible president we've had a long time to the press\nI said I didn't know if he was still here he is but but [noise]\nI I ... they don't like him and so they're going to get everything they can so it doesn't matter whether he's the most accessible they don't like him and that's where I agree that in a lot of times some of these media

publish the truth they publish opinion under the guise of truth\nAnd you are doing this country disservice and your weapon I think the media against this president yeah and in my view if this were foreign media doing this we would consider them the enemy just because they're in this country doesn't make them any less an anti a great\nDebate to have this morning thank you for having a right here

know good tending a service I we saw just this week in Kentucky a man allegedly a white man trying to go into a black church and ended up killing two people nearby the church unable to get into the church the door was locked unable to get in\nSo looked like a a crisis inside that church may have been averted on a thank thank God unfortunately two people were killed\nIn the grocery store parking lot but this is not the first time we've seen as we've seen incidents such incidences at churches were people of faith are being targeted\nAnd I think you're right to be concerned are is your parish at the people that are in your parish do they feel comforted by the fact that you are carrying\nWell you know again I live in central Pennsylvania I'm rural Pennsylvania with the exception of the fact that Penn State university is about five miles from me I'm we're rural America I Know there's a number of members of my parents had to carry their their uh personal firearms to church yeah um\nAnd you know I I'd like to think that people that come to our parish are free to just worship and not worry about the outside concerns yes you know you know we pay attention to things that go on around us but you know we come there and were free to worship\n[noise] you know it's interesting because people will be ... and the fact that we're at this point in our in our country's history where we have to have people inside houses of worship who are carrying in order to protect themselves from people from the outside who can come in whereas before you just kept the doors open but here's an anti may be feeling this wrong\nBut I think back in the day if you look at the throwback I think there were a lot of people who were in churches in houses of worship synagogues and so on\nWho were carrying at the time and so that was never fear and the doors were always open it's when we started disarming people that we decided we need armed guards or having the pastor carry of all people are wrong and that is\nFunny so um I grew up in the Washington DC area and I had a lot of family\nWho were involved in ministry three of my uncles were pastors and I remember my uncle John he ... he had his gun on his hip and I remember thinking it was funny at the time but now here I Am\nI'm however many years later four years later and you know I'm essentially doing the exact same thing that I laughed and local job for them but the fact is that um again people who come to church should be free to\nUm worship freely and not be concerned about who might come in the door\nI'm with evil intent and I specifically use the word evil evil intent and try to do harm and disrupt the worshipping God\nYeah I mean look the apostle Peter carrying the sword alongside Jesus I mean this is like there's ... actually precedent for this in the Bible defense some of the fence is not is not ruled out\nWell and and you know you're absolutely right that's a perfect example but you know I'm you know a pastor's a shepherd and shepherd is supposed to protect the ... from the world yeah I'm In ... to protect them spiritually and the and the obvious case of people but literally um you're supposed to protect their lives\nNow you said in and you said a at a bishop in your piece of why you choose to pack a pencil that it just just this past Sunday that you saw somebody lurking in the rear of the sanctuary it to explain what do you mean by that\nWell yeah so I was actually in the middle of my sermon or were traditionalist church so on my back usually facing the congregation a lot of the time yeah but\nYou know give him a sermon and so I've heard some rustling in the back I'm at the back door and and you know it sort of caught my attention and then someone was taking their time getting up the stairs and you know\nI think everybody in the congregation solve the expression change on my face 'cause I was watching to see what was coming up the stairs and it turned out it was just one of our members who was a truck driver and was running late\nYeah keeping your eyes open now not hard to hard to blame you're given the events of this weekend and certainly the past few years we really appreciate your

having their migrant crisis when those people were were coming across the border and marching across Europe to get to wherever they wanted to go Germany infamously decided to keep the borders open\nAnd uncle and Merkel was a big proponent of that you have to be welcoming and we have to absorb these people had to bring them in and you saw videos from some of these German towns where people were just like our count as being overrun what is happening here and you just saw these are just just marching\nThrough their town and and and they were they were just standing there like what the heck is going on and uh and uh so that was that was the big thing for them and twenty Fifteen the arrival of more than one million asylum seekers\nOn that was it that was the whole game for Angela

didn't want this at all\nNo and and we were ... when I think this is so interesting is so important\nThat we look at the reason why she's lost power and why her party's not doing well and why she's

right now and I'm I'm already seen reporters from the New York times\nSaying basically urging you not to get distracted by this\nTo ignore this news Glenn Thrush in New York Times D.C corresponded tweeting this morning\nI'll look it's another new cycle hijacked inside the red zone of a mid term election\nWhat is your job to report the news rather than tell the rest of us to ignore it\nWell the president as the president say enemy of the people that they're telling you know like a dog on the bone marrow have if they're telling you to ignore [noise] you know certain things because they don't want you to know about it here look over here look over here they are not disseminating the news or the news\nCome on board and stop the open borders of the legal loopholes that tree Central Americans different that Mexicans coming to the United states\nMercedes I noticed you know in ... this month we find out the border patrol sending record number of families have crossed the U.S border in September which was a jarring number to here and then yesterday it was Fox News's Shepard Smith comes along and says\nHe looks into the cameras and look there's no invasion no one's coming to get you there was nothing at all to worry about and then he went on to say this is just a mid term plays that your view of us\nKnow I mean this is a national security concern is what we have here out within the the caravan at and let me ask you there's a caravan coming the United states every day there's two thousand people who are attempt to cross the border on many make it through the border and then we have this week it we can immigration law that at twenty days\nA large number of these individuals' especially for Central American are released into the jury or our country\nA again because of the polls that are these differences between how Central Americans are treated versus that's because the sec because the repatriated normally back to their country and so the key is to a close these legal loopholes in order to ensure that that the\nBorder patrol agents have ... detained and remove a these illegal aliens for the country so again I was just this is a national\nSecurity concerns that we're dealing with I mean I I'd any country that has borders any cuts feeling with the rule of law such as ours you have a seven thousand people deciding that they're going to walk and try to cross the border\nIt it is a lawless bad or is it a chaotic that better um it it should not be allowed there is a process in place within the United states we are a very generous country when it comes to recruit immigrants coming to America but there is a process\nWhich is those who apply a through the regular names are legally to come to the United states that that's what we want to uh we want to call\nFor just one more quick question on immigration what about the idea of just being a health concern because these people are on vaccinated we don't win diseases they're bringing with them is a possible in any way\nTo keep them quarantined you know under the guise of a quarantine in order to find out if your incubating any diseases is that one way in order to hold them and keep this from from from them going into the interior of the country\nYou know there are obviously this is a multi agency process that includes carpet of homeland security it includes\nA ha chested including the department of defense now but the health and Human Services they provide a lot of the medical services for the children of particular a department of defense for at all but they also will you know\nHelp put it in that situation you know I Can't get a tiny specific the terms of what they're they're going to plan or detailed and the cool right now is to stop the caravan for coming in the presidents that it made it very clear where we're not going to let you in the United states\nAnd what we saw the pictures that we saw last week of you had\nYou know hundreds of these migrants that are trying to ram through you know get through the bridges get through the fence that it's it's a very alarming and at ... caravan let's remember there are those who if they're being threatened right in their countries they have an opportunity to apply for\nAsylum is a in Mexico as a safe first country and so I think that that is very important message as well so yeah uh it it it it becomes very complicated and I think that the president is doing what he can with his resources that at the end of the day that Democrats have really sit in silent on this issue\nYes they are allowing for the borders within the United states their fates ever came to the table when the president came up with a very generous plan to deal with closing the legal loopholes 'em and dealing with the issue DACA they walked away and now we're stuck and I have to tell you that is that what we want to the United states\nClosing the legal loopholes I'm dealing with the issue DACA they walked away and now we're stuck and I have to tell you that it's not what we want to the United states of America there is a way that we can have effective immigration laws and ensure that individual come to this country legally\nMercedes before we let you go I've got to ask you about the president the United states telling Axios that he wants to end birthright citizenship by executive order I'm seeing Glenn Thrush with the New York times saying this is nothing more than ... attempt to hijack the news cycle ahead of the mid term election what are we to make of this\nYou know I think that the president's weighing different option when it comes to immigration is one of his\nPriorities at a ... ...\nEspecially with a rational cycle it forward I mean the reality is that for the president has said the issue of securing the border of having a merit based immigration system and it is that if you I mean what you're talking about that the number of illegal aliens coming to the country to increase\nIt up a you know over a hundred percent increase in terms of family coming into the country and putting our border patrol agents are written all the time I mean you hear those stories where literally they drop off\nA children or the company fighters the smuggler take the children take the dangerous journal dirty in the United states were over a third of the young women are being sexually assaulted\nThroughout this dangerous dirty I mean it's very very troubling we want to promote the immigration we are very generous countries to immigrate to America to be able to build their lives but

policies do writers creaky line by not cross it\nAnd we found that to be a very strains used a war of choice words really nobody wants to be or anything creepy I'm we pay Google doesn't just crossed the line but they moved back creepy line on a daily basis\nSo these companies Google Facebook Amazon they all have a tremendous amount of power by virtue of both the money and the information than Americans turn over to them on a on a daily basis what are they doing with all of that power well\nThat question because you know ultimately you have a company like Google collecting all of our

it actually undermine democracy\nWhat about search engines are like duct duct do or being can you circumvent that problem with Google by using those\nUnfortunately not really ... take say let's say Yahoo Yahoo actually will reference something called Google foreign tasteless\nAnd Google quarantine west essentially a list of website they don't want you visited\nSo when you start cutting out who

reference Google products and then you're really still going back to Google or at the end of this change\nNow your documentary kind of gets to the root of the political questions as well I mean one of the things we saw recently\nWas the revelation from and some internal emails and Google said they had tried to up the Latino vote in the United states with the expectation that those people would vote for Hillary Clinton that didn't break the way they expected it to a Google in other words there were a bunch of Latinos who voted for Donald Trump\nAnd that was the subject of a lot of disappointment within within Google uh do do you get into more of those questions in the film\nWe knew that we actually get into the idea that what Google is capable of and I'm just in the search and they don't want their capable move they both in certain directions\nBased on how they structure over there would be the returns you get a search engine and it starts really from the very first character you type just

L.\nIt's Larry O'Connor my friend's Debbie in Syria Reynolds with Kelly Williams understand how serious it is to get the most money when selling your home it's your largest investment after all Debbie in Syria I guarantee you that they will sell your home for one hundred percent of the asking price or they're going to pay you the difference that is that back\nWhen it comes time to sell your home more buyers that know about it the more money you'll get bottom line Debbie and Sarah developed an exclusive program to take the stress started selling your home and at the same time let thousands of buyers know about your home through their buyers and waiting acquisition program\nWon't be able to better assess it on Wednesday or next week but the money lesson here in here seems really interesting because\nYou know with with Bob Menendez Chuck Schumer dumped six million dollars into into New Jersey and has not improved his odds at all yet she's still in the lead but the numbers have been changed\n... ... tons of money had it in his direction that's not going to buy him a seat it's not working there it seems like voters have transcended political ads like they're more focused on candidates now in a way that they haven't been in the past\nEven remember the twenty sixth in presidential election where Hillary Clinton federal spending record said yes and it didn't it didn't make a difference about Donald Trump would sort of sort of split the money more wisely and targeted their their their money in the Midwest or battleground I mean this is sort of what\nWhat we're seeing these days in politics which is that money does matter as much as it used to end the message matters a whole lot more\nAnd you know you will ... or so divided it as a country that right even if you have hundreds of billions of dollars or your race thirty eight billion dollars in the last quarter but it's not going to move conservative voters and ... the you know you can't really formulate a message that's going to get them to the Democratic side\nJosh Josh you say were divided I Want to ask you about the news cycle and whether or not as having an impact on the election so we've got the packages last week we've got the shooting at the synagogue and now the president announcing a ... a suite of immigration changes this week how does all of this affect them in terms\nOf it's fair to say the Republicans got a bounce after the Kavanaugh hearings and Donald Trump job approval hit an all are highly NBC Wall Street Journal poll but there's some new evidence both nationally and in some of these individual races that that the awful news of the past week has\nHurt the president's than in a little bit and that could make a difference if he was very very close races I won't want rights I'm looking at very very very closely as Arizona the feather raising Arizona which is extremely extremely competitive yeah that's a race where the news cycle could\nMake a difference in what's going on and it's a race where I'm Kirsten Sinema the Democrat is actually up by six points in the new new NBC poll so a ... there's a lot of movement in the final week it was always an October surprise maybe even a November surprise this year\nI was speaking of objects would have had the ... of the president moving off five thousand troops to the border to keep this a caravan which you know they're going to put all the women and children up front and then all the military age men are going to be behind them\nAnd put them on the front lines just to get the optics of these soldiers stopping women and children impoverish women and children from coming into the country how those optics play\nI think it depends on where you live in an immigration is one of those issues where you live in a suburb we live here in northern Virginia a that's not an issue that Barbara Comstock what they'll be talking about in the final week at the campaign\nBut if you're you know or the Republican like Josh Hawley in Missouri or or am I wrong the Republican candidate Indiana yeah immigration is a much more of a winning issue for Republicans in front of the more conservative states so again it it kind of depends where you live and if you're in a suburban house district that\nUh we're President Trump is a lot of popular I think they're generally much more support or more immigration then you're probably going to not want the president to talk about it but Republican at a conservative state it probably is going to mobilize the\nJazz you mentioned Virginia races and I saw Washington Post piece I think recently that said look to Virginia on election night to see kind of which way the country's going in terms of some of these some of these tough fights I don't know if you share then announces but I Want to mention to ...\nThe ... Comstock in the seventh district and Dave Brat where new polling shows that isn't neck and neck race how important are those two races do you think on election night tours telling you what's happening nationwide\nSo that the rat race down enrichment is going to be one of the biggest bellwether is on the entire country or this is Brad forgot who defeated Eric Cantor\nA heavier than the one of the biggest upsets in recent history and now is actually facing a surprisingly tough fight in a race that looked like a solidly Republican state for a long time and this is an example Brett likes to talk about immigration he likes to talk about here\nBut a lot of suburban Richmond voters are are more focused on the economy healthcare and gold necessarily appreciate that that that kind of conversation right so that's a really big test the conservative district but it's also a suburban district Democrat wins down in Richmond a that's a really bad for him it for their chance to hold it how\nAll right Josh thank you so much for joining us we appreciate the like and I'm sure we're going to be speaking to you next week when all of this shakes out I'm sure it's going to be an interesting conversation thank you so much for joining us\n... it's a forty three and WMA al\n... carpet cleaning sale is on now get three rooms have carpet cleaning for just a hundred and forty seven dollars plus a hallway clean for free ...
