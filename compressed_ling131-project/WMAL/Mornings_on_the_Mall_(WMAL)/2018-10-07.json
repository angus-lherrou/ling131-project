H. chartered a a a task force of national experts and domestic violence and intimate partner violence\nAnd um what they came up with was a fourteen recommendation planned for be ha to implement and it's been a part of violence assistance program and so from that that was the inception of the intimate partner violence assistance program based on those recommendations so in January two thousand fourteen\nThat that was the inception of the intimate partner violence assistance program based on those recommendations so in January two thousand fourteen\nThey began a rapid implementation program with six the a medical centers around the country from that time from two thousand fourteen 'til now well actually until April two thousand Eighteen\nWere talking about a screening and how veterans women veterans in particular have the opportunity to talk to their health care providers about intimate partner violence if they're experiencing it [noise]\nSo exciting thing intimate partner violence can bring on many factors can you speak to us about the effects of intimate partner violence as it relates to family and life stress isolation anger possibly leading to alcoholism or use of substances can you talk to us about that\nShort let me start with some numbers so it gives you an idea of really where we are with intimate partner violence let me preface it by saying that it is not an easy situation to admit to so those who are admitting to it as very courageous for them to do that\nBut it's hard to really get full and accurate numbers of level of intimate partner violence so the general population the rate of women experiencing intimate partner violence is basically one out of three women\nFor men in the general population this one out of four four women veterans twice as much okay so if you have the same three women if their veterans is two out of three veteran limit reporting experience of intimate partner violence [laughter]\nFor a veteran then it's two out of four so half again that increases twice as much as general population\nWe know that women admit to intimate partner violence more so than men but moving on it impacts everything all aspects of living whether it's medical with his physical emotional social economic\nI'm spiritual just to name some of the health conditions that can worsen we're talking about either increase an appetite decreasing appetite if it's an increase in appetite you're talking about on any associated health concerns with being overweight\nArthritis chronic pain increases asthma can increase\nGastrointestinal problems like irritable bowel syndrome can increase\nThe risk for a TGI which is a traumatic brain injury hypertension can occur cardiovascular issues socially you talking about social isolation which is what you already pointed out trust issues and relationships and women and men who are experiencing I.

and the minute I started going on and it took about seven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it that's all you know somebody's working right if you stop in the health issues come

listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements joining us today is our good friend Dr Michael Pincus and we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and occupying is what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nWhat I'm saying it's a multifaceted problem where one\nWe're not getting enough vitamin D three in our system ... vitamin D the trees are responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly it surprised me because of medical school we learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bones\nWe get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right hand for the first twenty something years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands of the study started coming out and now there's over twenty three hundred studies\nThat just show the vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that shouldn't be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy okay so I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were study and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy\nWas due to melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading study you know I I kind of plot is right there and went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck shift in the equator and all over the world and they're getting into her but you know you're young raise them and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in Haiti or is an inside and I went oh my God it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream can you do three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nHere seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body starting to slow down\nFor us it's kind of a cleansing is that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility you start to stiffen up and you feel it at night especially if you're in a bad role in from side to side you wake up with your knees are hurting your legs are restless your shoulders hurt\nThat sets this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of the joint pain bone pain muscle paying\nFive or my al ... I Would say on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your thoughts as quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear and is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that theme good you're taking a lot of sugar and ... my thing is it's not what you what your body absorb\nWhen I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nThat's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect us\nIs when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the area that I mean he seems to affect your energy your sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it's kind of like feeling a little bit younger Christ\nAnd who wouldn't want that way and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the responses that you get from people that had been taking your formula and what kind of results that they seem\nToday I'm going to tell parents translate to play\nOut one of the teams that something is on the sleek that'd be like saying\nMean the company you're awesome [noise]\nAnother one is nothing like singing\nI Do smoke to him all\nJoe ... is a shorter better way to each other than I Am so Joe you have your\nYou don't have to be speaking to be a perfect parent thousands of genes in foster care will thing here I'm\nLearn more than a dock us kids got or\nPublic service announcement brought to you by the U.S department of health and Human Services adopt us candy\nDo you what I Would watch WMA awash\n... station [noise]\nForward vacant sales come on the attack\nFollowing intense debate Brett Kavanaugh was confirmed and then sworn in as the one hundred and fourteen justice of the U.S Supreme Court\nSenators can all agree on one thing when it comes to the cabinet confirmation it was an ugly process has been around\nLong enough to see probably left wing smear campaigns against Supreme Court nominees but this was beyond the pale Republican\nChuck Grassley led the confirmation hearings top Senate Democrat Charles Schumer says his caucus did what a good now it's up to the American people\nThat so many millions or outraged by what happened here there's one answer vote\nCabinet becomes conservative number five on the court amid four liberal justices Lindy Kenya on Capitol Hill\nPresident Trump blasted Democrats as being too dangerous to govern as he rallied Republican supporters into bigger Kansas a head of the mid term elections next month\nYou don't want to hand manages\nAs you don't you know our June hang read left wing mom\nCorresponded Alexander field reports secretary of state Mike Pompeo hope to breathe new life into talks aimed at getting North Korea to dismantle its nuclear program as he met with Kim jung going in young yang they\nAre very much going to be motivated by any signs of progress and certainly we're hearing some indication of progress from secretary of state Mike Pompeo who seemed to be character I think that's true at the festival to some extent well heading\nTo the polls today Brazilians are choosing their leaders in an election marked by intense anger at the ruling class following years of political and economic turmoil\nAnd in Bosnia and election could install a pro Russian nationalists to a top posts and then the ethnic divisions of a country that faced a brutal war twenty five years ago [noise]\nAt our house nicer complicated either my wife is freezing or I'm roasting Hi I'm Scott payment founder of born branch makers of the world's most comfortable seats loved by three us presidents for a limited time are unbelievably soft warm and breathe herbal flannel betting is back\nBecoming fourteen stunning patterns and colors you're sure to find something you love to go to a ball and branch dot com for fifty dollars off plus free shipping with promote good relief\nBut one branch dot com promo code relief\nIndividuals and businesses with tax problems listen carefully if you will over ten thousand dollars in back taxes or Arab on file tax returns us actually can help you take back control the IRS ... does your paycheck closure business and\nFile criminal charges our team of tax attorneys couldn't stop collections and get you protected us to act shield offers approach protection guaranteed to get you protected today\nUs to actually elders eight plus rated with the BBC so called I'd read by\nOne Seventy seven Ninety six us to actually killed eight hundred by\nOne Seventy seven Ninety six\n[noise] you've got an Amazon Echo you got a new way to listen to W.

lose because you can try ... absolutely risk free\nSo that number to call is one eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five I'll give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days in that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress\nIn your ... formula can help us in the battle against stress\nI'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nI I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nWe're talking about stress and we're talking about dress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could lift magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is making it seem so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that neither was involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and you've heard sample it was low levels of magnesium\nYou're going to be very important factor in life I Would say so in\nFact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium the fish and say okay you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's or anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fiber at my job high blood pressure down the migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's due process and the list goes on and on and on\nThis this is associated with a lack of magnesium and money\nSimply a lack of magnesium too so I think that really mess around with that what happens is that you need a magnesium and your body in order for the count them to be absorbed\nSo it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first one which is ...\nThat's right they work in combination with each other [laughter] now there's many more practical applications of this count back formula ... first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic\nIs for people who are under a lot of traffic and it can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble sleeping really because it relaxes your body to actually fill the relaxation after you drink the deaf you drink a cup of the chemical formula\nInteresting though the other thing that it's really really good for our people who aren't paying\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you in that case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is including arthritic Taipei and fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of area that like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you name seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person had\nA magnesium deficiencies many of them they don't absorb their food so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this is it might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real gradually overtime type of thing\nSick or you know this or that you might be overtime just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real gradually overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more rats or whatever right that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nWhere that and that started to take the count them out of the bones you start getting on life you start getting a lot because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old you and your body's actually starting to manifest\nAt all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nOut there and let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researcher it how do you get into the system\nThe formula we have the counteract formula is fantastic because you get to the powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop tickets he's sort of this powder and mix it in yeah and you drink it cut down the great my third rate is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nOr I this is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium that gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can replace

when you call be sure to mention this program and you'll get a risk free trial of ... again this was only available to your listeners and only if you call this toll free number\nIt's one eight hundred

zero five I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five\nWell if you're just joining us Dr Michael is on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and how important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their body\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiencies are not like a water main break or you have a real noticeable thing to say that we don't drift little leaks here and there and so we have is a cumulative effect where a person and start to go downhill a little bit at a time be up to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nTo pick his you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nerve and when you take this combat formula many times they will calm your back pay well I Know I ... a couple of years ago I herniated disc in my back and I always try and everything and I took out the next formula\nI drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drink it over ten day period it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone had any history of heart disease or you didn't even have bypass surgery you should be on the comics formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a candidate to lady was suffering\nAnd we talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nThe arthritic joints really respond to this\nAnd I recently gave a candidate to lady was

liquidity you got a great rate of return and so he did three very important aspect when it comes to planning for your retirement so safety let's just take that oh why did we start a radio program to begin with and fourteen years ago we decided that you know this is\nJust after the two thousand two thousand wanted us into that whole downturn at the economy we decided that we want it to be able to help people to\nSet money aside in a safe position so they could get the outside of the market but also the protected on the downside and there were things that existed that we could share with people now\nUh you know they didn't exist in the nineties but now they do because we have companies out there that are willing to ensure against the law says so whether you're on accumulating money tax free or tax deferred you've had those different options it can all be in a safe position sacred\nSo then we have liquidity which is so important in all of our strategies\nA do include liquidity so\nYou know many times people say well you know the restaurant that you sounds good and that's something certainly a leg to school but I Want a tax free source of income but yet I've spent so much of my lifetime accumulating money in a four O. one K. or an IRA or a T S P a counter for all three of these are all tax deferred accounts\nAnd uh you know short of taking that money is income and and uh\nUh you know you there's no way really to come out of those accounts tax free so these tax deferred accounts we have to consider those as well and that's why I'm part of the triple crown solution includes what we call the personal pension plan\nAnd uh this basically is a plan that we set up as an I.

I. individual retirement account\nAnd you can roll over your ... or ... or your T S P planner or even your existing traditional or raw irate can be rolled into this a personal pension plan and it gives you so many additional benefits that you don't get right now one of our favorite accounts that we utilize\nIs what we call the ten ten higher rate that is a ... an account that guarantees eight ten percent return annually for ten years later I mean think about that can you do better in the stock market I mean ... we know that the stock market has not average ten percent per year it's average more\nYou know we can show you the math I mean it really you know after fees and everything it's\nAmerica I mean ... we know that the stock market has not average ten percent per year it's average more you know we can show you the math I mean it really you know after fees and everything it's more the neighborhood of around five to six percent on an average\nUh yet the ten ten IRA is guaranteed ten percent for ten years and then of course at some point we take that Iran we start income from a higher rate and as we are taking income out of that account the account continues to participate in the upside of the market\nUh so we have increasing income even though we're deep pleading the actual asset or we want to get your information on to ten ten IRA and I'm also the rash strategy would want to get you the free book an illustration\nGive us a call or text us so we can get that in your hands with number to call or text there's one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\n[noise] to get your free raft strategy savings plans\nCall or text and your name email and ZIP Code to eight six six five four four seven seven\nFive five or ... ... email ... eight six six five four Seventy seven day\nYou're talking about that third jewel of the triple crown solution and here's an illustration just based on what you were talking about with a ten ten plan on this is I'm putting in two hundred thousand dollars at this on individual at age fifty eight and they said that they want to tick kinda let that growth for the next ten years and so\nOn by the time this person is now sixty eight years old they are able to take out\nA over twenty thousand dollars at about twenty thousand three hundred dollars that first year and it does grow as they as the um increases in the stock market are going to add to this account it's going to grow from year to year so now like three years later it's eleven thousand one hundred I'm Sorry I'm twenty two thousand yeah sorry\nAnd looking at the wrong call them here but they're twenty two thousand and then grows to twenty four thousand a hundred thousand and stuff like that so that's a kind of a neat thing to know that when I'm putting in that two hundred thousand dollars at age fifty eight\nI Know that I'm going to have income for the rest of my life as at least twenty thousand dollars to start with and then it's going to go ahead and grow grow from there from\nThen on this is lifetime income and what we call in and the amount that you're a married that it can be a joint income so that even if you pre deceased your spouse or spouse continues to get paid on an increasing income benefit\nOne of the great things about the ten ten ... is this increasing income you know so many times when we think of a counseling you know you say that word annuity or whatever what's wrong with a new these well annuities you know kind of stopping you into\nA a an amount that you're gonna receive per year and then it never grows\nSo let's say that you're retired for Twenty years or twenty five years or Thirty years\nAnd you're getting twenty thousand dollars a year well you you have no opportunity for that twenty thousand to increase to ... uh you know all of a sudden inflation or\nMaybe some of the other things that uh you know you want to take her that are happening around the world around us so ah what the ten ten and I are right we do have increasing income on a deeper shady NASA joint income\nIt also has a a provision in there that if you are you know become disabled where you go into it a retirement home or on assisted living or a nursing home uh for a period of six months or longer that that income whatever income you're a are receiving at that time is going to double for the time that you are and they're up to five years so\nThat's another benefit that comes along kind of along for the ride if you will on the turn turn IRA so if you have an irate four one K. for all three B.

Seventy seven\nDays when people call in to the program we know they're looking to do one of three things either they need more income\nOr they want to just maybe accumulate some money that they've set aside and they just want to see that gross it they can use it in the future or they want to provide for like I said now I Know that when you and me have sat down and talk about our future those are the three things that we've felt like we want it to have in place in society and some of our own\nUh advice right here we are in our own cooking and we actually did have those are things in place they have the income side of it mhm now we are focusing on the the accumulation side of it and you've also put together a lack of the plan for you in\nIn in our own personal circle\nIt's the the accumulation side of it and you've also put together like if he plans for\nA while and and in our own personal circumstances we haven't started taking distributions from many they count so we set up yet I mean we're not in a position we really don't need to do that are in the ... right now [laughter]\nAnd uh so at some point you know and that's a good thing because the longer that these kind of percolate\nThe stronger that they are in terms of uh the provisions in the uh benefits that that are received a from these accounts so now that said the rats strategy totally liquid All right you can take money out anytime you want you can use it for a a to buy a ... a a car or you know maybe have an upcoming expense that\nThat you need money from a for rather and you can take money out of the raft strategy tax free and then you can actually even put it\nBack writer so even before age ... nine and a half yeah that are getting more and these are\nTo paint a very clear picture about what you were just saying I think this is so important uh you know when ... let's just say I had a hundred dollars and I lost fifty percent how much but I have a let me do the math\nCalculator a fifty dollar fifty dollars then if there if I can get ... percent\nOh well that would be an fifty dollars that would be twenty five dollars\nAnd fifty plus twenty five is now I have any thoughts on that some people when I asked that question they said to me while I'm idiot AQAP that hundred hundred dollars and and that's and that's because they're not really critically looking at the map in fact if you take that same equation and you ask as Wall Street\nWhat's the return on that they would say oh that's the present you law if it was a ... you gain for not it's actually mine is negative twenty five or ... and by the way some people say wait a minute the rat you scan that she got to go the other direction okay let's see that one hundred fifty percent is a hundred and fifty take like ... percent is\nSeventy five okay so it's you know twenty percent while she would say that's a zero percent return so you gotta be careful about those numbers you got to understand what compound versus simple interest is\nSo important and you know we've been talking about that for years obviously you go over that in detail in the book\nThe illustrations bring this to life for people I mean I I and of course you know when we sit down in the room mate with a client or or a potential client we tried to show these numbers as they exist in other words we don't we don't need the ... the numbers they are what they are what they are I mean they're not up for interpretation\nAnd uh when you see them clearly\nAnd understand the difference between average and the difference between compound rates of return understand the difference what what is the actual benefit of a tax free versus a tax deferred\nAh and you know some of the other things about living benefits ... death benefits how about benefits if I get sick or something happens in my life that\nYou know maybe I'm terminally ill I mean there's lots of things to consider\nA that's all all of these things really go into a view what I started out the program with with was what does that decade that you need to you know the first five years what do you need to be thinking about what do you need to be considering\nAnd uh so that when you do go into the retirement phase where you're going into the deep humiliation trades now you're utilizing the assets that you've accumulated all your life\nThat you're not shell shocked that you're not surprised that you have a plan in place\nAnd that plan is going to provide your needs it's going to provide all of the needs of your of you and your family and\nAnd uh provide you with the

you know we like to have a little fun on our program uh we do these little did easier I each and every week that we feel are\nUh you know kind of personal and and uh one of the things that one of my favorite parts of the program I it\nBecause I'm a negative guy you know I'm not a guy but it's what we call the book report\nYeah so\nI'm going to talk about a ... ... is Iran is a fly above the

taxes well at all there is a service that will help you in for fractional cost will help you collect your taxes and make sure they get paid really sweet how\nGreat they\nOrdered grapes we've seen the right to continue their up toward march question is what impact does that happen on the local real estate market let me explain to you in very clear terms the difference between last year and this year not only in the cost of money but\nLet me explain to you in very clear terms the difference between last year and this year not only in the cost of money but what is actually done to prices fascinating I did the math on this last year we had three and five eight percent interest rates we currently are at four and five days to foreign three quarters\nLet's assume that we went from three and five to four and five ... that's a one percent increase in the interest rate\nIf you're borrowing five hundred thousand dollars if you're borrowing and a half a million dollars\nThe cost is two hundred Ninety dollars more per month this year for the same property\nThat essentially eats into\nYour affordability by sixty three thousand dollars so in essence if prices don't go up prices stay the same but rates increase it says if the house\nPrice went up for something you might be interested in all of a sudden a six hundred thousand dollar home that you would have put a hundred thousand dollars down on I borrowed five hundred really is like buying a six hundred and sixty three thousand dollar house because\nYou're having to pay more interest over the life of the loan now you can kill that mortgage faster if you like to I Love advertising which means to kill I Love advertising mortgages is like\nPutting a savings in your bank account you can't spend the money out of your equity but you're killing the debt okay\nHey have you tried to pay your property taxes without an escrow I Know I have tried this and it's you know the idea is if you're paying let's say a thousand dollars a year property tax most mortgage companies require that you build into your monthly mortgage payment\nPayment for the mortgage the principal and the interest but also the taxes for the property and the insurance required\nTo provide a case of a fire or damage to the property we call that the P. I. T. I. principal interest taxes insurance but there are some lenders who will say you can take care of your own as Chris pay your own\nInsurance pay your own taxes just pay us the PI I chose to do that for ten years now what happens the goal here would be maybe you could take that eight thousand dollars a stick it in your savings account and earn something on that money rather than paying it in advance\nFor taxes but how much you can earn really not much I mean if you're really disciplined then you you ... even in investing you might make some kind of a return but the back end worry that goes into your mind am I going to have enough when I hit the end of September the end of July depending upon when you pay your taxes\nIn theory you're trying to reduce your monthly payment by sending that money yourself to your local tax authority right it doesn't work that great OK you could get into a lot of trouble because let's say one day\nYou walk in to pay your tax bill and you don't have quite enough or you actually missed pay the tax bill because you've mailed in an amount based upon a previous tax bill and you miss it by three bucks what gets interesting is that\nIf you don't pay the full amount all of a sudden you get into trouble and there are penalties\nOn top of what you owe and they can put your property in jeopardy if you ignore paying your taxes if you have not paid your property taxes and need help\nPay your property taxes it's very very important you speak with your county authorities as soon as possible to see what options there are because it's especially if you're in a reverse mortgage you may not have a mortgage payment principal interest any longer but you still have to pay your taxes and insurance\nI guess I just want to recommend let the lender hold the taxes and ask grow them so they each month you're paying the same amount taxes insurance and your mortgage payment of once a year they'll recalibrate according to\nHow the tax bill reformulate spending upon the mill rate which is the percentage that they calculate the taxes against your property or based upon the cost of your insurance which might go up depending upon insurance rates
