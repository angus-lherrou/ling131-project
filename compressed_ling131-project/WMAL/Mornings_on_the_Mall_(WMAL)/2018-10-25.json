speculation I heard that you don't hear a lot of people talking about is why do we not think that this could be the Russians if the Russians are so as we've been being told over and over and over again especially by the left the Russians are interfering in our elections foreign interference in our elections\nIf they're if they're going to buy a couple of ads on Facebook to interfere with the elections why would they do something like this\nI I think for now what's ... definitely the responsible thing to do here is\nLet's wait to see what the FBI yields they're looking into this thing and they're going to give us some answers and hopefully really rapidly and I don't think that the Trump Administration is going to sit back and let this thing just faster and for us not to have answers

dozen highly rated price competitive companies well that's exactly what happens\nGiven the amount of sanctions that the the White House has put on Russia things like that also China and the trade war they've engaged them\nThey're all looking for information naturally on what the president has done intends to do as well so that's and that's what to expect that anybody and national security would tell you if you use non secured device especially if you're somebody has high profile as the president they're going to be people who are trying to invade it [noise] um what is annoying about this is that\nThe people who talked about how this information was gathered are anonymous sources apparently working for the government or speaking to the New York times working for the American government to tell them about this\nUm here some of the reporting in it or Mr Mr Trump's use of his iPhones was detailed by several current and former officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could discuss classified intelligence\n[laughter] and sensitive security arrangements oh does that make it legal is that how that works when you're talking to the times you can discuss classified intelligence so long as you do it anonymously\nThe officials said they were doing so not to undermine Mr Trump but out of frustration with what they considered the president's casual approach to electronic security\nAmerican spy agencies the officials said had learned that China and Russia were eavesdropping on the president's cell phone calls from human sources inside foreign governments and intercepting communication between foreign officials\nOh wow you're blowing the cover of human sources are indicating clearly that you have human sources inside of the Russian and Chinese governments who are feeding you this reformation about their very activities\nI'm Sorry who's in parenting national security in this conversation\nSo basically those human sources inside the foreign governments would be American spies or spies working for the American government per se trying to protect the American government trying to find out what the ... the Russian and Chinese are doing and so the New York times is reporting on that in their third paragraph at the story right so they\nNice immediately they and then and I don't uh by the way\nLike okay so the times reports that the people who are speaking to the times though it's it's it's morally incumbent upon them it's incumbent upon them from a national security perspective not to blow the cover of human intelligence within the Chinese and Russian governments\nIn an effort to say that you want to ... the president for the way he calls his friends\nIn this equation which person is imperiled national security\nIs it the president who again we don't know the contents of his phone calls what those conversations or even like ... do we have any reason to believe that he's actually discussing classified information\nThe president you should know I've watched this guy you know rather closely a lot of people have but one of the things that I've noticed through the years about President Trump is that he is famously concerned about people eavesdropping on him\nEarly in his administration remember when he first got his desk phone on the resolute desk\nHe was talking about how important it was that the message is there that he that he was able to conversations he was able to have there\nWere not able to be intercepted were classified well that didn't stop the American government from licking them remember early on that he had foreign leader conversations lake ... American government and\nSo um\nYou know the president is clearly concerned about the nature of conversations he had and whether or not people are listening\nThis is not this is crazy um it it also ... ... as you pointed out there were so many unanswered questions here you know do we know that he's he's talking about national security on on these lines we don't know that they don't meant they don't clarify that\nBut the other thing too is is if if this is that well known why do we not believe that the American government has taken steps to ensure that the stops\nThat they don't have this ability to listen and spray if it gets if it gets to the point where it's being published in the New York times why would we think that our government and and um our our intelligence community is a don't know that already and be having taken steps to stop it [noise]\nI don't think it needs to be ... I don't think it needs in the New York times reporting on it for them to go wow we should probably\nSomething about that yeah I I have a little bit more saves in them then that the idea here is that do that from my perspective both the times in their sources are deeply patronizing\nTowards the president of the United states and I don't offer a fantastic rationale for it in the very pages that were reading to cause another example of liberal elite ism five forty three and WMA now Dr will Sunday on tennis therapy some green broken tennis narrow health centers depression is\nFive forty three and W.

support without having to say I'm a racist out loud\nIt says the beans saying that the Trump is a racist that well not even basically he's saying that that trumps the races and there's like this dog was which I Know as a terminal left let's uses this dog whistle to Trump supporters\nThat if you hate Muslims if you hate black people if you hate anyone who live south of the Rio Grande\nThan Trump's the guy for you because he's a racist he's a hater but he doesn't have to come out and said 'cause he was defending the caravan and and these people who were you know on their way of saying he said that the migrants would be an asset to this country and he also went on to describe Trump voters as loading\nAnd desperately fearful the only thing they fear more than people from Central America is people for the middle east so\nOther than all of the the patronizing analysis that he's done here I'm this whole theory that everything that Trump says is a dog whistle for deplorable Z in the words of Hillary Clinton is a bit of a weird thing to say it seems like the media of if it's a dog whistle how is it that the media is the only people who can hear it\nSo like how is it that Lawrence O'Donnell is the one who can hear the dog whistle a dog whistle by its conventional standard is supposed to be something that's ... to the U.S normal people\nAnd it only a certain creature can hear it only the dogs can hear it yeah here's Lawrence O'Donnell being like hey I cut through this for you I happen to know exactly what President Trump is saying when him and what he's saying by what he's not saying all really Lawrence O'Donnell who declared on air ones that I Am a socialist [laughter]\nI mean to to to come out and has to be so patronizing about it and to and to give no\nTo give no quarter whatsoever to the idea that we should have a functional border\nLike she thinks of that conversation is racist for that conversation indulges the KKK that we should scare border really\nHe's he's really gone off the deep end with which\nYou you talk about how long does it down and said I'm I'm a socialist that label it's probably because there's nothing wrong with being socialist compassionate it's a wonderful thing Jim Carey said reclaim it to an end now Lawrence Donald though ripped on the president for saying that he's the national list and you knew he was going to do it\nA

movement to create this the ... the caravan to create more fear and loathing in his desperately fearful supporters\nSo this is the night before those Mel bombs to come out and we were having a

William county where rising and as a mom I was concerned\nThat cancer which is one of many people in Prince William county concerned about the tone of taking on our families bend in our community and\nI'm the kind of a story suggested the bomb sent to CNN had hallmarks of fake explosives\nThe kind more typically depicted on television and in movies rather than divisive capable of detonating\nA digital clock was taped to the middle of the pipe it's a feature that experts say it's typically shown on fictional bombs and attempt to ratchet up dramatic tension\nBut unnecessary in real life in fact bomb makers generally avoid attach invisible clocks to their devices to keep from tipping off their targets about when the bombs are set to explode also been west we spoke with her later he suggested\nTypically a mail bomb if it's sent would have a triggering device upon opening the actual mail not a dramatic clock strapped to the outside of a bomb so there's a lot of curiosity is associated with the actual construction of what they've been referring to his crude devices\nAnd and I heard the same comparison that Ben made last I heard that last night you know the Unabomber that's what he did when you opened the package was when it would explode and that's why some people who weren't the intended targets wound up being being injured\nBecause they open to the package and they said this yesterday who thinks George Soros walks down to the mailbox in his bathroom and slippers Allah Tony Soprano to go get his own mail like that doesn't happen who thinks that Hillary Clinton in ... and ... rock Obama opened their own mail I finally\nTrue to your point to Secret Service protect days I mean race there that obviously there's a highly involves screening process I mean part of this is like the type of person who sends a mail bomb is flat out nuts so that that could very well be the case where you're not even thinking who cares who's opening them elder prominent even processing that particular question\nNow and and the president said well we know that that you know CNN came right out and started blaming the president for this it's his fault is President Trump's fault for all of this\nThe president tweeted out this morning and said a very big part of the anger we see today in our society has caused by the purposely falls\nAnd an accurate reporting of the mainstream media that I referred to as fake news has gotten so bad and hateful that it is beyond description mainstream media was clean up its act fast so he turned it around and blame them\nAnd and I don't know if you can point to just one specific individual or one specific incidents that as the cause of this\nBut I Do believe that the rhetoric and this political cycle is so intense\nSo heated and there are so many people who are just so invested in this that and I never been to the same way I Want to kind of like OK people it's politics you need to put that in that slice of your life there's so much else that makes up your life it can't be all consuming but for some people\nPolitics as their religion they worship it is so much invested\nUnless you work in it like we do in so far as we talk about it frequently and politics is the thing you do in order to allow yourself to live the rest of your life it's a thing you get out of the way\nThere should be and the downside to all of this and the thing that I find so distressing is when you watch an event like this happen people delivering trying to to send threats or whatever this is\nSue variety of political officials just to just weeks after by the way rice and attacks were sent to the president and the Pentagon and senior military officials\nAre in this and this is not an infringement of course it happens every so often so with those types of things happening\nWhat should the call me should the called be to try and figure this out and bring us together or should it be to drive us further apart because it seems like a lot of the people were analyzing the sort of specially in the press are taking this as an opportunity to score political points on the president\nTo come out and be like the president's disgusting he led to this keep by criticizing us I eat a press keys inciting\nThis type of behavior what did you if you are going to be part of part of the free press and crow about how the first amendment the most important thing so so frequently and by the way it is the first time I've been is incredibly important then shouldn't you have a similar respect for the president's right to convey his criticism of your profession\n... humor of course late into it in and cut it over the president condoning physical violence and dividing Americans with his words and actions\nThat what this all this allows the Democrats to do in the left to do they get to play the victim which is something they love they wear the mantle proudly data that nothing makes their day more than being able to say I'm a victim and wallow in their victims\nI just can't wait for law enforcement authorities to actually get some real facts about all of this and let the air out of the nonsense of which there is a lot this morning
