generous my kid is Mike ... like she doesn't even like all the same candy I Do but when she find people who have the candy I like she goes for it because like my daddy all like the [noise] oh that's how generous my little girl anyway very proud\nOr need those memories for when she turned Thirteen I Know [laughter] All right\nI'm going to be ready for that many\nMornings I Love all five thirty five Dr Doug liberties will be with is he is a sleep disorders specialist sleep medicine specialist I heard of that guy shockingly we have a lot of questions for six thirty five is Cal Thomas seminal\nBy Mark Krikorian is with as an eight by will wreck from uh the Daily Caller on immigration and foreign policy Mary Walter with ...\nOr can I just point out the obvious that needs to be pointed out because the will of course we pointed out at some point the Doug is her husband yes he had a dog is Mary Walter ... husband but I dug which so great about dug in why we're having them on the show is yesterday morning I woke up Fifteen minutes ahead of my alarm\nAnd I had this this dilemma I said to myself I Do I just get up\nAnd I'm I'm not alone and it's like a ... like everyone has the bomb to get up\nAnd just get the day started Fifteen minutes earlier or do I try and sleep and does that even matter does my body derive any benefit whatsoever out of sleeping an extra Fifteen minutes awaiting the alarm so that dilemma and then in my head I was thinking you know get an answer this question is Mary's excellent husband who's a sleep doctor\nSo now we're having them on the show to diagnose all my mental problems [laughter] and more specifically more specifically when we talked to him at five thirty five to answer all of our questions about sleep because I have a lot of them and and I think there are a lot of people were interested in like you know what are the mechanics of this and what benefits can actually get out of an elephant\nYes especially people who are up at this hour and ... and he gets so so what are we talking about tomorrow's anything I Need to know and I'm like no just random questions from the sleep deprived morning show he's like oh okay yeah so yeah All right Doug school\nLike that I had breakfast with him last week I had to get that All right let's talk your\nBreakfast with my husband yes I did and now you're having dreams about him\nOne thing leads to another Mary I don't know how to explain that we've been working together way too long ago here's here's the thing that's on my mind this morning and its birthright citizenship and the reason for that of course is the president of the United states\nAnnouncing that he plans to bring it to an end by executive order yesterday the media's hair fully on fire over that's all\nSomething that he plans to bring it to an end by executive order yesterday the media's hair fully on fire over this all of a sudden people who I thought didn't care about the constitution were reading it to me were quoting it to me for like up there like everyone there's constitutional is everywhere now\nThey all know exactly what the fourteenth amendment means they all know precisely that a bit a grant citizenship to literally anybody who happens to give birth of the United states unless we can get them to Canada in time you know it's like the auto holding a grenade with a patient with the PIN pulled out and if you can sprinted across the border to Canada then they get the citizens [laughter] but [laughter]\nWe have today and the Bork right for all I think it's unfair for us citizens because\nIt's not fair that you can just come here and have a baby and all of a sudden the whole family becomes\nA U.S citizen right\nAnd you have a lot of people that they were in their grandmothers and grandfathers\nAnd cousins and uncles here because they had a baby here\nYou know Chris you say it's unfair disadvantage obviously it obviously unfair is putting the fashion it's on its face unfair I don't think there's a person alive who could argue that this is a quote fair system the people were trying to stand by this case\nAre making it on the basis of the fact that well this is the letter of the law this is the letter of the constitution and tough deal with that\nAnd um and there's obviously people out there who loved us to think that illegal that's that district is it a fair system no\nIdea if someone to make a case that this is a fair system [laughter]\nThis is not doesn't it just doesn't even begin to to reflect fairness I as a normative matter it's gross but as a legal matter their parents to be some questions and the president could be putting it right in front of the courts face this could be the best opportunity to actually get the Supreme Court to actually take this on\nWhich they've had to ignore for many years to the tune of three hundred thousand or so illegal immigrant babies born every year in to the United states becoming us citizens\nThat's a lot of people and we never voted on this it's just something that happens Bob is in College Park Maryland this morning Bob good morning\n[noise] ah yeah I was gonna say I know that the the countries have birthright citizenship but can we read the fine print does that mean that if your dad go to Canada um you know my parents were may instead of them that that my child you have the name that\nKnow somebody came from if I came from the United states ... about likely um had a baby there that means the baby a medium that event I mean is that what happened I mean I think that we read the fine print on that ah those thirty countries\nRight well here's here's the thing that gets me out of all that homework Bob which the thank you I mean I like looking into the details in general but I don't really care [laughter] I ... I mean birthright citizenship does exist and other countries yes in ... this morning but this is a consideration for America what's good for us we should sit down and like actually think about that\nAnd there's a whole bunch of people telling you this morning that like you know dumping not I don't think about this let's not reconsider it let's just stick to stay the course let's stick with the status quo\nCanadian just in case you want to know okay gosh Canadian citizenship is obtained by birth in Canada and the principal of ... which means on this oil or birth abroad when at least one parent is a Canadian citizen or by adoption by at least one Canadian citizen under the rules of up in ... the same thing yeah ... fancy\nFancy fancy legal where it's so pretty much the same that we have\nRight and they become a paralegal lately they've considered removing birthright citizenship is well bunch of racist [laughter] All right more from you on a second five twenty two W a male\nWas found ...

mean one\nIf you don't have a choice a power nap it's a good thing and let's in a such a lesson thirty minutes is what we recommend and a a power nap will give you anywhere from two to four hours of increase ... increase alertness\nHum and again what you're doing is less than thirty minutes the odds of you getting into deep sleep which will give you that we call a term sleep inertia you know where you wake up like kids have it you know you wake them up you can smack them around for like twenty minutes before they get moving\nAs I Do him [laughter] and then they then they just basically are lethargic and they can't move and they're like they don't know what to do with themselves exactly yeah\nWhat I did that with Vince every morning on a question from Victoria for our producer because Victoria has this habit of she goes I'm just taking a nap\nAnd her naps last anywhere from six to eight hours and then she shocked that she can't fall asleep till midnight and like cats because you slept for during the day what would you recommend for Victoria as far as opposed to getting a nap for six to eight hours in the afternoon [laughter]\nYou know for for guys who are on schedule is like you you you you guys do you have to make their there are two options\nOne is you you you flip your schedule and you know you just start going to bed at six or seven o'clock and getting up at two or three and just living your life like that the other thing you can do is what's called a ... a split schedule where\nYou can go to bed let's say well you start your day you get up and just use a number three am\nOkay you do your morning your morning work you come home you sleep for a ... a a a few hours\nOr would they call it anchor sleep and what that's doing is that's kind of resetting circadian rhythm then you get up uh and you spend the rest of your day doing what you do and then you go back to sleep you should never sleep within about four to ... at least for if not up to six hours before you want to go to sleep\nSo you know let's do some math so if you went to bed let's say ten PM and you got up at three AM that's five hours\nIn the morning when he came home from work you should probably sleep another two to three hours let's say if you get home for you guys with time you get home ten or eleven o'clock shortly to one or two in the afternoon that would be okay that's what that's called the splits schedule\nOkay interesting customers so much and let's say and if you want to open this up if you have a question for for the good doctor or eight and eight six zero nine six two five eight six three zero W. M. A. L. in terms of trying to figure out you know what you should be doing with your sleep and actually how ...\nHow to stay restful in the wake of sometimes hectic schedules dug one of the things that\nUm I had to deal with once was an overnight schedule not like that that far beyond death some it was just literally dealing with I was working a nine pm to nine AM shift every night and that shift it was brutal but one of the things I did was I Would come home and I would sleep in a blackout room during the day so people who work night shift\nIs that important that you actually simulate like the night experience in order to sleep\nMore important than that is for for shift workers is when you leave work first the most of the hardest thing for for shift workers is you got to try to stay away from any stimulants mainly caffeine I'm within about a four hours of finishing your shift\nUm they do recommend for for shift workers to use to use caffeine during their shift and and bright lights now the big thing is and you did partially the right thing Vince is when you leave work\nAnd you're coming home which you should do is we're very dark sunglasses because your your body circadian rhythm needs to be reset everyday and it's set on on on white or basically blue UV light I see the sky so when you leave work at\nNine o'clock in the morning you the best thing for you to do is put on dark sunglasses\nAnd uh and and drive home so you don't get light in your eyes then when you get home yep dark room here plugs and go to sleep right away\nFascinating well you know what that actually creates another question for me which I asking just a moment about\nThen when you get home yep dark room earplug and go to sleep right away\nFascinating well you know what that actually creates

we have to use the term no electronics\nUm the problem is the most we're talking about like before it hits right so what is the most stimulating thing to your brain is blue light think about every electronic piece of electronics you have what's the color base in it yeah you know windows I O s\nTablets they're all blue base so blue light is very stimulating and you shouldn't use it within at

you your screen gets a little gray kind of gets a little feet below looking yeah but what that does is it removes some of that that that blue light and so it's less stimulating All right\nWe were

appropriate or she was also charged with driving up around on in a closed or an open highway um\nThis could respond and many different ways and for any illegal immigrant that was their child is

with actually knows that he is looking at stripping birthright citizenship of illegal immigrants and doing it uh it'd be an executive order so set the table here where does all of this come from birthright citizenship in the United states\nSo birthright citizenship a it's a legal doctrine that determines how a ... brat citizenship here in the United states and it traces back to the fourteenth amendment which was passed ... years after the civil war\nAnd as a specific clause in the amendment that the ah anybody born or naturalized in the u._s. or subject to the jurisdiction there are as a citizen of the United states\nSo that that's pretty claim a for for more than a hundred years\nOr basically anybody who's born with no territorial there's there's nothing I said it's considered a citizen [noise] um but there is that part of the clause and they're subject to the jurisdiction there all that um as a little broad and maybe a little vague um in in terms of its legal interpretation\nSo that's kind of where a Trump is coming from the thing that uh that that clause gives him global room to who um limit a or a reduced\nUm who is um subject to the concept of Brooklyn but isn't\nNow we've been hearing has just been thinking about this throughout the morning we've been hearing that it really hasn't been applied to illegal immigrants people who are here illegally and the and and more recently burst the tourists until Nineteen sixties isn't this really started to become a thing where it was extended\nTo people who were here illegally that there is no precedent as far as course this is really just interpretation that has been made by various departments and agencies federal bureaucracy\nThis is really just interpretation that has been made by various

lawyer\nBut but mark within it has um he's a lawyer or a lawyer just because I thought\nThere's a difference between a legal jurisdiction meaning you have to obey our laws while you're here versus
