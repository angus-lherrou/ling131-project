there were ten count that they were deadlocked on right ... you know he wants them to set at sentencing day because under the plea agreement that was reached last month in the district\nThat plea agreement was to dismiss the deadlock charges but they would only be dismissed after he finished cooperating with Robert Mueller well ts Ellis said that it's highly unusual\nManafort pleaded guilty to conspiracy obstruction charges and agreed to cooperate fully and truthfully with Mueller's investigation that's how we avoided a second criminal trial in Washington and in exchange\nThe special counsel agreed to drop the other charges against Manafort in Washington a couple of them including money laundering and failure to register as a foreign agent which usually do you just get fined for no no one ever is actually jailed for that\nAnd Mueller's team agreed that after a successful cooperation the ten bank and tax fraud charges\nThat there were deadlocked on righty dismissed well TSLs said no this is highly unusual so he wants a both teams to file a status report on Manafort sentencing in Washington he wants to discuss the Washington Agreement\nAnd to the hearing scheduled for next

he said\nQuote in this district\nThe government's decision to retry a defendant on deadlock to count is always needed a timely manner and re send and sentencing\nOccurs within two to know more than four months from entering the guilty plea or receipt of a verdict so in other words he doesn't want this to go on he doesn't want Muller to keep him and hold the sentence right over Manafort's head until after he's done cooperating he wants to sentence now\nAnd I met a obviously a Mueller's team doesn't want that because they want to hold the silver Manafort's head in order to keep him a ... a cooperating with that the water power move this guy's like I don't care who you are Bob Ballard never hernia pretty jealous baby I'm In charge this is my car ... well ... it's like he said that he said that law applies that even if\nWell my libertarian opponent and my Green Party opponent live in the district of my main opponent David Trone does not in fact he's considerably further out of the district than I Am I Am literally a couple of hundred feet away from the other line so I was in this district before the last gerrymander\nYeah I was gonna say I mean for your work Maryland is gerrymandering like specifically targeting army Hoeber and like that like it doesn't make any sense I mean think about this or were we were and we'll talk about this more this morning but in Maryland it is a is it pretty sure it's the most gerrymandered state in the entire country and built\nTo support Democrats um should you win and should Larry Hogan of course when it looks like he's going to that could change\nIt could change and I am strongly in support of it changing this district the sixth district is the one that's up to the Supreme Court for a review job it is that badly gerrymandered yeah\nLet's talk a little bit about your libertarian opponent because there are a lot of people who like libertarians are people who are independence not register with one party or another or registered as independence depending on where you live as to whether you can do that in which they\nLet let's talk about that um would appeal do you think there is for people to go to the libertarian candidate as opposed to the Republican candidate well\nI Hope that they will go with me because I Am endorsed by Larry Hogan and because I Am committed to work with him as a Republican to make this state better\nWhy do you think the appeal for a Republican governor the same people who who support Larry Hogan and happily do so yeah will not vote Republican down ballot ... what is that phenomenon well it relates back I look at it from the\nPoint of view of the last election where are the sitting Congressman John Delaney was a reasonable moderate and so people had good reasons to go with him even though they were supporting\nA governor Hogan in this particular case my opponent David Trone has endorsed Ben Jealous and is committed to the Ben Jealous extreme up points of view\nRight and that's something not not all Democrats in the state or actually willing to do that's actually among the more radical positions at asylum around in Maryland to endorse Ben Jealous or which is unusual in in any states politics to have the person who's leading the gubernatorial ticket be toxic I mean think about like legged Montgomery County he's not endorsing Ben Jealous no he's not endorsing it\nAnd you know a number of the other key Democrats in this state are not endorsing banjo and\nSome are endorsing Larry Hogan and fat absolutely so so it's it's an interesting state for that reason and and it really goes down to tax money I mean Montgomery County residents and and the and the leadership Montgomery County so the extent that if you know all the Democrats are there many of them don't want to see taxes go up\nWell let me point out I was visiting a small company a manufacturing company that is over by the fairgrounds in Montgomery County they're looking to move because of the Montgomery County taxes and of course in my role as a candidate for CD six I'm trying to convince them to move\nOut west out into the further into the district\nAnd we'll see what happens but you were losing businesses in Montgomery County because of the tax structure and that's a shame\nSo what would you change should you get elected what're you going to advocate for change which changes the main\nChanges I'm working on our transportation issues I'm working with the governor on a comprehensive transportation plan that will cover the whole district not just a four Ninety five and two

and I know what it'll take to make you feel whole again I'm Dr Alex McMillan like Milosevic and dentistry and my staff is like a family who creates a safe comfortable home for you\nOf course I could if I thought those were there was a good reason to it and there was legal press and do it but what he's doing is you're taking policy disputes turning them into legal disputes than that you shouldn't do you know we have limited resources in the state attorney general has limited resources you should focus on the problems in this state that's the message is resonating all across the state\nAnd you know bottom line is you know he doesn't want to really respond to this directly he won't debate me on TV he won't he only wants to do it in a couple of law schools um you know he just doesn't want people to really see what it's about but I think also I've been helped by the fact that we've been on the air\nAnd in in the Baltimore region particularly and that has helped our campaign tremendously because in the editor's name recognition and getting the message out\nMaybe has amount of debate you on TV 'cause he's a big sweater or something\nNo he's not a very good debate I never really had a competitor he never set a tough election and he's ever had somebody who actually has a broad background he's a career politician I'm not I've I've been a safe Ross editor of federal prosecutor I've represented business is I'm a soldier and veteran um he's been a career politician and so when your mattress together the contrast is dark\nKind of a weird thing for two attorneys to not end up actually debating each other I mean the whole point is that like you're a lawyer supposed to be like top and capable of being put on your feet and thinking through the legal arguments and here you are you have an opponent who can barely string a sentence together apparently based on your ... you know it's\nFunny he doesn't want to debate the idea was and Fox News offer the opportunity to do that and the funny thing really spend carton was happy to go on Fox and in the Baltimore County executive race Johnny oh no Democrat was happy to go on Fox\nHe doesn't want to go on Fox and you know the question to ask yourself is why what is it easy attorney general you can't take tough questions from somebody is that what are they still wants a moderator the ... easy on him is that what he's saying\nI mean I'll take questions maybe I'll give you want to one quick one you know I was on WNPR not exactly a friendly station or for Republicans or conservatives for that matter and on Tom Hall the host said I'd love to have you and Brian for all showing the debate\nAnd I said I'm happy to do it and he said well Brian ... and the staff will return my calls so even on a friendly network he doesn't want any type of air time at all to to have anybody here the contrast between us\nAnd that's interesting and now you talked about his lawsuits and he's filed more than twenty lawsuits against the Trump Administration and taxpayers pay for those losses than let's face it you know lawyers aren't cheap [laughter]\nSo so that's that's a lot of money\nBut one of his last his that he saw as is he's joined other states are suing the president about violating the monuments clause of the constitution by continued to do private for instance they stay in the Trump Hotel for president benefits from that because even though he's not running his his um his businesses anymore his sons are he's still benefits from that\nAre ... does that really resonate with people are people really um I I guess in tune to the emoluments clause\nNo and I think that's part of the problem is that he's suing over everything and anything you know the monuments clause case there's never been a case brought before so it's a new a new study there's no precedent for it it's really a political question not a legal question\nAnd the fact is that Maryland really doesn't have an interest in who staying at a hotel in Washington DC attorney general wants to do it fine\nBut Maryland attorney general has no interested in is the fact is that you should be focused on the problems in this state and again there is no division and the attorney general's office called the sue the administration division so he's robbing Peter to pay Paul he's taking people away and resources away\nFrom things that he could be working when I Do like the opioid crisis like crime in Baltimore like gang violence in Montgomery County and said he's focusing on these political issues\nAre there any is there anywhere where you would file suit and attorney general meaning is there something on your mind already where you're like you know what a lot that needs to be absolutely\nThere's two areas particularly one is on the opioid crisis you know he is governor Hogan asked him to file suit against the opioid manufacturers he recovers from the money due to their misleading practices which is this crisis and he refused news was saying and I swear to God he said\nWe don't have the resources to do this but he has a resource yet who the administration uh twenty five times the other thing I it's really interesting is that he's the administration over downwind pollution from from the northeast but he won't go after the blue states Pennsylvania New York for the damage being close to the bay of by the ...\nDown wind of pollution from from the northeast but he won't go after the blue states Pennsylvania New York for the damage being close to the bay\nOf by the water the by the run off the kind of window down or you think a guy who says his first ad is about protecting the Chesapeake Bay would actually go after states that are polluting the bay but for whatever reason that I assume it's political reasons he will go after his friends and blue states so it's all political to him\nAnd it's interesting um ... ... talk about your endorsements that you have gotten\nShore so one of the biggest indoors is you've got to the governor's indoors and that's always good to have you ever talk to each other\nBut one that's ... but I Am a ... by law enforcement all across the state and typically the Maryland state patrol or police now and they're Twenty one thousand members that has never happened for a Republican nominee for attorney general has never happened to a non incumbent if you're the attorney general the state of Maryland you should never lose the support of law enforcement he had him for years ago\nHe doesn't have also had the overwhelming majority of sheriffs in states attorneys yeah now you know again if you're the you're the attorney general to lose the support of law enforcement look if if I remember very gentle\nIn four years I've lost the support of law enforcement I'm not running

ahead of Ben Jealous how meaningful\nWine rather\nMeaningful is that up for the Republican Party broadly in Maryland\nOh I think it's extremely meaningful governor Hogan obviously has been a an extremely effective governor and has run a textbook campaign yes um you know I was talking to somebody the other day in and right now where we are you know three and a half four weeks out is reminded me of where we were in twenty fourteen\nUh where just all the momentum got got behind governor Hogan and Republicans generally and I see that same dynamic right now\nThe governor has a double digit point lead over Ben Jealous and it's interesting in a state that's so blue that they would be so in favor of a Republican governor why do you think there is that the economy and then down ticket it's all blue again\nYeah I I think the reason the Maryland is perceived as so blue is because it's so gerrymandered I don't think the right is really that blew it I think the state is more moderate or rather than liberal um so I think that's a factor and play and I think you know the other thing that I see and we've been seeing it for several months\nRight and you're open to running for an open a delegate seat in in that sixteen district to tell us about that what what is your policy agenda and why should the voters of course thank you\nMy policy agenda is to bring back the tax base in Montgomery County more people are leaving the counties that are coming Yeah Yup that's our tax base drinking how are we going to afford the things that we were grown to expect in Montgomery County and quite frankly the reason we move there if we don't have the tax base they're also looking at new ... new funding for me\nMontgomery up for public schools across the of the state that could cut over a hundred and fifty million plus from Montgomery County school budget [noise] those are our top ranked schools\nNow that's one thing that we haven't really gotten into with anyone is the schools and we've kinda gotten into transportation a little bit that seems to be a big thing for everyone because we all just sit in traffic and hate each other by the end of the day but as\nI Know what if he was going to get in my way when I'm On my way somewhere what are you going to be driving slowly and the fact that lane and I'm going to have to go around you and she always thinks to me she's right ... ...\nS a but let's talk about schools and you say they want to cut the budget if people are leaving and play devil's advocate people are leaving Montgomery County then it would go to two facts that there are fewer people fewer children in the school so why not cut the budget that just seems logical [noise]\nThe fact is more there's more money spent per student up in a Baltimore city than there is in Montgomery County and honestly spending less than they are per per student in Montgomery County and its hunting because students are leaving\nStudents more students were coming in what they're doing is they're redistributing back the money from Montgomery County which they see as the wealthiest county in the country I mean in the state and redistributing it across the state so it's not taking money because we have less students it's just taking money because they think there's the wealth and they can afford it\nWell that that that is a formula though that you see throughout the country because the Democrats in particular when they see a problem well we'll fix that money so we just throw money at it and totally\nDisregarding the fact that you know maybe an e parental involvement in may maybe parents should be involved in their children's education imagine that it's such a shocking idea one thing I Love and and I know I don't know if you could do it in public schools Catholic schools require that parents do X number of service our parents have to be involved\nAnd I think that maybe instead of throwing money at the problem maybe we get parents\nInvolved and we need to hold teachers accountable there needs to be accountability and I know governor Hoeven is working on that and I would work with him and the delegation\nThe whole teachers accountable
