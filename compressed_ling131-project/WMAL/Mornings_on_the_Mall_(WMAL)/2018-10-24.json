morning Britain um which is a funny\nBut but anyway there's a woman named most\nVery British doesn't sway observers [noise] she's a comedian now but she was on a a town that they were talking about marriage and a survey came out in England that found that a quarter or twenty five\nPercent of Eighteen to twenty four year old I think that marriage should be a temporary contract with the renewal date\nAnd so you could have it out if you decide not to renew you would have an out that we're discussing this and this woman is Kate smarts wait says um that she agrees with that she said it gives the couple\nAn opportunity to decide after Sept periods whether they stay or whether they go their separate ways at first blush it sounds really well that's just crazy\nWhat they want to join the conversation and she said I think she has a pushes the temporary contracts would encourage people to work harder at their marriages\nBecause your expiration dates coming up and it makes them more conscious that this could come to an end it's not this to infinity and beyond thing like I don't have to worry about anything 'cause we're gonna be you know married forever I don't have to worry about my problems would be great if forces couples actually have a conversation at least on a regular basis\nAbout what's going wrong in the right as well I don't want to renew because\nThis is this is why it's so it forces you to address problems that I think a lot of times couples don't address they don't they don't have these discussions about issues in their marriage in a ... and investors and they wait and that's why you see families that once the youngest graduates high school the parents got divorced\nBecause these problems have been festering for a long time but they stay together quote unquote for the children [noise]\nAt least if you had a renewable marriage contract after X number of years you would be forced to at least have a conversation about whether you want to stay married or not so I see where this could actually be a good thing [noise] eight eight eight six three zero nine six two five Tripoli six\nTo stay married or not so I see where this could actually be a good thing [noise] eight eight eight six three zero nine six two five Tripoli six three zero W I now [noise]\nAh I think this is a bad thing [laughter] I I if I have a president can I just say it soon it when I was reading this I'm like Vince is going to hate this I\nLike the government is sort of like is meddling in us and the first place why do we have to do this based on a contract\nWhy does it have to be based on that a marriage is supposed to be about a sentiment a spiritual connection and one that's it says that these two people are becoming one they're intertwined to the excellent point that when you marry two things when you marry paint when you're married to him for types of music whatever\nWhat you're doing is truly intertwining them so that they become inseparable and that should be the gold marriage not one that ultimately can be separated\nI agree with you however whether you like it or not we do have it function we do have a a device for that call divorce and about fifty percent of marriages do take advantage of that whether you like it or not sunny Seventy percent while the ... the number they throw around so I'm sure it hovers in that area goes down does that\nBut um but but whether it's whether you like to acknowledge that or not it that's a reality\nAnd um I just look at this and saying this would force couples who don't talk about their problems and then just get divorced out of resentment down the years 'cause they allowed to fester you know in the youngest graduates high school and you see those divorces they probably they may have been able to avoid that by being forced to discuss this every five years or every so many years\nThat so maybe it'll actually save marriage as jak in College Park in mourning mourning send them all hijack\nThis would be this would be a nominal phenomenal feet in the field of contract law um if it would basically most lawyers who were in the marital law which is sometimes confused with martial\nLaw [laughter] I'm lawyers would actually have to have a psychology degree as an honor to get into the marital field and\nBasically you would have two parts of the contract you would have a contract which if that was yes we're getting married this is the place this is the time this is who may or may not it and\n[noise] um this is not you know it's going to happen um\nI think it would be a good idea with marital\nContract law\nUm grant automatic custody of the children to the to the father of because of course I'm a male\nAnd um [noise] I think that it would be very good that you know that way children are involved in the renewal process as well I'm giving them a voice in the marriage\nBut all the money I'd like all the money to do but it's the way\nTo I think in putting way too much thought into this way too much thought into this you Daniel get your marriage license right you pay your fate you sign the dotted line you get your marriage license you get married the priests whoever they performs a ceremony signs that that marriage license has an expiration date a in ten years or whatever it happens to be ... and the tenure option\nWhen that's coming when that's looming boy you know we have to re newer license right do you want to go renew our license if you want to go renew your license you take defeat with five dollars or whatever it happens to be you go down your in your life is talking about about lawyers and everything else because marriage is a contract now whether you like it or not and lawyers don't have to be involved when you go get married\nSo so I think you're putting way too much thought into it trying to think that the minutia of who's going to take out the garbage and who's going to do this and who's going to do that that's not part of the ... says that's part of your relationship just like it always has been do you want to renew do you want to stay married to me or don't you on the athletes that let's go get the newspaper\nWebsite like why wait for your renewal date to have to resolve something like that if you know these are plummeting towards divorce anyway wouldn't you just pull the for the record like like like two more years and then we'll have that conversation\nBut I think it forces people who don't have the conversation to have the conversation and tell me forces you to tend to your marriage or there's a good chance it could end if you don't tend to your marriage and you don't tend to that other person if you don't have the discussion cut at five twenty three and W.

like oh it's all women and children [noise]\nYou know it's a lot of military age males as well for walking up this this direction and some questions about you know who actually composed as the people who are coming north the reason for that conversation\nI think and I think it's important to say this is to undermine the prevailing media narrative that it's nothing but people who are women and children escaping violence there's a there's a intentional effort by the press to give this the most sympathetic spin you possibly can\nAnd that's not the appropriate way to do it just handle just give us the facts talk to the people who were there of course you have us their accounting and the times that they have I looked at the LA Times loaded this week\nVery important because I mean it's

way she does she says well I'm going yeah sure no worries I just spent money and and waited and did the right thing and learned English and took the test and did the right thing that worries jumped to

one and by the way this is obviously part of many times that people have immigrated to the United states in this way but there's just so happens to be a huge caravan of people a huge gathering of people and in that gathering you know Fox News actually was interviewing people and they actually came across one of the people who was in the group and ask them\nYou know what is the composition or

Krikorian of the center for Immigration Studies guy knows a lot about the subject of captivating every one\nMarket morning good habits are mourning the reader so\nWhat obligation does America have to the seven thousand people who are walking to our border right now well\nLegally speaking if they get to our border they get to a legal crossing point and just stand in line and when they get to the immigration inspector they say the magic word of asylum we have to uh\nYou know interview them for asylum we have to take that seriously even though there's almost no chance they have a legitimate case for asylum\nSo what about looking as well start mark but what about Mexico's role in this because ... biggest typically when we talk about asylum it's supposed to be the first country you get to wear and you can claim asylum is supposed to be where that's done what's the relationship\nThere exactly that's the that's sort of a moral issue if you will the un treaty that governs the sort of thing from way back in Nineteen fifty one says the camps turn down someone for asylum just because they're an illegal immigrant bug\nThat only applies if the person has come directly from a country where they're being persecuted that's the key issue these people will be going through a thousand miles at least to Mexico\nAnd variants where they frankly are obliged to have applied for asylum Mexico\nSigned the UN treaty on this issue is has a asylum system it has asylum interviewers is granted asylum every year to significant number of people these people are not\nAsylum seekers if they get to the U.S border because they're only doing it because they want frankly you know better jobs or may be coming to join relatives neither one of which has anything to do with asylum\nSo then technically if they get to a point of entry week Ken denied them a silent or not because we have the the ... on our side correct\n... on our side correct\nTypical the typical response what I heard when the president's nationalist was I'm not a global list and that really is the biggest thing you think about the nation's industries and how it you know during World War one and two all of a sudden you had American industries\nWho went to war on behalf of the United states and converted their production on behalf of the war effort for the United states if we went to war today with Google fight with us well I Can't\nImagine that they fight a period um but Google be on our side no I Can't imagine they would they would say they were but they weren't\nI just I mean the idea that you know the idea here is very simple you know you think about like the New York times CNN's a perfect example\nOf CNN CNN viewership ... when you get to when you talk to the head of CNN the guy runs CNN International CNN America CNN en Espanol every version of CNN and you ask him who's the news audience you're serving\nThe globe so world\nAnd it's it's not it's not it's not about American interest it's about an international interest the same thing is through Google the same thing is true of Amazon the same thing is through Facebook\nAnd so there's a bit of theirs at the top of our power centers in the United states are people who are global lists people who are interested in global concerns what's best for everyone internationally so when the president stand up on that stage and he says I'm a nationalist I principally think of what's good for America first\nThe reaction can't then all of a sudden be your Hitler [laughter] like but I don't think the average American no matter what side of the person you divide a divide you fall in his thinking to themselves when you hear the president say that he wants to serve the interests of Americans first well God that sounds like despotism\nHere here's the thing yesterday when the president was in the oval office he took a question from Jim Acosta Jim Acosta asked him sir what you like to tell us what you meant when you said you're a nationalist what does that mean and the president said exactly what you're saying the president said it flat out that it means I Love this country\nThat's what it means that's what I meant when I said I'm a national is it means I Love America I Love America more than any other country and I'm going to put this country and this country's needs first that's what I meant by being a natural is of course accosted tries to then get a follow up question the president has no\nWell I had one question no fault but certainly you know I told you know\nThe other thing that was back then and I like I Love very handles it costs to correct it no where did you see them using I and for that reason I Hope it costs like he was doing the job I'm amused by the interactions and I think that's great\nBut your congressman makes use like talking about how the shopping list to say that America is better than other countries that's one of his rationales\nWhen did American exceptionalism and the belief in that become since become bigoted\nHaving pride in your country you can't do that you're not allowed to do that\nBecause there is nothing in this country to be proud of you got to take it to the ... step why did they think that because they don't believe there's anything in this country to be proud of this country is built on racism this country was built on slavery this country was built on on the on the backs of everyone but rich white men and on and on and on so if you believe that this country is inherently bad that it's very easy to come to that conclusion\nThank you as always

Cruz has been ... but\nWhat distinguishes ... from Obama speech and I and I thought about this that's a good point ... distinguishes them is that the the president this president\nGoes through a list of both accomplishments and strip forthcoming battles he's he's essentially taking an inventory of here's what this administration has done so far and here's the fights that are coming and here's what's gonna happen if Democrats retake power that's sort of that's the litany of things that Trump does it's almost like a cabinet meeting but he's he's he's holding it with\nHis rally goers the American people yeah\nSo well here's then there's some good news if you are a fan of the Trump rallies he's adding ten more rallies to his schedule he he's held sixteen rallies since Labor Day three more are currently on the schedule for this week Wisconsin\nNorth Carolina is a today North Carolina's on friday and Illinois on Saturday but he's adding ten more the uh they've not released a list of where he's going to go [noise]\nIt's interesting though because it's noted that he tends to go to these places where there are very red states um and he does this do to get the base to the polls that's the thinking is a campaign rallies because we as how come he isn't going gone to some of these states then we bring up New Jersey between Bob Menendez and Bob ... and\nWhere a lot of people are looking at New Jersey saying wait a minute there's a Republican giving a Democrat who's held the seat for a while a run for his money why doesn't the president go they're they're choosing to use their money and the political capital to get the base out and rally the base in the states that are red states hoping to get them to the polls so they'll be ten more of those\nComing off and the president he's also being very generous\nTrans suffering nine million dollars from the Trump a Trump fundraising into the Republican Party to be used during the midterms and the two weeks before election day by the way I went\nBack and I walked to the state of the union remember this year yes President Trump used the phrase we one hundred and twenty nine times\nIn contrast to first perfect person references that you were just talking about Seventy five percent fewer first person references then President Obama did in his average sort of you\nWell Trump still Hitler he's a forty three until you're ...\nYou're thinking about retirement Social Security pension investments will you have enough income to enjoy yourself and your income last for the rest of your life Hi I'm Rick ... now you can find out if your savings in ...\nTo enjoy yourself and your income last for the rest of your life ... ... now you can find out if your savings and investments can generate the retirement income you need the income you expect for your entire retirement and you can find out for free with their free retirement review\nYes you can get a free retirement review from one of the experience financial planners ...
