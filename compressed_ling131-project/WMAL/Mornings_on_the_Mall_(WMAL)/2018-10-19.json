Mexico's southern bright with Central America okay in other words to take on anybody who's calming north if they want to claim refugee status then there will be shelters at their southern border that start um\nThey ah do yesterday\nThere were they were bragging about basically this what they call a very important step that was the ambassador saying this\nThey requested the intervention of the United nations to help Mexico quote review any asylum claims from the members of the caravan that will allow us meaning Mexico to have a process by which in our border we will make sure that observing human rights respecting international law and if there are legitimate claims to being a refugee\nThose can be processed in a very clear way so that that's the beginning\nOf this um secretary of state Mike Pompeo excited about it I Know he's supposed to be actually there today talking to them about yeah all of this and not all over the ... yeah he's my company is doing everything yeah right now I'm going Saudi Arabia gonna Mexico figuring out what's going on next down these big issues with the president and obviously is concerned with\nUm they say here in the reporting from Fox that if an individual manages to invade this new system and gets all the way through Mexico across as into the United states Mexico will now which is new this is a different this is a change will now allow those people to be returned to Mexico\nWell there's a couple of reasons for this yeah go on right\nBecause they need to to get into Mexico if you're from a Honduras Guatemala El Salvador Nicaragua you can just travel into each other's countries with like a license like we used to be able to go to Canada which is sort of license or Mexico just our license now you need a passport that's all they need to get into Mexico\nThey need a passport they need they they they can't just get in with just their id also according to the un you have to seek asylum\nIn the first country that you are right and right so they legally according to the un have to seek asylum in Mexico technically from Honduras they had a secret in Guatemala they just blew through Guatemala there like you know we're not staying here and they ... they ... they're going to Mexico\nSo they have to here's a couple of reasons the president also said yesterday that he was just going to load up a bunch of planes and he was under the military at the border he said I Will militarized our border and shut it down yeah to keep these people out ... wait a minute that means we can't get in\nAnd they kind of had the corner of the market on illegal crossings into the United states they don't want to see a good thing\nGo and I love the ... whenever whenever the president brings us up or anybody look what we uh you can if the military ... you can't have the military are forcing that we're doing on the Mexican side they don't have to do it on the American side was deployed to Mexico to stop the invasion Mexicans that we can do that nothing stopping us from doing that that is\nTrue I I'm On the Mexico Mexico a kind of have to lead that'll be about it but yeah a ... co technically has to take these peanut because Mexico doesn't want the border shut down because how do they get rid of all of their people then they got to send them to the U.S and if that border or shut down they can't do that anymore well they're having the midterms are coming and people got to get voting\nWell they they seem to be helping out again I don't really understand how you could oppose this but there are of course people who do a view you've got this agreement there trying to basically say and remember there are there are allowing the United states now they're not gonna not going to put up any fight if the United states is saying hey\nWe deserve this guy's from on tourists climbing we're sending them back to Mexico Mexico so I Will take them so that that's a change because previously the United states had to adjudicate the case they needed to keep his guy\nAnd adjudicate his case before figuring out if they get deported back to his original country it was a big process Mexico for now seems to be coming to the table this is only the latest in a series of changes were Mexico is working with\nThe Trump Administration trumps the terrible presidents up you know how you can like this there like bragging about the new trade deal they're super happy about it was great\nI I think it's wonderful and it's a it's a step in the right direction there he's actually again enforcing the law and even in forcing international law that

at a formal debate\nIt was said I'm going to a forum format so there wasn't it wasn't like just us two going against each other it was basically you get a question and then we had a thirty second rebuttal\nSo does does he understand I guess I guess he doesn't that you know immigration is something that cuts across party lines it's something that was a number of and so it's not like over ... almost Seventy percent of Americans\nHave a problem with illegal immigration said don't they don't like the illegal immigration ... and so that Democrats as well as not just Republican so\nHow does this actually is not as he not get that because Democrats also there was apparently a memo that was put out to telling Democrats to stay away from the issue of immigration\nI Would say it was interesting I actually went after him a little bit because it was it was basically like going against somebody that was just reading talking points\nAnd he was saying the same party line stuff over and over again one thing you'll get for me is you will never see me basically using talking voice he'll get now no second base talking basically talking about the issues the ... the way I feel about them at a time so you know it was very interesting dealing with that\nOh I just checked I was looking back from a fight from the seventeenth Jerry Connelly was fighting back against Bob Goodlatte effort or to protect states from sanctuary cities he's like he's in favor of sanctuaries I mean this is so this is a guy who has\nZero credibility when it comes to immigration law because he's like kind of a thing you know what it's okay that states barricade the federal government from knowing whether a legal limits for being released that's not\nWhat we see what happened during his arm in Fairfax County other German of the board and we also see what's going on in Fairfax County now with regards to the sheriff as well yeah that's a relief to immigration so you know there's been a a I guess he kind of set it up this way in Fairfax County when he was in charge and now you see the fruits of his labor\nWell this is this a detailed almost hardly matter where not for the next question Jeff out as a black Republican candidate but you are accused by your opponent Jerry Connelly of racism last night how does that work precisely\nI'm not exactly sure one hundred percent but that's a lot of attack they've been going after me with they basically been trying to attack my character because he doesn't really have any issues that he can really stand on\nUm I've been going after his

Michelle Obama and they're having these close personal discussions in arenas where you pay more than you pay to see beyond say [noise]\nTo go see the Clinton right to have them talk to you and tell you about why they're victims and and how terrible their life is and and how you know it's understood she hasn't had cheated out of the President's Day she was because she has no concept of the electoral college but as as turned off\nBy that message as you might be\nThere is obviously an audience for this like people were actually paying tickets to hear that ... to sit down in front of bill and Hillary gone so there's obviously some cross section the peril that she runs into meaning Hillary Clinton and Bill Clinton when it comes to helping the Democratic party is\nWhatever they say on that stage get projected everywhere the breast picks it up and all of a sudden that's not helping I looked at I saw the New York times to the same move this like twenty four hours ago they had an op ed to this effect\nThey the opinion piece was Hillary Hillary Clinton his master class in distraction and the beef is they think quote Democrats need to be focused on the midterms and she's not helping no cars\nBecause here she is just a couple of days ago\nSaying all of this idea that everyone needs to be on civil right in the Democratic party we can't of civility until digress regain power\nAnd in fact there is a quote from Hillary you cannot be civil was a political party that wants to destroy what you stand for what you care about you know not knowing what they stand for not withstanding\nShe's basically saying Democrats can't be civil rights no civility or Eric Holder set of reason which when they go low kick them for the same exact thing and the New York times editorial page saying you know something\nIs funny people out there the sympathize with that message but\nYou may be undermining the case here among American voters who\nDon't find the idea of incivility unattractive prospect\nRight to say well this this writers also talking about you know this the what was ... she calls it the rehab tour 'cause they're trying to have their image as they cast checks and yeah they tried to come off as sympathetic Americans and and why you should up hitting on them as they catch checks for a million you know and and just keep building their empire\nBut this she says it also under cuts the Democrats positioning as the only party that really cares about the hash tag me too and that will fight for survivor because she's lugging bill around with her only sheer part is inconvenience\nCould allow someone to insist that Dr Christine Blasey Ford's testimony is credible wall down playing the allegations of mistreatment and worse me by women against Bill Clinton yeah like it just takes such a disconnect in your brain\nIn order to see those two things so differently um they said the only the only good thing they could come of this\nIs that no how no matter how long how double ... you know any of the any of these are that they all\nOf these other people is a bit Warren Kamala Harris ... brand Corey Spartacus they look appealing\nCompared to Hillary so the

let's give him some advice anyway well he's standing around he's trailing by some twenty points Democrats have already written him off\nOr how do you view that race and and quarries attempts of closing the gap will turn out to be too critical before race if it's somebody in my own party I think I'll probably have to leave it at that to be honest with you OK I mean but but this look a lot of people are watching this race certainly Republicans were hoping to gain seats in the United\nWell we are but there are there is a formula to doing that is what we talked about earlier running on local issues running on the issues that matter in the hour the Virginia\nWhen you run a type of primary campaign that alienates almost all of northern Virginia and then you don't focus on the big issues during the general it's just going to be very very tough and just be very tough and so I think mostly what we do is that we learn from our mistakes and that we nominate candidates in the future who are going to focus on the issues that impact northern Virginia and on him in Hampton\nRoads to by the way it yeah so let me stretch the south and how do you view the Republican map probably in northern Virginia ... again ... political observers partisan or otherwise have the tendency nowadays to write off northern Virginia as having any chance really a ... well that's ridiculous yeah\nIt's ridiculous because if you look at Barbara Comstock she actually won in twenty sixteen the most votes of anyone that's everyone in like two hundred and eleven thousand votes you're right right and by the way she didn't ...\nShe actually won in twenty sixteen the most votes of anyone that's eddy in like two hundred and eleven thousand votes Iraq right and by the way she didn't even focus a hundred percent of our time on transportation who's with us it's sort of in you know even though she's good on it it was her number three or four issue if we have people who actually run\nOn transportation focused getting more roads getting less tolls right so sixty six soldiers been a huge issue we haven't heard much of any ... you know we've heard from Barbara Comstock by but that's the only person we really hurt\nOn about fixing the sixty six soldiers they're talking about the green way talking about the express lanes and how to reform them short and so if you're not listen when it comes to roads you know we talk about the tax cuts right so most Latin families are going to say more than Fifteen hundred dollars because Barbara Comstock pass the tax cuts\nBut at the same time people who have to take the green way to work that's three thousand dollars a year for those families that they're giving to a company that's based in Australia right and so there are some local east you have to make just a bigger bigger impact in the national ones and if you focus on those it helps\n[noise] speaking of transportation we were talking about another Patel crossing yeah what do you say that the

Peterson run the ball well right they'll question\nThe last two wins for them at home against Green Bay\nAnd it gets a bath or is he he ran for a hundred and twenty in Ninety seven yards yeah game so you know that's what they're going to want to do I think Alex Smith has yet to really show where he can really do with a Redskins though so that's something that could be an added twist to this game and again the the cowboys defensive front outstanding or they get after the quarterback\nOr the markets Lawrence is five and a half sex they've got a lot of pressure from their front for they run a for three but the Redskins ... again at home they been able to run the ball and Peterson has been remarkable he really has\nHe has one of the conversations we always have when it comes to the Redskins his injuries so is there anyone who's going to be sidelined that can because they're not gonna play affect the outcome of this game\nI I'm not sure that I think today's practice is going to mean a lot you got some guys were bank up on both sides and for the red skins you know I think they're going to have to go with whoever's ready today is a big day for a guy like Sharm about Bruce Thompson a couple of guys who are trying to make their way back\nUp but if you if you know you're going to play with who you got in the same thing for the cowboys I'm very excited about this game is gay means a lot to the Redskins surely when this ball game for two in the division six games in a with a road game against the giants coming up next week this is it gave the Redskins must come out and play well and I think they will [noise] yeah\nWell this game is big for both teams obviously you know both teams there there's a I guess that there's there's pluses and minuses for for both here and they're both coming off of wind with their last names are pretty impressive lens and they were last games and as you said they haven't won two in a row I team is whatsoever of this year yeah so you know ...\nSome of the players the there there's really no momentum coming off the ballot last went over the Panthers was then and the Redskins have had a hard time sport in the second half of games that's

doing pretty good so far the year and last week I think those were the keys to strip of the running back the interception by Josh Norman those were the Mac those were the moment of changing plays last

brought the d._a. traveling museum or to loud county and we did that and we had people from the schools\nCome out on field trips and and they were getting to see you know what drugs can do other dangers that they cause the last potential that that is because people you know a ... because they they ... you know as a result of that so we wanted to make sure that we had a collective uh work working group together and and uh and so far succeeded if you look\nIf you look at the Baltimore Washington area just about everybody else has gone up in it overdose deaths of and I think are proactive and aggressive approach on this on our collective approach on this has actually shown that are are overdoses anger over those that have gone down\nOh what is is one of the parts of the meal is is mental health issues and mental health resources and and this is I I'm not easily not as involved in that that you are but the one thing that I I think is the big pieces missing in so many of these programs in that aspect because people turned to drugs for a reason\nAnd if they if it's if they can't get their own the right to you if you watch the open that they're going to go for prescription drugs that used to watch that they're going to go after something else getting to the root of\nThe hot as opposed to just sit down I think it's different for me it sounds a little bit of it how you were dealing with getting to the to the cause of why people are are going to be like\nWell mental health and in a in drug problems are inextricably woven together and uh and I could tell you what we do with the adult detention center for example we have people that specifically a target the folks that come in to have both mental health and drug problems that come into the to the gym and a and we work with them\nBecause we want to make sure that we do everything we can in our power while they're incarcerated to give at least the tools they need when they when they leave our facility to to\nAt least have places they can go to try to help as they go forward\nAnd we also try to educate people on this we had a panel just this past week\nWhere we had a you know you folks for mental health folks from the school board folks from the faith based community\nFormer da a people that had high level positions that were that were part of of the discussion we had a we had an attorney who who deals and mental health and substance abuse their right to talk about what he sees out there with the with his clients and uh and so yeah it's it's uh it it it it kinda transcends many many aspects of life\nOr these problems and what we try to do is collect everybody together and have regular discussions on what we can do what we can do better have community meetings because we want to know what's going on out there and how we can\nConstantly approval what we're doing so tell me about the criminal approach to this because it's interesting drugs are always an interesting environment for actually for selling crime because\nYou want people to call authorities when they're in trouble if you've got a situation where you've got a friend or family member who's just oh deed on opioids your thought process should be I Need to save their life but simultaneously is probably a lot of people out there like I don't want to get us already involved I don't want to get this guy in front of how do you balance that out how do you\nHow do you go after helping people without essentially punishing them for for these addictions but we hit it uh we\nHad it from all sides and what we try to do is we investigate every overdose or as as a drug uh issue as a drug crime in addition to the fact that we try to save lives we should all of our deputies at their ... and we said since we did that a couple of years ago said twenty lives yes there and that's before fire rescue were able to get out there so we've we've had a lot of success in that\nBut what we're trying to do is get to the distributors okay so what we try to do is develop information\nFrom that particular case and try to go after the people that are supplying these drugs we've actually had some pretty good success with that working with our our federal uh counterparts and and having federal prosecution's we actually had a\nHad a deputy who lost her twenty six year old daughter to win over do we were able to work with a da and with a this was down to Florida she was on vacation\nAnd we were able to work with a da and and the sheriff's office and Orange County they put together a comprehensive case yeah and uh we're able to charge a federally in addition to the local charges they had been in Pennsylvania and he actually got life in\nPrison somewhat more ... so much more prevalent as it is it heroin or fat now\nWhat what you're seeing it as sort of has been involved in what you saw was a was a a lot of people were taking opioids and they would get hooked\nThen they couldn't get the opioids right more then they go to heroin okay and then they start with that and then they started listening to heroin was ... yes it's about fifty times more potent than the heroin and then ... came into it which is about fifty times more potent than the sentinel\nSo yeah and that's elephant tranquilizer and I actually had somebody when I gave it their presentation or that came up to me she was a veterinarian she's\nThe federal so yeah that's elephant tranquilizer and I actually have somebody when I gave it their presentation or they came up to me she was a a veterinarian she says you can't use that that example of carpet and all being an elephant tranquilizer anymore\nOr in your presentation and I said why not she says because it's killing ... says they stopped using it as I said well so these are the kinds of things that\nPeople are on their body let's let's hold on to you if you don't mind I Want to ask you more about this including where this is all coming from I think a lot of people want

focusing on because it is that bin Laden counting the number ... over and over\nAnd had the magic that you seem to live down here [noise]\nThe opioid yes but I wouldn't\nI Want to know have you seen a decrease in any other crime that you can maybe a tribute to Europe proactive operation here I can still be\nLike what we've seen a a a a decrease across the board of violent crimes uh it says it was really since I've been on the job of actually seen it constantly going down I don't know how much that's connected to this uh specifically\nBut uh but I can tell you that the crime rate overall has been continuously going down\nAnd I think everything that we've tried to do and loud county is is we try to do it from a comprehensive approach a slot just one thing that works is not just arresting people it's not going out there it's educating people is trying to prevent what's going on out there\nIt's having committed immediate community forums discussing what's going to let the public know what's going on and how they can engage and help us out that I think uh I think that comprehensive approach and everything that we do is what's really helping us or reduce our crime rate and reduce or opioid\nProblem as sure as you were saying before one of the things you focus on when you encounter someone who's overdosed on opioids is how did they get them in the first place like where did they come from and as you investigate that question what's the answer where are they coming\nFrom about what we're seeing as fat little is coming into actually a lot of it's a produced in China that actually comes and people get on the dark Web they're able to order it through the dark Web and then it gets really just mail to them we can get straight people get straight at all from China but\nAlso a lot of the the sun all this going toward to Mexico was getting mixed with the heroin and so we see and most of the people that are getting heroin that's laced with ... is coming over the border from Mexico that's right that's right\nAnd this is something the president obviously very interested in tackling fixing that problem which is a huge issue how\nDo we not know that what's in our mail then I guess that's the question that bothers me is how do you not know that this is coming basically being delivered kid there\nMay not know that what's in our mail that I guess that's the
