order to keep the borders safe\nIt adds another six point eight billion for security infrastructure including border surveillance technology and additional detention space for illegal immigrant families which we need because we know that they're just getting we're putting them on greyhound's and sending them anywhere they want to go yeah I I this\nIs this border wall built by a by Kevin McCarthy ... the the thing that really stands out about it for me and this last week we talked 'em to the center for Immigration Studies there mark a Korean mark was saying that he just thinks Kevin lax\nReally stand out about it from me and this because last week we talked\n'em to the center for Immigration Studies that mark a Korean mark was saying that he just thinks Kevin locks credibility to congressman lashed credibility on this question that he feels like he's not been strong on immigration but\nHe wants to be speaker of the house and the last thing he needs as President Trump burning out there and saying that he'd be an inadequate speaker of the house\nThe president seems to have endorsed him behind closed doors and basically said that he thinks Kevin gonna make a great speaker this as Jim Jordan is still running for that job and is considered far more conservative than McCarthy here's McCarthy saying well here's a showcase for you this border wall funding bill right exactly\nHe told us he had no intention of endorsing the Republican\nSo he's knocking on doors are open despite the fact that he likes them better and he seems to be better for Montgomery County than Ben Jealous well that's all changed over the weekend I like it has now indoors to Ben Jealous this news coming to us this weekend um but he says he won't campaign against Hogan\nSo he's still it's kind of a weird thing he wants it both ways jealous is getting his tell will tear he's losing twenty points by twenty points right now to Larry Hogan I guess endorsing jealous but won't actually campaigned for him\nTo say the most important thing last and that story and you and you mentioned it but with the most important thing and that story is that there are Democrats in Maryland who are realizing that even socialism is a little bit too expensive too much that that to me is is the important part of this story there are people in ... in Maryland right now going to wait what\nWell this is sort of weird thing is I thought OK well there must be a really compelling reason for I get to do this\nAnd this is what the Washington Post says about his decision listen to this why get said he decided to endorse after numerous discussions with jealous and his running mate does he turned ... about the candidate stance is on the issues of\nSchool funding bringing Amazon's next headquarters the Montgomery County and taxes then the next scraps of this\nHe said that although jealous is quote still evaluating on the tax things\nThe candidate has softened his position on school funding formulas and has indicated he will honor any deal to state negotiates the land Amazon okay so he's happy with\nJealous apparently being happy okay with whatever the state negotiator at on Amazon bringing them to Montgomery County\nBut the tax thing which is the thing that I like it as far as like I don't want him to raise taxes he apparently is still a question mark whether or not jealous already taxes and I'll have to to pay for everything he wants to do for Maryland which are again socialist programs regarding health care and schools and everything\nWell I'm I don't understand what the disconnect is because all that free right so I don't understand how that's a problem when he was talking about taxes it's all free yeah the rich people are going to be taxed well you know the money the billionaires and the ... those are the people who are going to pay for it and that's Montgomery County\nNo they're not really there's I'm like lick Richard Branson lots of people who don't live in Maryland who's actually\nI'm a Hogan ... spokesman Scott ... us told the post that luggage supportive jealous is quote he's right it's a half hearted endorsement ... needs to explain to everyone what positions he actually flip flop on flip flopped on and what you'll see caught\nIn order to get like like it's ... and that is true you should explain it but ... says campaign says he changed nothing\nDoses campaigns like oh we didn't do anything I can uh this is Kevin Harris senior advisor to jobs\nI Can't explain why Mr like it was ever confused about Ben's positions but they haven't changed the Amazon deal with poorly negotiated tuition free college is the right thing to do and schools everywhere should be fully funded including in Montgomery County not at its expense those always weren't still are our positions\nTo the schools should be fully funded in Montgomery County but not at six Spencer someone else is going to pay for the um we're back someone else is going to pay for it it's all free and you don't flip flop if you actually hold both positions waving their standards you know we didn't change we almost positions\nSomebody is six twenty two W a male

treated her with great show you how do you seem to be saying that she lied about a ... you know what I'm not going to get into it because we won it doesn't matter\nYeah and that and they gave him so much grief I mean the whole point was on that stage where he was like laying out the inconsistencies in her story where did you go I don't remember how did you get there I Do remember right he did that and the press ran with this Trump mocks her right well I don't know I mean it's not worth a ... and her story\nMendez seems kind of important when you're questioning the credibility of the man she's accusing well\nShe's untouchable because we believe we believe heart rate we believe all women\nExcept when you know it's a Democrat otherwise they believe all women and the press just laid out the facts and and he took a lot of grief for that but she's right well and I think what they had a problem with it was at a rally\nAnd the way in which he said that they have a problem with the way in which he says it ought to stay that is the central beef is and it is it's the way in which he says I don't know that he was kind of ... heard that they he wasn't treating her lack of memory with respect\nTo I guess that makes sense right well that's all the whole point I mean it's like it's like the story of the Trump presidency the ruling class doesn't like Trump because he's vulgar\nAnd he's on presidential those are the things he they don't like about him right and that drives them crazy it doesn't even matter what his accomplishments are and we're going by the way we will be talking about those accomplishments coming up because of the big list of them are out there but\nThe reality is that's the thing they're obsessed with ... is the way he presents himself and and that's it that's the sum total measuring the president in the eyes of his critics\nAnd here's another one here's another example of that of that exact thing the president's been speaking well of Kim Jong on lately saying things about like his love and how we trust him to the president being questioned about how he trusts Kim Jong\nIl than I Do trust him yeah\nAnd things about like his love and how he trusts Sam was the president being question about how he trusts Kim Jong them\nThan I Do trust him yeah I trust them that doesn't mean I Can't be proven well I think trust is well first of all I didn't trust him I wouldn't say that you would not be able to tell you right here on sixty minutes\nSo in other words he's he's got he's got a sort of closeted position on the side and his public faces like oh yeah we're all love and hugs and stuff but what's what's really transparent to any thinking person including Leslie stall despite the fact that she won't admit it out loud\nIs that she knows that she's doing this as a part of a move to convince Kim Jong noon to play ball right\nWell do do you think she does of course she does she's she's like thinking adult and if she doesn't she's

like this causes amnesia here's\nGauge for their stand up guy from selling eating in\nA picture postcard days mild nights right now boy makes you forget what winner in D.C has in store\nThey didn't rush Cam Newton hard because they wanted to keep him in the pocket of that final Carolina drive and knew knew he would have time to throw it he'd pick them apart move the ball all the way down to the sixteen your life then the Redskins change tack\nInstead of slowing down to pass rush to keep them in the pocket they said no way we're going after him and they kept him with the past rush and the blitz and all those last free throws by Carolina there were all incomplete or the Redskins defense preserve the victory\nWell the Redskins defense got a big lead from Josh Norman really showed up yesterday forcing to turn over one an interception wanna force fumble and perform debt incredibly on it for a Redskin seems that it could use it\nJosh Wurman was at real risk\nOf having his his cute factor his popularity I guess in Washington flipped on his head he's always been one of the more popular Redskins players because of his personality because of his play but he had an interception says twenty sixteen\nAnd that's not so bad just because a lot of quarterbacks didn't throw his way a lot but this year heading into this game\nHit the quarterbacks throwing his direction how to pass or reading that was only two points less than perfect ... two points less than perfect\nYes and if he matched the New Orleans performers this week then all of a sudden that that would have flipped on him instead he was responsible for a couple of turnovers and played very very well\nDidn't listen about Adrian Peterson we knew he had a a dislocated shoulder and he's had problems with his me he was questionable as to whether he was even going to play and he did a phenomenal job he coach ... even said I Can't say enough about what he did today playing to the painted the shoulder and then he ... he is\nBut my question is you know it's great that he's doing that but our our ... do we do we run the risk of having him getting really injured down the road because you know he's playing through the pain and not letting things he'll\nDo you have that problem down the road and we may be being ... many foolish a penny wise and pound foolish whatever the saying is\nMary that's a great point the problem is Elizabeth is going to play running back then a lot left\n... they've got a lot of running back to an angel reserved now that they were counting on yeah Peterson did play with a lot of pain there was a play where he round the ball wide left or just before he went out of bounds of small defensive back came over to push 'em out of bounds\nThat normally in that case he still form that defensive back you'd make a statement have some fun punish the guy\nBut he didn't stick his arm out first it far be kept the tucked in like a chicken wing and that told you that his shoulder really was bothering him but what it was time to run between the well it was like you said Mary he was magnificent most of his yards came after he was initially hit by tackling\nThat's where I kept going yeah it's a big sign yards after contact a tremor I one of the things that really stands out and his his statistics as they relate to these Redskins wins week one he's averaging three point six nine uh when he averages one pointed to yards for attempt and a law against the calls\nAnd then go back to Green Bay now he's a six point three two yards on average ... New Orleans right in the last one point five then to Carolina where he's averaging five point seven one yard and a victory Adrian Peterson is the commonality between all of those victory and his performance has been critical this year\nIt is but I'll tell you his performance on the good days have been better than pretty much any other back would have gotten where members of your bits of wine is banged up they've had a couple of different positions where the backups are in their starting now yeah and so so the fact that he was able to get what he got was actually a real credit to his toughness\nNow he's such a such a big late edition and and people thought he was done no not at all\nSo the fact that we get what he got was actually a real credit to his toughness\nYeah now he's such a such a big late edition and people thought he was done no not at all he's got a lot more to go out and sort of ... thank you for ever really appreciate it or there's got to try to talk to you next week hopefully another victory under under our belt seven forty three O W male\nWhen it comes to automotive mobility you'll lose the ...
