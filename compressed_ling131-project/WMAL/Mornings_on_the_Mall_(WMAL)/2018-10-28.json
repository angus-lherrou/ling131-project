M. A. L.\nI'm Gloria here's been joining us today\nBack Sunday magazine on do you ever feel\nI'm Gloria hairs and joining us today for discussion on breast cancer risk factors and the treatments that are available is Dr Anita ag wall whose expertise and research and breast cancer and he wants\nOr traction of nipple and swelling of the lymph nodes into an exit loss any of the signs he should go seek attention of your doctor\nDr I go well what are some of the common treatments for breast cancer so the treatment of breast cancer is ... because the breast cancer is very very heterogeneous foot differs from patient to patient and as well as tumor within itself\nSo the treatment modality of included are surgery medical treatment which has chemotherapy or hormone therapy radiation and plastic surgery\nSo so he can be either taking the lump out which we call low impact me\nOdd removing the whole breast which is called ... me along with lumpectomy in ... to me the surgeon may have to do your lymph node execution also to find the stage of the breast cancer for the medical treatment includes chemotherapy\nHormonal abolition and also they we have new target and want to collect data base I can talk to you about medical treatment right now because there are several chemotherapies again the treatment depend on the stage of the breast cancer like the CIA yes as I mentioned before is a state does Ito\nWe do not give chemotherapy because the prognosis of the cancer of the DC I guess is\nNinety eight percent of the patient will survive without chemotherapy my greatest each one to for\nSurvival goes worse than the stage for stage one may or may not need chemotherapy stage two three and four usually need chemotherapy and their videos agent of the chemotherapy available\nPointed the hormonal Appalachian if the team has estrogen and pro just from deceptive positive we do give her more than like\nAmongst suffering and pre menopausal and other treatments in post menopausal woman which differ from the pre menopausal so as I said it's very heterogeneous can depend on patient and the cancer characteristics\nMen from city Asians those who have lumpectomy will need ... to the whole breast but those patients who had mastectomy meat or may not get tradition depending on the characteristics of a cancer\nRate of stage for usually because they have gone out of the site of the primary site usually do not need surgery but need chemotherapy and sometime radiation stage for the survival is poor only five to ten percent of the patient will be alive\nAfter ten years of the treat them and so it's again as I mentioned before it's really important to have screening test and earlier we can detect cancer but that is the survival\nI'm just sitting here thinking as we mentioned earlier it's a rare for men to be diagnosed with breast cancer how do we detect breast cancer in men with the common way\nVery difficult [noise] um usually when the men or this a mass in their breast that's number one number two when they go to their primary care doctor they noticed that the breast of bigger\nA which is called got an ACL mass tia sometime men can also know to sniff part of this charge there is a no screening tests for men pressed\nSo it sort of difficult to diagnose men breast cancer and usually diagnosed later stage because we do not pay at the men do not pay attention to their pressed as women do [noise]\nAnd then for the women who are in getting back to women with breast cancer how important talk a bit about nutrition and prevention um you know even before realizing that you may have breast cancer what can we eat or how can we eat to prevent\nCancer is that is that a such thing that exist [laughter]\nVery controversial but it's always good to have a healthy active lifestyle and keep your BMI ended the normal range obesity has been known to be number one\nLifestyle causing breast cancer above BMI above thirty five is a major risk factor for breast cancer for eating healthy nutrition does help taking less calories\nLess fat no smoking\nSo Dr Agarwal talk to us a bit of ...\nDigging less calories\nLess fat no smoking\nSo Dr Agarwal talk to us a bit about how important it is to have family or friends or a support group um to share you know in the healing process going through the treatments with one who's been diagnosed\n[noise] family support is very important and number patient population specially ... be need more family support than in general population because of their own situation I'm\nKeeping positive attitude pow pow emotional help\nThey need to him she somehow emotional how family have support\nFor a while can you share with us a bit about the various services and resources available to veterans with breast cancer\nSure and Washington DC ... medical center we have ... tumor board we're much dimmer down at the physicians like colleges surgeon plastic surgeon radiologists edition and colleges\nResearch coordinator best navigator on a president would present the keys and come up with a plan for the patient all together and then the patient maybe get a call the patient schedule the biopsy schedule all\nImportant appointments for the patient like cats can Maddie port and how the patient to go through the whole process we do have a really beautiful woman health clinic where patients is taken kit as one person\nThey don't have to run from one place to the other to get their treatment\nWe do have breast cancer support group which meets once a month we do have family support group which also meets once

pain free but all of a sudden I started having pain in my hand I Know what is this is weird but then I realized that I had run out of my district formula and I went off of it for several weeks and the minute I started going on and it took about\nSeven maybe eight days the pain went away\nWow crazy isn't it and that's all you know something's working right if you stop and the health issues come back well there's your answer\nThat's the best test that anyone can listen to it especially if you're on the fence\nHe'd go I Wonder if this is really for me and what I Would do it to the next time you give up the number to have people orders it's go ahead and order it I Know you mentioned that the risk free opera and go ahead and try yourself and stay on it for five six weeks and then if you're

people listening most likely taking the wrong type of vitamin D supplements joining us today is our good friend Dr Michael thank you so we've been talking about his fast melt vitamin D three formula and shipping is what you're saying is that most of us are deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nWhat I'm saying it's a multifaceted problem where one\nWe're not getting enough vitamin D three hundred system ... vitamin D trees are responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly it surprised me because of medical school\nWe learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bones we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right down for the first twenty something years I practice I never prescribed vitamin D I just didn't think it was necessary and then in the early to thousands of the study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred and studies\nShow that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that should be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on vitamin D for from the U.S navy okay\nSo I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women who were studied and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was due to the melanoma cells skin cancer so I'm reading study you know I I kind of hot as right there and went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deaths of shift\nIn the equator and all over the world and they're getting into her but you know you're young raise and and they're developing skin cancer\nBut then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers and inside and I went home I\nThought it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream ... three formula help with that\nYet critical if you're someone that's over fifty especially\nYou're seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body is starting to slow down\nFor it's it's kind of a cleansing is that people kind of feel like they're getting clumsy physically and then it's a lack of flexibility you start to stiffen up and you feel at night especially here in bed\nRolling from side to side you wake up with your knees are hurting your legs are restless your shoulders hurt that said this in a setting in that's associated with a lack of vitamin D three my formula so if you're someone listening right now and you're having a lot of the joint pain Bowling Green muscle pain\nFibromyalgia I Would say start on my formula like immediately and start taking one or two of my vitamin D three's a day for the first week or two to get your thoughts as quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that seem to it but you're taking a lot of sugar and gelatin in wax my thing is it's not what you can put your body absorb\nWell I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because\nBody absorb when I Want to talk more about what happens when people start taking your fast melt the three formula\nBoy that's a really good question because the first area that vitamin D seems to affect your energy your sleep your outlook your mood and then after being on it for a while your core strengths will come back so for those who have slowed down you're going to feel more energy like physically and so it kind of like feeling a little bit younger Christ\nAnd who wouldn't want that way and maybe you can share again for those that may have just joined us some of the

five I'll give it to you again\nIt's one eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days and that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress and Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula\nCan help us in the battle against stress I'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium factors in I mean\nUh I I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nToo we are talking about stress and we're talking about dress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could lift museum is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is making it seem so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five bio chemical reactions that neither was involved with it it's almost like a hormone wow and for example with low levels of magnesium\nYou're going to be very important factor in life you would say so\nIn fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium the fish and say okay you have um attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease caused the patient diabetes fiber at my job high blood pressure down the migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's not do this and the list goes on and on and on\nThis this is associated with a lack of magnesium in the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so I think that really mess around with no what happens is that you need the museum in your body in order for the count them to be absorbed\nSo it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first one which is calcium\nThat's right they work in combination with each other [laughter]\nThere's many more practical applications of this count back formula first of all like I said you drink so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use the foreigner clinic\nIs for people who are under a lot of traffic and it can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble flip it really because it relaxes you do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the deaf you drink a cup of the comics formula\nInteresting\nThough the other thing that it's really really good for people who are in pain [noise]\nOkay I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you in that case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is including arthritic Taipei and fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of area that like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you've named seemed to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person had a magnesium deficiency specifically magnesium they don't absorb their food so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this uh\nSo they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know this might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired and that is a real gradually overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more\nGrass or whatever right that that's what I Would think that what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nAnd that started to take the count them out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting a lot because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old you and your body's actually starting to manifest\nAt all do too simple lack of these nutrients\nOut there and let me tell you and it is the problem and being a doctor researcher it how do you get into the system\nThe formula we have the ... formula is fantastic because it's a powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a ... ticket to sort of this powder and mix it in any drink that's cut down that's what it is really incredible because it actually goes right into your blood stream\nOr I this is probably a good time folks if you want to get a free book about calcium and magnesium and try Dr ... formula there is a special toll free number to call\nIt's one eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five ... is a unique blend of calcium and magnesium the gets absorbed into your bloodstream so you can

five I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred eight to seven one to zero five\nWell if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael on the phone today and he's telling us about stress and\nHow important it is to ensure that you've got the proper nutrients in your system specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead happens gradually over time it's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their body\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiencies are not like a water main break in or you have written notice the right to their little trips little leagues here and there and so we have is that came to the fact where a person to start to go downhill just a little bit at a time the up to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nTo pick his you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit about back pain\nCalcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually half the translators and the nerve and when you take this combat formula many times they will calm your back pay well I Know I write a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back and I always try and everything and I took out the next formula\nI drank it and I couldn't believe the difference within about a half hour functional again not wasn't completely gone but I I drink it over ten day period it completely alleviated the problem\nNow what about heart disease\nHeart disease is something you have to watch out for both ... and going down the genetic line yeah and if anyone have any history of heart disease or you didn't even have bypass surgery you should be on the comics formula and I can't say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing we talked about arthritis what about joint pain\nAnd say that without enough emphasis because it's something that will completely give you a new lease on life\nIsn't that amazing when you talked about arthritis what about joint pain well\nThey arthritic joints really respond to this and I recently gave a candidate to lady was suffering from fibromyalgia where she was having pain in just about every joined your body can be Internet could be in her elbow and um and I gave it to her one week in a fire in the next week\nAnd I swear I did not recognize her really just that the lady that was sixty four years old and the first time I saw her she looked like she was\nEighty four years old and a week later\nShe was bright she had a beautiful smile her eyes were gleaming and I I honestly had to ask my wife who this lady was and and sure enough she was the one who took a week of the formula account max formula\nAnd um she said she got a really good week of sleep or the first time in years wow and that her pain was much better and she ordered three more cancer made\nI don't want to go and watch the real ... and now that I have a better I just really fall in love helping to echo very accomplish when when I Know that I help somebody we know that you can kind of lethal selling on one

A. S. T. retirement approach free attacks well is that the same as a ... well it has some of the benefits of ... but it actually has additional benefits as well so that's why\nYou know it's different and it's better and its special and we have it ourselves we eat our own clicking\nAnd you have to ask yourself how does this pertain to me\nAnd we had a gal and call us this week that said she's about ready to retire and she says you know what\nI thought wait too much money in my T S P account I mean I have yet that's all I find it and as I got you know seven hundred thousand dollars in there and I'm concerned that my taxes are going to be higher when I retire than even when I've been working so I have no tax deductions and now she thought they want to start moving some of that money into the restaurant a G\nA at even now she said she wanted to start and so\nI Am sixty four started putting Iraq about eight thousand dollars a year you know I'm not a huge amount but eight thousand dollars a year and she wants to find that for the next\nTen years and guess what she's able to then take out of a over nine thousand dollars a year so she's taking out more than what she's putting into taking it out tax free and not only that her family has than a death benefit that's attached to that South anytime along the way she passes away they're going to get an additional\nHundred and twenty five thousand a hundred and fifty thousand depending how much she put into the account that fire so it works really for any age\nSo she finds that for for ten years but then she was able to take the money out for as long as she ... and then one of the great things about the strategy is that no matter how long you live I don't care if you go to a hundred and five\nThey're still going to be a death benefit that that benefit typically is more than your initial investment that you put in some people it in\nA a thousand dollars a year for ten years eighty thousand dollars I can tell you no matter what age that you actually pass away the death benefit to your beneficial is going to be more than your deposit eighty thousand dollars and that's going to go tax free\nTo your uh beneficiary whether that be your spouse or or your children or whomever you name a so it multi purpose is your money ... and that's one of the great things about the strategy that's why we are you down to the radio here and we talk about it every week because we just haven't found anything different or better out there are two really\nHelp people to kind of round out their portfolio in such a way that they're providing multiple income streams I mean when you do a retired you do want to have a number of legs to your retirement screwed stool and\nAn raft certainly should be a or could be one of those legs so we want to get you the book it to the ... information and get your questions answered\nThe number to call or taxes one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nThe I get your questions answered the number to call or text is one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free raft strategy said his plan or checks and your name female and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven by phone call or text and provide your main female ends at shows a fix it by force fours of each of us have I wanted\nTo remind listeners that the rats tragic isn't something weird or strengths that David ... created and we did not design this concept this is something that rich people have used for years and years and years and yet now but it's actually over the past Fifteen Years this package such that the everyday person can really engage in it\nAnd yet it goes by iris guidelines that had been that had been around since the Nineteen eighties half are different hammer camera they actually govern how this actually works with a year retirement planning and so it's an exciting concept that we engage in our solve all of our children have\nWrapped accounts and we're glad for them because we know that are going to be set for the future\nOr you know reading the book you reference of course my wife by the way it is in the acronym queen okay she came up with raft and the triple the program and all the acronyms that we use but one of the things that I really liked that you use in the book and\nAnd from time to time here on the program is pom pom right now my wife is a former cheerleader so I guess pom pom was a natural thing to watch for pom pom standing for plenty of money peace of mind and I really didn't appreciate that until I read an article recently\nUh about it was a survey that highlighted a some important information for employers okay because\nThey did a recent survey and they found that uh people that lose sleep a fall from time to time over something that they're worried about six Seventy seven percent of them are worrying about ...\nMind money right right so can you imagine that a\nThird about forty nine percent of baby boomers are younger boomers ages fifty to sixty three I'm admit to that money was keep them awake\nAh and ah so Eighteen percent of all survey responded submit\nTo being wake full in the wee hours about saving for retirement so not just\nMoney worries about about how I'm going to make the bills necessarily but also about my future and a research has found that people that lose sleep are more prone to depression and anxiety so the ultimate a bottom line here is that it's actually been tied to a higher degree of risk\nSo when you have your future when you have to you a pom pom plenty of money peace of mind you're able to sleep better you're able to live a better quality of life and certainly that typically will involve having a in place multiple income streams when in fact she did retire\nThat's exactly right and and that's why we want to get information into your hands the number to call or taxes eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five\nTo get your free rap

seven day we\nWent over an illustration based on a forty year old and somebody in their sixties now I Want to talk about somebody in their fifties that gave us a call at fifty three year old guy he wanted to set aside ten thousand dollars a year for ten years and\nRetire at age sixty two [laughter] I was like okay that sounds great it's a ten thousand a year and then the projection as he'd be able to take out around eleven thousand per year for the rest of his life it tax free\nNow people say sometimes how in the world cannot happen\nYou know this is a formulated specifically and specially for this a strategy\nYou know I we can go over the numbers we can teach you actually how it works and how we can provide that kind of return to keep in mind also this is all linear if that fifty three all want it to instead to twenty thousand dollars a year into the account instead of\nTen thousand dollars a year then that returned at age sixty three\nA hit distributions are going to be around twenty two thousand dollars per year you see so we have some people that will call us and we'll go over the numbers at ease in several different ways we might provide for five or six different types of illustrations and you know what would happen here or there and\nAnd also you know what if we decide to provide an illustration or you know open on these accounts for the white\nAnd also the husband

you just want to hop on a scooter you don't mind that risk a try it out there was other companies out there that offer the same thing\n[noise] heard\nThat VW I become to cc areas busiest airport ah I've actually\nRead the contrary to that I read and heard that Reagan is even\nBusier has more flights in and out no actually let me correct that there\nLet's pretend that you\nLet's pretend that you have a home that's worth four hundred thousand dollars\nAnd the time has come for you to sell that condo townhouse single family house and you've decided that you need to buy something that's got four bedrooms two and a half as two car garage [noise]\nCould be an Herndon could be in South Arlington could be in downtown DC Europe Montgomery County could be anywhere the stories the same you need to get the equity out of the first property in order to buy the second one how can you best be served in this process\nSo that you can get top dollar for the sale your property but you don't pay\nAs much as you have to for the one you're buying that sounds too good to be true doesn't it sounds like something that's not quite right how can you sell your home for the most money and get get a deal and the other property [noise] well here's how\nUltimately want to be in a position to buy non contingent which is why you don't want to own two properties 'cause you don't want to not be able to sleep at night put in positive you want to be able to sleep at night right where you you don't want to wake up or have your wife wake up\nAnd have her say what have we done we bought a house and we still have to sell this one and it's not selling and every day to click buy your life becomes more miserable\nIt's like owning a stock that keeps going down every morning you check the stock and it's like I don't know if I should sell or not I don't know if I should sell or not it can just eat away at your mind and your soul [laughter]\nWe don't want to be in that place in life and now there are some who say I don't I'm not really worried about that 'cause I can afford to find you're in a different category than the most of of the listeners that we have out there\nYou may be able to buy and then sell and carry the difference in his no issue to you and and I think that is the perfect place for any buyer and seller sore sellers slashed by her cell or to be in because\nYou really aren't under any pressure know ideally you still want to do the best job of managing your money [noise]\nUh but you balance that against other things as well if you have to sell\nThat is what I Want to talk about if you have to sell to get into another property\nYou want to put the property on the market at a point where you're going to get it under contract with multiple offers for above list price that's your goal right [laughter] so preparing now to put your house and the market and putting it on the market when there's the least amount of supply\nK which is going to be the middle of February when it's cold nasty outside it doesn't look very pretty you think gosh it doesn't seem like the right time I should wait till may it's too late may is too late the market is softening in may market is hot\nLook at him and tore middle of February it's at the nature of of him and tore in January and February every year and yet more\nHomes sell for more money and less time at that point in time starting the middle of February up to the first week of may year after year after year after year I did all the research I did all the research I went back decades in time I've got the statistics to verify what I'm saying is true\nYou may hear from agents that there are two markets every year the spring and the fall that is not true the fall market is a die hard\nIt is a dead look at the market now look at the number of listings on the market which is actually short there's not that many we don't have a large supply of listings and yet listings are sitting because most buyers aren't thinking of buying right now [noise]\nAnd many buyers have to sell in order to buy and if they can't sell their house they can't buy so you're left waiting hoping\nSome houses will sell right away of course if their price correctly maybe even a little lower than we are the market would be just four months from now or four or five months ago\nYou put your house on the market in the middle of February it will sell you walk in confidence if you have a good real estate agent and I highly recommend that you interviewed before you're hired an agent\nPlease consider the arc Stewart group at long and foster when you go through that process give us a chance to tell you what we can do how our systems work why we've sold a hundred and sixty homes this year why we have been so successful\nBy God's Grace we are successful we work hard we employ many systems to attract buyers over three hundred and fifty different websites when you put your house and the marketed in the middle of February you want to disseminate information and drive traffic to your property in droves you want people to claim or to come in\nYou don't want to rely on old outdated methods for marketing your home that really don't sell houses like open houses [noise]\nCure it facilitates traffic but one percent of homes sell that way most agents really brag about how to use those broker open houses big Ole wasted time folks\nI'm going to have twenty five agents for my company come in I'm going to serve them pastries maybe a glass of a bubbly or something to give away a gift certificate at Nordstrom if they come by just to get them to come by attracting the agents who may be free\nLee or something to give away a gift certificate at Nordstrom if they come by just to get them to come by\nAttracting the agents who may be free to come by to look at the property maybe they'll go back and they'll tell their buyers about it [noise]\n... buyers find real estate these days is a because real estate agents called or buyers and say hey I found one that'll work for you maybe on the quiet listing for a house that's not on the open market that will work case in point I've got a home on west Patrick in Alexandria, Virginia\nThis list at just under nine hundred thousand that's not on the open market and won't be until February but we're going to have a brokers open where the only way people can get in is if they come through the brokers open and that will be the agents to give them a chance to see the house off the market that's where a brokers open mics that's open market I never and\nI said never with a capital N. E. V. E. R. never sold a house no zero in my thirty one years by having a broker open houses feeding non working agents food so they can combine offered them gift certificates just to attract them to come by and hopes that they might win something\nI never sold the house by doing that\nIt's an outdated method back in the seventies when there were no pictures they only way to get in was that an open house or brokers opened a different story\nPhotos are abundant they tell the story for plants tell the story buyers get the information buyers drive me and my team bees are the four that I Want to see\nI was out showing property last weekend to buy or coming into Boston in personal referral\nAnd this is exactly what happens they sent me the nine properties that they wanted to see we get fed them everything that was available they told me which ones they wanted to see two are already under contract\nThe other seven we went out and looked at\nWho's in control the buyer is right [noise] okay what am I trying to say about this whole process of buying and selling if you've got to sell and you want to buy\nYou might consider buying on a contingency basis in January when there isn't that much inventory but there certainly are not as many buyers and put a short term contingency on that because most sellers at that time of year are going to give you\nA contingency to sell your property because you're you're not competing to get into what they have to offer you might even consider buying in December when\nNobody's buying put it in a sixty or Seventy five day contingency even if you're buying contingent at that time you can negotiate a great price\nYou're now under contract to buy the home of your dreams you put your home in the market when you know you're going to sell it\nFifty five percent of our listings sold in ten days or less last year more this year than that at a hundred percent of list price my confidence in our capabilities to make that dream happen for you is Supreme\nChef's time has come for you to buy and sell and make this work and to make that process work so that you can compete get home that you want to have the the benefits of it real guaranteed by that attracts more buyers to your home bring your house to the market at the right time and the ... group at long foster\nIs one real estate group you should consider college today eight hundred nine hundred Ninety One oh four that's toll free eight hundred nine hundred Ninety One oh four eight hundred nine hundred Ninety One for give us a call there or go to Eric Stewart group dot com you can shoot me an email that Eric and Eric Stewart group if you've got a question\nAnd don't forget our how to sell your home for top dollar seminar\nWill be repeated in November how to age and your best place seminar will be repeated in November we had a large crowd at both events in a in this month and we've repeated than we are repeating them coming up in Chevy Chase Maryland and in Tyson's corner next month so good at ... dot com to register today [noise]\n\nAh number you might have\nOne house to sell over decades of time and picking the right\nAge and who knows how to do the job best [noise] you don't want an agent who's got lots of buyers\nTeachers who say I've got buyers [noise] they're not going to represent your interest hoax they're representing the buyers interests\nWell that's it for ... home for this Sunday I'm Eric Stewart along in foster senior solutions straight ahead\nAnd do a show on anything you want all five point nine ... fan and am six thirty to yell\nYou ever feel like your house owns you more than you own it or feel like you have too much stuff and you don't know how to get rid of it all\nMaybe times knocking on your door telling you it's time to make a change and unique I\nThis is Eric Stewart over the past twenty five plus years I've helped thousands transition from large cluttered houses into more comfort\nWhen you it's time to make a change and you need guidance\nMy this is Eric Stewart over the past twenty five plus years I've helped thousands transition from large cluttered houses into more comfortable homes and I've written a free downloadable guide to help it's called the right sizing guy\n[laughter] so\nI think they would all go on vacation while I've read it about how to pay them\nYeah [laughter]\nYou know as I beat in the residential real estate market in ... I'm a I'm a broker I worked under a larger broker and then I have a team of real estate agents in Maryland D.C and Virginia and then we have a staff that supports them and the staff\nIs encouraged through financial gain to be effective and efficient in their work\nWhile also making a base salary the ages themselves like me won't make anything unless they have homes sold\nAnd and that's just a clear example now if I were to go through a time of trouble where there was maybe a medical illness that took me out of selling homes I Would have to rely either on the goodness of my family the kindness of parents or brother or sister church or synagogue like you said\nOr I Would need somebody else has a safety net to save me to help me\nBut ultimately for me to be helped while I'm getting back into a position where I can continue to work and sell more houses [laughter]\nSo the goal is never to just provide help it's always to enable\nSo that you can get back to doing what you should do 'em as you said in your book the story of those who are\nMay be overwhelmed by uh the the addiction to alcohol ah opioids or the other medications that\nThat are very difficult for them to break that ultimately lead them to um poverty that there is now there is a ... there there is a um almost a conviction I think culturally that we have to do whatever it will take to help them\nBreak that addiction how how do you see that happening\nWhile I mean we want to offer help for them to break that addiction\nUh the thing is you you can't you can't wanted more than the ... for themself right um you know I think I think the crucial question a lot of questions from the Bible or even a crucial question is the one that Jesus asked commanders paralyzed for Thirty years\nDo you want to get well and you might think well the answer is obvious sure I Want to get well but um you know I've interviewed over the years lots of people who are who are drug addicts or alcoholics\nReally they don't want to get well I mean they're not happy in their current situation usually ... uh they're basically no it's good it's killing them nevertheless ah they don't want to take any steps to get well they're pretty you know there used to there used to their misery and\nUh we tend to wander keep doing the same old thing we're doing and uh yeah it doesn't it doesn't work help doesn't work unless the person who's being helped really wants to change\nIt's interesting the the story their demands and coming down to that water for thirty eight years if I'm not mistaken and ... and his response to Jesus is to say hey I've been coming down here for thirty eight years every time I Want to get in the water somebody else gets in there for ... takes that blessing and it has a blame shift\nJust it really is on the answering the question he's like he's he's saying I I Want to but somebody else there's always going to get there first and and I think that blame shifting takes away you can look backwards it where you failed\nAnd I think it's common for everybody including me\nWhen I fail and there's some consistency in different areas of my life where I've seen like I'd trip up myself and I think that's true again for all of us\nThat we can look backwards and if we look at the failure and we look at their reasons for it we can ultimately blame other people we can blame situations we can blame things that we didn't control that happen to us\nThe question really is do you want to change and will you do what's necessary I like what James says about the man that looks at his face in the mirror\nYou know ... or a man who does or you're a man who who doesn't do if you look at your face in the mirror and then you forget what you look like that's that's the comparison that James draws for somebody who here's what he should do but then it doesn't actually do it right so\nWe're all called to make change in our lives I think the tragedy of American compassion is that we've enabled people to continue not doing what they should do and continue rewarding them for that\nWhen we shouldn't take a break and come right back with more my interview with Dr Marvin last fall throughout the tragedy
