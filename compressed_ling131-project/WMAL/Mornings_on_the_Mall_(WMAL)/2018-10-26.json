though they were on camera saying something out when I Know better Mary I just do what I understand that that doesn't have to understand the game this is the problem we don't play the game okay All right five twenty nine O W A L\nRemember she let Fox Fox it offered her what like five years one hundred million or something they offered her an outrageous sum of money\nTo stick around and to keep doing her thing she opted out of it at least according to the reports she opted out of it went to NBC where again they offered are also an obscene contract she took it there and now she's taking them for all the worst because she got a nice contractor and so sixty nine million dollars and they're going to they're going to see her out the door I thought the most amazing thing from the story\nIs so she gets in trouble for riffing on you know how a cultural sensibilities have changed over time right where she's talking about black face and and white face and anything else related to Halloween costumes\nShe issues this lengthy apology yesterday on the air she uses a lengthy apology to the staff the today show attacks her all of the hosts come on the air and attack her for what she said and\nNBC clearly you know he felt the Daily Beast reporting on this NBC and their ... their executives were mad at her for the way she went after NBC\nFor for its treatment of women during the Matt Lauer stuff so this is as soon as they did the Daily Beast where basically reporting this was revenge that they were going after Megan Kelly in this way and they saw this is their foot hold the take her out and that's why you don't see if I can tell you on TV Now\nRight was the first of all she left box she was making twenty million a year apparently at Fox striking twenty million dollars you're still had to go find another job girlfriend on\nEither money to learn how to do it back and kick her feet up I don't want to hit it is because she wanted to be Oprah\nThat's why she was never going to be over that ... percent had this thought in her mind is that she was going to leave and become the next Barbara Walters the next Oprah Winfrey and that's why she went number she gets this ... this evening show on on on weekends they can write that already been cancelled it wasn't good and then they have her in the morning\nTo her best tells her where I mean you can answer those you know where to\nGo to he was very good at news that's what she was very good at she's a wonderful doing a job now apparently the other thing from this according to the daily mail nobody likes her to NBC she's not well liked at all\nWhich which I find hard to believe because when I got to work with her she was nothing but nice she was really really nice right and you work with her Fox yeah and she was super nice and so I find it hard to believe that nobody likes her now I did what worked at Fox I don't know if you know\nShe went to NBC right right so she had the taint of Fox\nOh on her when she went to say that's why they didn't like her MLK yes maybe that's what it was well according to an NBC executive with knowledge of the situation\nMegan Kelly is done she is not ever coming back\nAnd ah they're just working out the timing of the announcement but mark my words she has gone will never be than an NBC again and he said here's the worst part her deal as a non break deals so she walks away with all that money all that money it's disgusting and head should role here because of that\nA page six is reporting that she is asking that Ronan Farrow lawyer be present for the meeting they said that move relates probably to the former NBC correspondent Ronan Farrow claims that the network killed his Harvey winds dean ...\nKelly had previously called on NBC to investigate what the story was shelled so it looks like she's trying to set up something for cars so she's going to sue them on top of it 'cause you know six million\nIs not a not for good for her and so far as the principle of it is right and if they're really exacting revenge on her for saying hey Harvard up for Harvey Weinstein because if you're disgusting friendship for him that with him then she has every right to call them out for that and they have no right to fire her over the\nAnd that's a really good point because the whole conversation that she had about white people wearing black they some black people wearing white face of Halloween costumes and she was a kid\nWhen she was a kid that was acceptable she didn't say that it was she just said as a matter of fact when I was a child this wasn't a big deal that's what she said she was ... she again she's being dragged through the mud because of this and she should've chef to apologize to all of our African American co workers\nShe didn't say anything other than a statement of fact that when I was a child this is what you did if you were putting on a costume of somewhat of a different I just I mean even if\nEven if you come across and you say you know what I didn't go to Megan Kelly said or that was clumsy and she shouldn't have said are set up that way does the punishment fit the crime here\nNo one sixty nine million ...

All right we're we're having\nA good time this morning a lot of coffee already so that means there's gonna be an energetic segment here as we come in and we talk about cricket foreign lawyer Michael ... love creepy ... really bad day yesterday\nWhile everyone else was focused on on on package bombs and things and I'm sure Michael I have an ... he was jealous that he was not the recipient of one because it would make him a headline he made headlines in his own way\nBecause remember the allegation that he made against Brett Kavanaugh involving that third accuser Jolie sweating ... the most agree just and pat late false allegations ridiculous against Brett Kavanaugh\nInvolving that third accuser Jolie sweat neck of the most egregious and patently false allegations we've taken against Brett Kavanaugh involving a gang rape and that he was a high school drug\nIt that he was leading a quail outta induced gang rape ... he was a one man crime wave Brett Kavanaugh according to Julie sweating like so [noise]\nThey make all these allegations and they make them in sworn statements to the Senate Judiciary committee as an attempt to hurt Brett Kavanaugh so this is not just like hey who use the media to make allegations into joined us for all of allegations he actually made sworn statements under penalty of perjury\nBecause they figured that uh uh businesses are leaving it happens right here in Montgomery County\nUh we have a minimum wage and posed by our county council and a as a result of that but we see businesses are fleeing the county at a record rate I just found out last night that two of our favorite restaurants up in Germantown now closed so\nThey can't sustain themselves in in this environment our base is lowering the we have a lower income people that are moving into the county upper income people are leaving the county\nAs a result of these oppressive of rules that are implied but things like minimum wage Fifteen dollars an hour just not sustainable for small businesses\nWhy do you think it is that the Democrats don't connect the dots we've seen it as you said in other places it's already been done any experiments thin dime and it ... and you see it happening in Montgomery County why would I mean it's gotta be maddening to say that there there's no connection\nThere is there should be a connection the problem is is that ideology overrides a good sense and uh it's it's a case of that is simply a more of them\nWho subscribe to that ideology uh then there are people who have good common sense and say this is the way you can promote businesses are here in Montgomery County also in the state of Maryland the governor has done a great job and trying to promote business here in the state of Maryland\nIt's a it's an uphill battle all the time because he's got a legislature down there in Annapolis as simply doesn't provide the kind of support that he needs we see a lot of bipartisan reporting coming out of Annapolis and we're all in favor of that the problem is that what we don't hear about is the initiatives that our governor has\nAnd will have one he's reelected\nThat simply get pushback from his legislature or when they come to the for things like gerrymandering for example you mentioned in the earlier segment that a top priority this year to try and get the state redistricted yes we're all in favor of that\nOr we support the governor on that and if we can get to Annapolis on a on November ... will be one of his strongest supporters of in the house of delegates of the problem is ah if I was a Democrat I probably wouldn't be in favor of it because I on the field right now why would I give it up\nUh when they thought the Supreme Court was going to slam dunked them back earlier or just before the primaries everybody was in favor of working with the governor\nNow I think maybe not so much so his independent commission is needed to uh we need to support that and we need to support his reelection to make sure that ah that that we do that were part of what we call here Montgomery team Hogan\nAs myself or this morning I'm joined by a party Jacobs who's sitting just behind me here along with

a sudden they come up with the state of the union or you know during the state union Trump I asked the people to stand up for the first responders or for\nTheir military and they did nothing\nAll the Democrats just sit there and then he asked them to stand up for their country and they didn't do that\nAnd then they asked them to stand up for God because God was one of the reason is from United

me and they certainly don't want to stand up for your military or for your for foreigners\nSo he he captured that far left face the people who love that now you've got a really popular Republican governor\nAnd so if he had been smart he would've been flipped more towards the middle and he would have run as a more moderate Democrat in order to give the governor some kind of challenge knowing full well that he's been nominally popular with over sixty percent of Maryland there's like a a governor Hogan\nBut he he wasn't that smart to do that and because of that he's still running to the far

about the the U.S House specifically if you get there uh what's on the agenda and and what should Republicans we focused on\nI think the first thing we need to focus on is a real attack on the opioid addiction problem um I think that the bill that was signed by the president was it yesterday or the day this week was absolutely a splendid stars\nI really want to focus on solving today's problem not decades from now as my opponent is focused on he's looking at doubling the research budget to find new pain\nMedication that isn't addictive and that has nothing to do with solving today's problem\nI

joining us right now Larry good morning but I don't\nWant to go tell you all doing All right let's see if we can\nSay hey Larry our game there's got to be on the up against state a giants team\nThat doesn't look like it's going to be a much of a threat but in some sense that means the Redskins probably have a very important game in front of them you can't lose to a one insects giants\n[noise] well I don't think you could really pay attention to the record it and this one I think you look at the giants history with a Redskins\nAnd the giants you don't have the edge of the all time series and\nI can recall several games with a metal is it didn't go to the Redskins way so I think that it's a it's a stretch to think that these guys wouldn't be looking at this game as the most important getting with the seas regardless of the record and you look at their talent they've got a lot of talent so you could say there they they should be better than one in six but they're wanted six\nThings haven't gone there way are you like that on Sunday and get your fifth when it's another NFC East in which raises the stakes a little bit it's going to be excited\nOr any surprises that we can maybe see in this coming from the giants or do we did did the right thing\nBut it's got to be exciting\nAny surprises that we can maybe see in this coming from the giants or do we did did the Redskins pretty much know exactly what they're up against [noise]\nWell you you do know you got a youngster in St Paul I'm Barkley who's just looks like a superstar in the making these are great running back he was their first round pick went very high in the draft and he has a disappointed so far as a pro\nAnd of course they've got to go back and junior is always excitable up other issue has been a you know protecting Eli Manning this year in in whether he lie has much less in the tank or not I mean it's not being helped by the office of wind that hasn't been able to protect them so I think the blame for the Redskins just do what they do this kind of like the mantra around here\nEspecially from the defense do what they do do it the Redskins did defensively stop the run I get some pressure up the middle or get some turnovers the Redskins are plus six turnovers that's outstanding that's a [noise] a winning formula in the NFL\nAnd if they can stick with that formula so maybe we'll come home happy on Sunday night I mean it's a big game obviously to try to keep the momentum going and a third winter in a row which were put the Redskins and real good shape seven games and [noise]\nI mean

Maryland\nAnd it's the perception of Maryland ... the ... Maryland is perceived as is solid blue state it is simply not and it is a lot of good people booed Maryland is good Americans who want the best for their for their families and for their futures and that's what governor Hogan\nIs has been doing for the last four years which is why he's going to get reelected overwhelmingly just devastate a Ben Jealous on election day because he is\nRunning a competent government that is not\nTaking a Maryland a away from some of its roots but it's also he he understands the future you understand the economy comes as a businessman he comes\nTo the budget to the state budget it was very sound fiscal ideas of what is good and what is bad our education system are the police departments across the state\nYou look at the the leadership that he did and we will just get to\nThis happened as soon as he became governor but he was he was crystallized by the moment in Baltimore where you had the unrest of the Freddie gray incident and nobody wanted that to happen but leadership is born from\nA situation you find yourself and this governor absolutely performed edit unbelievable levels for the people in Maryland and I think Republican Democrat independent you recognize that from the moment he got into office\nAnd you can correct me if I'm wrong and that this election seems to have a different feel to it and a nationwide because obviously there's a false\nTranslating down to local races which energizing Republican said get out get\nThat first of all I I Do anecdotally see that happen we don't have enough\nWe don't have any data to prove that yet we'll find out on election day an hour after action report but Montgomery County is over one\nHas been a one party have\n... a county for you know decades now\nUnfortunately for the residents because Montgomery County used to have one of the greatest school systems in the country and now you know I have four kids that are in schools in Montgomery County and I can't send them to the public schools all of them anymore because it's they're just not as good as it used to be so\nThe Montgomery County has back is really taking a step back\nAh in in our education system and it has to get back\nAnd that's why you know I see Robin Ficre here but they did this is this is an important important raised the Maryland ... can now understand with with Governor Hogan at the top of the tickets they can actually vote for Republican instead of going down the ballot and voting for Democrat after Democrats\nThey can have choices yeah and I think that that's going to play a dip it in for Maryland Republicans down the road\nOr we'll we'll watch the governor and walking around the building right now\nWe're going to talk to him in him in here but I Want to I Want to ask you did on what you do a lot of political announces put your analysts hat on\nFor a second and talk to me about Maryland Democratic Party there and it outright civil war about Ben Jealous\nI get really bad for them to be honest\nIt's terrible I feel terrible for them bend jealous has truly been abandoned or it is a it is very interesting to see that what they ... you know they're a progressive\nGod if you will in every state you seem to have one right ... but in in Maryland it was Ben Jealous and he ran hard to the left in the primary from\nThinking that that was going to coalesce him that he would build this this model for the general election that would be very progressive and ... and highly energized we've seen the opposite happened for him he has not been able to get to look\nThe DNC chairman has failed Ben Jealous because the DNC chairman is a Maryland or right and he has his eye his future his future I have no doubt he looks at Maryland and he sees himself\nRunning here at some point and I can only hope because he's the exact same type of candidate has been chosen I think ... should be very disappointed by the support he's got nationally from the Democratic Governors Association from the DNC\nAnd and look he's run a very bad campaign but it's really because governor Hogan\nHas run such a good campaign has an incredibly disciplined candidate and if you look at what he's had to go through a you know in his four years as governor it is really I think ... he's transcended the party barrier\nYou don't sound that sympathetic to to avenge Elena strain I gotta admit yeah shocking\nYeah well thank you very much because I Believe we have to break it I think we do have and the governor the governor coming out the best guess thank you so much for joining us ... you have

deep blue state yeah I'm I'm only the second Republican governor and fifty years and the state of Maryland and if I'm to be reelected in ten days I'd I'd only the second Republican governor reelected in the entire two hundred and forty two year history of our states so to say it's a heavily democratic status and understand\nI'm a President Trump lost the state of Maryland by nearly thirty points but we've been able to reach across the aisle and get people read regardless of whether they're Democrats or independents Republicans to say hey we need to put in Maryland on a new path and they liked the way we've we've\nTried to work down the middle tried to reach across the aisle to come up with common sense bipartisan solutions and uh it's what people are are are looking for I think which is why the\nJob approval numbers are so high and we're in the position we're in um people are fed up with the divisiveness southern wanted them both ... both parties are guilty of it but the people that would take the either party to the extremes as opposed to trying to find compromise and trying to figure out solutions is what is sorely lacking\nAlong those lines with both what you said when the when you say that do you think that it Ben Jealous had run more towards the center and not so far to the left and moved towards the center has raised against you do you think he would be\nDoing that I tried to objectively analyze this I think he can give him a\n... credit I mean he says what he believes in the uh he's way out there I mean he he's he's very far left guy and he's not afraid to tell you that um that has I think energize the far left base of the state which was about Fifteen Percent of the people in their own\nUh but uh you know Seventy seven percent approve of the job that I'm doing and it's because most people in Maryland are not far left or far right most of them are are somewhat in the middle there moderates or they're just right of center left of center but they're not extremists\nLives just tickled to death when you were you had your debate with a Mr jealous and you said you know if you just go to my website Ben Jealous that comment you just like there's like I'm not going to venture out [laughter] and I'm not doing it that was the most that repeated line from the debate by the way everybody fed I Love it when you said I'm not offended by it\nI thought it was always keep that pledge I kept the pledge I've seen just about anybody or see things that go to Larry Hogan dot com you won't be any reference of and there\nAre going to go back on something that point that Vince made about how you are able to you and you said I reach across party lines when you have Democrats who don't want to work richest obstruction\nHow can Republicans in other states that were ... maybe people running for governor Republicans running for governor ... just like Maryland what can they learn from you about the making it successful a marriage I think\nPart of it is about tone and uh you know you can disagree without being disagreeable and you have you stopped shouting and pointing fingers and calling each other names and you sit down and listen\nYou can actually find some common ground sometimes you're still stand up for your principles and the things you believe in uh but you try to you know hear what the other side is talking about and see if there isn't some common ground and you can find and we have to in Maryland you know as you started out the conversation where it's more a week or two to one or more than two to one Democrat or Republican\nI'm twenty six percent of the state is Republicans that I'm a Republican governor\nA two thirds more than two thirds of both our houses are very liberal Democrat so they can override every single beat them\nAnd in spite of all that we've really turned a state of Maryland around\nBy working together and uh it it's it's we're not the only ones doing it if you look at Charlie Baker who's a Republican governor of Massachusetts He's in a similar position and the two of us are the two have the two highest approval ratings in the country I think sometimes the Republican governor and Republican state\nUh really can only only pushes the issues that they care about and the Democratic governor and a democratic state only pushes their\nAgenda if you're in a bipartisan state\nYou got to find a way to govern uh that reaches across in and talk to people and brings people together\nYeah so you know one of the things I noticed is about Maryland is definitely have Democrats have been a bit divided on their candidate also on the you've got a bunch of Democrats supporting you I Want to explore that in just a moment we have much more but governor Larry Hogan right\nHere at all to work for a three WMA
