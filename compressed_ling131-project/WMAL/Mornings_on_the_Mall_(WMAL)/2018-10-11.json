yesterday I did not know that nowhere in the constitution does it say that Supreme Court justices are appointed for life which is kind of learned that somewhere along the way we just take that as gospel that Supreme Court justices are appointed for life\nWell articles three sexual one which which of the constitution which dishes which addresses the judicial branch\nSays this regarding the Supreme Court the judicial power of the United states Shelby vested in one Supreme Court\nAnd in such an end in such inferior court says that Congress may from time to time ordain and establish which we have a whole bunch of inferior courts inferior and more when some what [noise] the jets and\nNinth I'm looking at you the judges both of the Supreme end inferior courts shell hold their offices during good behavior and shall I stayed at times received for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office\nAnd shall I stayed at times received for their services a compensation which shall not be diminished during their continuance in office\nDoesn't say anything about a lifetime appointment it says they show hold their offices during good behavior\nSo I don't mind somebody being in a an office in Congress or in the house for two terms that they go look to uh\nTo the Senate and they\nSpend a roommate but I'm the only time I I I Would be in favor of staying longer during a leadership position like a a bigger house or a house majority or ... or something like that where you have to have somebody there in that position leading the rest of the caucus\nYeah here's here's one of the Andrew thank you could call and I ... and it's obviously thought a lot about it to the point that he's like ... the number of years that he might see a term limits on one of the things about the Supreme Court especially these last two packs by President Trump and I could see it in the reverse too where I'd be like man\nI Can't believe this young guy is going to serve all life term this liberal justice who I Am not enthusiastic about that's going to drive me crazy but on but that's not what happened here you had President Trump pick two justices to an nominally as far as we can tell constitutional justices\nWho are going to be loyal to the constitution I'll tell you what that gave me so much confidence that the world is going to look at least something like\nWhat I recognized by the time my daughter is able to vote so whatever Trump's lasting legacy is\nWhatever the things that he does is president\nThe two things that he's promised for the future right now\nAre Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd if there was some sort of like term limits imposed on them I Would have less confidence in the future\nI Want them to serve for a long time right so long as they are constitutional justice\nAnd and the left feels the same way about R D G and and and that's one of the reasons they were there are so upset about Brett Kavanaugh it all depends on where where which side of the aisle you're on as to how you view this\nBut if it were this it would be the same is there any kind of term limit it be the same for for ... whichever whoever happens to be our lives of who appointed them while they say they name for everybody\nSays that since about the Nineteen seventies it was the length of services really extended yes because prior to that most justice is served like less than Fifteen Years [noise] which is like really only Fifteen\nAnd the thing about this there are some justices who may be you know sixty who are going to get appointed judges who would be really great and the Supreme Court but they're not going to be be be appointed\nBecause they can they're only going to serve you know maybe ten years Seventy Seventy five maybe Fifteen Years and the president appointing them says well I Want them to serve for a long time because I Want them to from my point of view so they just keep getting younger and younger yeah as they get appointed\nI don't know if that's necessarily a good thing either\nBut is it their constitutional us they are if they're your guy yeah yeah I mean right but but you can't you know you're doing with the left does that you don't like\nI realize that and that's why I said like if there was a Democratic president appointing a bunch of like hair on fire liberal activists to the court we would drive me crazy right now\nAnd maybe that's the ... maybe that's a compelling reason to get to to get into that side of the debate and be like Alice internal it's but right now we have an ad for a moment the court hasn't had a five for conservative majority in like forever but you'd love it because who's going to term limited out first\nToo liberal judges right yeah that's the irony of All

Court\nWell the yeah so anyway the dumb areas to marriage point Michael this it's just it's the years that you started on the Supreme Court are not mentioned there's no mention of the aisle years in

the interesting things that I've been watching with the president over the past a week or so as he campaigns around the country\nIs first of all it feels like they've got he's got wind at his back in the Republican Party broadly does because of Brett Kavanaugh on the way the Democrats overplay their hand with their accusations against that man is now a Supreme Court justice additionally\nHe's been rolling out a campaign line referring to Democrats as an angry mob are emphasizing the political violence we've seen around the country and the cost of that violence\nAs a as a as an much very much an overplayed political hand and one that should worry the country um do you do is does the White House think this is the fact that it is it working in is it convincing people to shop for Republicans in the midterms\nThe White House to absolutely believe that that is effective and they have long seen the big cultural moment like those in\nWhich Sarah Huckabee Sanders was was run out of a restaurant which Ted Cruz and his wife are barred from a restaurant or what resonate the most of the most deeply across the country and Brett Kavanaugh's nomination\nReally was you know that on steroids and then some and it was it was really a cultural moment and clarifying to the White House because they see it\nAs they will have that faith never ending obstruction said as emotional than most of the same\nMatter what they do and that the president is seen as unfairly maligned and blocked at every turn and that that really is a good position for them because they previously had not been able to touch a vein which Republican voters an independent voters curve out unless it's something that seems to be working for them right\nNow you know it's illegal to incite violence rate it's illegal to

people are pretty good about saying\nThings just vaguely now so that ... miles and I think what's interesting is that Hillary and Eric Holder and many of these others were some of President Trump's biggest critics throughout the campaign for civility for harsh rhetoric and and now they're\nWanting like quite explicitly saying that you cannot be that Democrats cannot be\nCivil through Republican says that are really very dark\nYou know political outlook that that has bad and dangerous repercussion as\nWell as saga interestingly Eric Holder when he made that statement this week that's when they go low we kick them what he was doing was modifying a statement by Michelle Obama which is when they go low we go high\nAnd the people we are hearing from at this moment Arbor rock and Michelle Obama they're not even they're not stepping out to say Eric Holder's wrong they're not stepping out to say Hillary Clinton is wrong they're just sitting in silence argues struck by that too\nYeah

Obamas were all about for eight years\nHave you seen any movement on the president's call for stricter penalties for libel in response to the cabinet hearing\nYou know I have and I I get that is something that it's a it's a bit of a pet project that he that he has and and that he likes to talk about but the truth of the live long after our show strong willed journalists I think
