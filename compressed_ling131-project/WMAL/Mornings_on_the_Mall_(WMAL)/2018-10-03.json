right now\nAs president yesterday and\nAmber I I you're you're younger you see this you're closer to college than I Am in and so you saw the same things are happening when you were in college right yeah definitely I mean it seems like\nA lot of young women are told that things are sexual assault when they're not in college I'm so for example if you regret a drunk and hook up then that's sexual assault not saying that that has anything to do with the specific Kavanaugh case\nBut there seems to be a broadening of the definition of white and assault as in kind of blurring those lines so it makes it more difficult\nFor people to truly suss out the facts of the situations and of course when alcohol is involved it's even harder I've slowly and and I noticed that none of the Democratic senators asked her about her drinking habits because you've been blacked out because you may be not remember 'cause you're blacked out you know\nI look good to Alan Marilyn quickly here alga morning

that's to your point thank you all this year pointing out that the line keeps moving\nAnd and that's what they're doing they keep moving the goalposts need due to Kavanaugh to in order to the end justifies the means as long as we get to that narrative away as long as you get the outcome we want that we just move it we just change with the rules of the game are that's really scary exactly that's why they're lumping in things like throwing ice with the serious allegation of sexual assaults to throw it\nAnd then we just we just change with the rules of the game are that's really scary exactly that's why they're lumping in things like throwing ice with the serious allegation of sexual assaults throwing I [noise] I I admitted yesterday on there that are thrown ice five twenty nine and W. avail\nAlso included in this bio was the fact that he got arrested at one point for underage drinking while a Stanford wow lock him up a west did\nAll rested not a friend of his was arrested well right well and not even arrested because when when Brett Kavanaugh allegedly through ice that someone in a bar it was his friend who was questioned by the police right right\nThat's exactly right they well I think I'm not sure if Kavanaugh was questioned too but he was listed in the police report as allegedly having thrown ice whereas his friend apparently through a pint class at the guy's head\nAnd cut him right\nBack in the day the standard was so low they didn't arrest him for that yeah you're on TALK of college bar shenanigans exactly ... against [noise]\nUm so yeah a one point he was arrested for under age drinking can you imagine today the shock of the Democrats they never would have confirmed him right they shouldn't have confirmed him she was arrested for underage drinking that's awful well yeah based on their standards you would think but\nThen you look at a Ted Cruz's challenger beta or work in Texas\nHe hasn't even worse a drunken behavior on his record he was involved in a DWI where he was accused of fleeing the scene he had a female passenger and his car\nUm if you're getting flashbacks to Ted Kennedy so am I. [laughter] ah but apparently you're not allowed to talk about that when you talk about ... or so again we see this double standard uh where this uh this apparently drinking is bad only if you're a Republican\nWell either that or the a progressive\nAre becoming conservative to becoming teetotaler so interesting so there's that there's also um oh in in the piece Gladwell devoted a total of one

a something that would energize the Republican base the conservative base\nAnd they would that they would have to stay home that's a perk but he said it would be angry but then he changed his point of view on that show the very next day and thought that it would be enormous turnout I still think he's about to get for the most highly qualified or is that now seven FBI there were a background investigations that six more than I have had\nAnd uh it's a fear that it it's all about the court it has nothing to do with these other things\nThat the Democrats would be ah complaining about

Kavanaugh to his friends organizing a trip to the each week and in the letter he says we have to warn the neighbors that we're going to be a noxious drunk high school kids I guess the idea here is that this is contradicting his claims of not being a heavy drinker what do you make of that\nIs to testify a lot how much she liked beer and drink beer too much I didn't see anything contradicting

but it's a petty it's absurd and\nIt shows you it's not necessarily moving the goalpost it's goalpost it's desperation up by the left who's trying to destroy the Kavanaugh nomination and um you know

where the elevators are uh the members don't only stick to member I only a elevator now and they hang out in the elevator banks a few of them are going into the elevators and refusing to get off a day

also was at that same as the same event for the Atlantic festival yesterday that Hillary Clinton was at and this is what I wasn't invited\nMe to ... so but you're here today in Syria better invite her out here's Here's Senator flake it saying almost kind of Hillary said\nI told my wife I Hope that I Would sound that ... if I were if I felt that I was unjustly\nBut then it went on and the

are calling out and now and she also has not released that letter to even the Republican she will not let the Republicans\nSee the letter so Dianne Feinstein has got a lot of um questions swirling around her\nCould that be why she doesn't want the the ... the result of the FBI investigation made public\nAnd that's what I'm Wondering because Dianne Feinstein had the opportunity to\nReport this

hearings are so there's certainly a lot of people questioning her part and his fellow Democrats have even gone on the record and interviews on CNN and MSNBC saying that they aren't happy with the way that this has been handled\nSo when you look at her reelection campaign you have to wonder if her fellow progressives are going to stump for her where she's going to be hanging out there on her own\nI

has been very consistent as he said\nThat while he feels for Dr Ford he also recognizes that there isn't a lot of evidence to corroborate the case then that's been his position from the very beginning
