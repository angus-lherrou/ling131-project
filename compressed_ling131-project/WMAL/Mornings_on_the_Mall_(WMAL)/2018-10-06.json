online training academy is not a broker dealer certified financial planner or register investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nSome of the loser self investors\nGuilty to finance a market for sponsored online for the economy goes to show ... online training academy\nHas been helping individuals like you become do it yourself investors since Nineteen Ninety seven\nOnline training Academy of two campuses to serve our listening audience one at Tyson's corner and one near BWI Airport\nAnd the past few weeks we've been talking about some of the strategies you can do to emulate what the financial services folks charge you for\nAnd ways to reduce your fees and expenses and basic keep them in your own pocket as opposed to giving them to a stranger so a couple of weeks ago we talked about building your own annuity and the same side and walk us through how we would use our user assets protected from market risk\nMake sure there was no downside but then also use that use that the income to buy options on the s it'd be five hundred so we'd have no stock market risk and have stock market upside and be able to do that for the long haul which is basically what\nThe ... the uh professional annuity folks are doing and what they're doing for the privilege is if they're charging high fees high expenses you know and ... are the highest be\nHigh highest commission product available for financial services so there's a time when a newly makes a lot of sense when you're in the deep human relation phase and so as you enter in retirement or later on in life it might make sense to have an annuity\nAnnuity but it'd make more sense if you were able to manage that annuity yourself and keep the fees and expenses in your pocket as opposed to giving them to someone else and also last week we talked about building a diversified portfolio and really simplifying that down\nNow one of the things that the financial services folks always talk about his importance of a financial plan and you know if you have you know millions of dollars are several hundred thousand dollars a pill for produce a financial plan for you for a thousand or two thousand dollars or more than that\nAnd then they'll charge you a fee to maintain that plan and invariably the financial services plans are passive investing plans so the idea is you're going to pay us money and you're gonna keep paying us money for the privilege of not having to do anything and\nThat's okay and that that may be a valid choices for you and where you're at in life at the same time what we know is if we're actively involved with our assets\nAnd we're actively involved with their income the likelihood of getting a better result is a lot better than if we're relying on some stranger and particularly in this environment this low growth environment where you know we're we're expecting you know two three four percent\nFor the last for the next you know five to ten years and that's what we've achieved over the last Eighteen years now so if you look at the S. and P. five hundred basically going up about you know three percent maybe four percent\nOn an annual basis for the last Eighteen years and so if you analyze that and then take out inflation you basically making a couple of points and if you're happy with that if that's going to give you the income you need when you retire\nIf that's going to give you the income you need to get to a hundred and keep doing that\nBut for most people for Ninety eight percent of people aren't going to be millionaires when they retire you need to find other strategies we can generate better income\nAnd you know that's why we refer to any single digits strategy as an unproductive asset\nBecause in this environment if you're only getting single digit returns eventually you're going to run out of money and this whole accumulation model of retirement isn't really designed to help you make it for thirty or forty years probably last pretend maybe for Fifteen and then depends on how much money have left\nAnd hopefully you'll you'll be able to have your kids to take care of you or something like that if you want to have a real retirement where you're totally in control if you believe in yourself if you believe that being you know spending a few hours to take care of your future is worth it\nThan you owe to yourself to find out of becoming do yourself investors the right fit for you and you know one of the things that we do is we don't develop financial plans but one of the things we do with our students we help you develop what we call a success plan\nAnd that's access planted you deciding what it is you're trying to accomplish not someone else's view of retirement not some fantasy of yeah they're going to live life on the beach you know so this very funny he trade commercial the other day\nAnd they were talking about how you know when they retire they're going to be on the beach and they're going to pointed things and everything's going to be wonderful\nThat's great 'cause that's what every ad looks like but for most people to get those results you need to be actively involved with it\nAnd the beauty of becoming a do it yourself investor today is that you know with a few hours a week a few hours a month you can start reducing or fees and expenses improving your return and reducing your risk and those are that's a formula for financial success right there\nAnd so part of what we get into as students come in to us we help you develop what we call them income and wealth education plan\nAnd the income and wealth education plan is the foundation for later becomes your success plan and the incoming off education plan goes into what is it you're trying to accomplish and why and that focus on what you're trying to accomplish and why is really critical\nRather than paying someone else you know two three four percent a year and allowing your money to have expenses taken out of it and one of the things you can do is hold that in exchange traded fund and do what they call it sixty forty split so sixty percent exposed to the larger stock market\nForty percent exposed to a larger bond market\nAnd you can use an ATF called SP wide attract the larger market you can use a ... a ATF called TLC which tracks the long bond market tracks twenty year bonds and so if you use that sixty forty split and you're satisfied with single digit returns basically you know once a year once a quarter\nYou know you might rebalance that to make sure that you're sixty forty balances there but that's something you can do relatively easily\nAnd you get to keep the two or three percent that you're paying to the mutual fund you get to keep the two or three percent that you're paying your financial adviser and that way you're going to allow yourself to get better preservation returns and this is something that's a real simple strategy and it plays out you can do even rebounds as you add contributions\nBut that's a real simple preservation strategy can use\nIf you get more sophisticated and recognize where you're at you might want to look at some other strategies so most people\nHave all of their assets the nominated in the U.S dollar and the U.S dollar has been the currency it's been a the global currency it's the reserve currency and most countries have it and so it's been able to maintain its significance regardless of normal ...\nRegardless of normal market forces because it is the dominant force but one of the things you have to recognize with the changes that are going on with America's relationship with the world that impacts the value of the dollar and so in two thousand Seventeen the dollar was down ten percent\nSo you may not know it but the value of your assets last ten percent so if you make ten percent you also lost ten percent said basically broke even and most people didn't make ten percent last year so you probably lost some money now this year has been interesting 'cause we've been you\nKnow down five percent up ... percent were basically at break even for the year basically\nAnd one of the things that we've seen this movie before you know the government is pursuing these pro oil policy crow producer policies that from two thousand one to two thousand eight the value of the u._s. dollars basically cut in half\nAgainst the Australian dollar and a number of other currencies and so one of the things you can do it from a preservation strategy\nAnd what that means the dollar gets weaker and continues to get weaker that means you can buy less stuff or your dollars don't do as far that's one of the reasons why two thousand eight felt so bad you had money but that money could buy as much stuff as it used to\nAnd if we're if we're on the verge of doing that again we're kinda partway down this path\nYou know you can use them for X strategies to protect your assets and so you know we've students that whole currency knows FDIC insured um us based bank where you're allowed to hold foreign currency\nUm it had been ever bank and now it's TI a bank and so it ... it gives you some strategies where you can protect it in case of dollar goes down you can hold have exposure to other currencies you can also use the spot for X market\nWhich allows you to control large pieces of the market large pieces of of um currency\nAnd do it in a way where you know you get the benefit if the dollar goes down and so these are strategies that you can use\nThat again it it's outside the norm\nBut if in what what is the attraction to being average or below average I mean really what the financial services people are selling you is the opportunity for below average returns\nAnd if you want to be below average keeping below average that's fine if you want to break free from being below average you need to start thinking about things differently\nAnd start understanding where the opportunities are\nIn the market and how you can you know with a little bit of time a little bit of knowledge you can start doing things safer and smarter than what you're currently doing\nAnd so for preservation strategies we have some students that use it for X market so they'll have buying power purchasing power parity is the fancy term for it but the idea is that if the dollar goes up you're making money anyway the dollar goes down you should have at least the strategy to protect yourself in that event\nAnd so another strategy understood Jews are using options and you know certainly for future income you know we have a program focused on using selling options to generate income and a safer smarter way in a way to get more consistent returns\nWell we can do the same thing in our preservation strategy and we can target a lower return sunset of targeting you know eight ten twelve percent\nWe can use similar strategies amusing cast secured puts using covered calls income asset allocation and use those four to generate you know three four five percent\nAnd by doing that it takes less risk on to get the same or better return than what you're currently doing and from a financial perspective that's good financial management and so if you're interested in learning how to preserve what you've got but do it in a safer smarter way you know for a lot of our students options are great way to do that\nAnd then we have a program called the mastermind community where every day we're identifying safe places to sell your options across a number of each ts and some students do it every week some students do it every month it's depends on how involved you want to be with your money\nBut the idea is if you're involved in a safer smarter way then you have more say in the ... returns are getting\nAnother great preservation strategy is real estate so we have a number of students that you know use the financial markets to generate current income\nThey use the financial markets to generate their future income but then they use real estate as a way of preserving their assets and you know real estate it generally gets about a six percent return over time\nAnd it has will Rogers said you know they're not making any more so there's if if you find yourself looking for the right type of market so part of what you have to do is look for\nMarkets that are projecting growth over the next ten twenty Thirty years and the bureau of Labor Statistics provides these population studies and so if you take a look at North Carolina take a look at the Georgia Florida Texas you know these are areas that are slated to continue to\nIt is to continue to grow Tennessee as opportunities there and then you have to take into account the whole hurricane risk so that probably takes taxes to North Carolina and Florida out but there's opportunities in Georgia Tennessee where you can basically I expose yourself to a growing market so that you're going to have increased demand\nUsing some real estate strategies that are designed to provide you with some tax benefits as well as preserve your money again is safer smarter way\nFor you to build your success plan on things that makes sense for you not for someone else and but we want is for people that really care about their assets really care about their income\nThat want to achieve success yeah those are the people we can help\nSo if you're interested in becoming a do it

throughout the world and they get to meet some really great people you know or like minded people good work ethic people\nAnd just some solid people get to meet them along the way on and then again I remember what it was like to be not knowing what I Know now and and just the way that I Would like to have you know be treated at that point you know with patients and kindness and and uh so I get the chance to do that with people now and actually just be patient with them watch the ... the progress that they're making\nYou know and it's like and it's like you know you say as far as\nThe more you do it the better you understand it so it it does help me as well do you know doing these classes over and over and and the repetition it gives you a deeper understanding of what you're doing on a regular basis and it makes it better trader so it's a it's it's a win win win all around\nSo let's get down to brass tacks and makes you a better trade or how does being an instructor you know produce results for you in your regular trading irregular investing\nYeah and again in a great question I it it really fine tune your rules then it shows you the importance of\nUm of having a trade planned following the trade plan it also keeps you exposed to new ideas and new things that are going out there it's it's funny sometimes a student all ask a question and just in the way that they asked the question\nHelps you get a better understanding of of of what your answer actually is and how it how that application can be used in the classroom and in your own trading so uh it definitely keeps your shower and uh and it always gives you a better understanding of what you're what you're doing as a as a traitor yourself\nAnd donned awesome as one of our local instructors and he's been trading on his own since Nineteen eighty seven and he's been instructor about ten years and he told me that every time he teaches a class he learn something from a student that helps them become a better trader\nWould agree with that yeah there's a number of students and we always talk about you know some of the great success stories and there's a number of them with with on like trade academy you know given the way that we teach our classes and the content and the and the you know the professionalism of the instructors so yeah there's a number of things that\nThe things that that go well there and uh yeah I'd say after listening to a lot of the traders and I've had a number and come back this week which has been very rewarding but yeah they take what you see a woman they incorporate into their trade plans and to hear their success stories um time and time again it's it's very rewarding and again it's one of the benefits of getting to do what I Do\nSo that your students bring you an apple or what are the rewards up in your students you know it's almost like he walked into the room today which I Know you didn't\nDo but there are literally two apples on my desk as you speak so that is very very funny that you actually say that but um you know I tell you what a really cool story on a on a on a on another level of that though as far as gifts says I'm a I'm not a I was never in the military but this gentleman and his name is tennis from Arizona and like I say is a great guy but he's the guy that came into the Baltimore class\nYou know a few months back and I met originally in Phoenix but\nHe pulled me aside in in the Baltimore class a few months ago when we were in uh we were in\nAnd he he he literally I almost broke down and we're talking about a really tough guys like you said in special forces\nUm military fantastic guy but he gave me I'm a metal on\nThat's representative of of the military and uh and taught me a couple of things about how to you know how to use it and some of the language they use but that to me it was and I still have the course and I keep it with me and my in my bag and I travel with and but that was a really cool thing to have 'em and like I said I have it all the time so that was one of the more memorable guessed that I ever see for someone\nThat's great and in this area we have students from all branches of the military we have enlisted way of officers and we find is that you know the folks that can follow a standard operating procedure\nThe folks that care about their results the folks that can be disciplined enough to follow the things that you lay out are the ones that can do well and that's where the military folks often our best students no\nQuestion about it and I we see a lot of them as you say here in Washington DC a lot in Baltimore on actually I did a class in Kansas City a couple of weeks ago and almost the entire class was military or ex military\nAnd you're right the the language which was with which they speak the uh\nThe rules the way they follow him the discipline or it does it make it 'cause that's what trading is all about you got to be able to\nYou don't follow a plan um realize that it's not going to be perfect every time there's going to be losses but how you manage those losses and how you follow your plan is really going to determine whether or not you're successful in this business so yeah I'm a military ex military uh certainly great candidates for for high end successful level traders\nAnd we we had a student from the ... name was ... he was wounded in Afghanistan severe pie TST could only focus for about Fifteen minutes at a time and he went through the course strategy class and they did the trading contest\nAnd sure enough at the end of the day and one wow that's awesome and and the instructor said well and you can only focus for Fifteen minutes how can you do this he said I just follow the rules\nIsn't that great phenomenal yeah love it and it is so true you know when the laser it with the rules are laid out the right way and then followed I think that's the only thing we ought to remember um yeah it's all it's all set up there for you to be successful and that's why people come to us the way they do which is which is great\nAnd part of it is transforming lives central tour mission how many lives have you transform doesn't online

people have you take\nBut things where we can take you out of the market risk give you the opportunity to generate similar return but do it in a way where you are in control and you're not paying someone for the privilege of them losing your money\nAnd what you're doing is you're able to retain the fees and expenses yourself\nBecause you're not generating high fees you're not generating high expenses you get to keep those in your pocket and that improves your overall peace of mind that improves your ability to sleep at night\nAnd haven't preservation strategies that are designed to make

lifetime appointment of judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court\nAnd when Lisa Murkowski voted ne will [laughter]\nWill flick we're going into overtime at a football game\nThat it came to Susan Collins Susan Collins had not indicated which way she would vote\nUntil she spoke she was scheduled for three o'clock but speeches ran along so it was passed three o'clock she spoke for forty five

and and uh you Jeff Flake or you know made some comments he was talking as he was entering his car\nBecause as you will hear later if you're in the halls of the Senate office building\nYou were drowned out if you were trying to make reports to you know comments to reporters so we'll talk about that in a second but Jeff Flake or his thoughts in of course it was Jeff Flake that made that decision last weekend to call for the FBI follow up inquiry\nAnd this is what Jeff Flake had to say yesterday\nAnd you find a vote yes Marco\nSomething big change so\nBut anyway I'm Glad we got a better ... what is now\nAnd ah he also had this following comment\nWe've all been saying I'm\nJust a difficult decision for everybody so I'm\nSo we saw the protesters and and some things stood out to me as I was watching some of the video coming off of\nCapitol Hill and it's not only that you know protesters they'll do the the chance and the you know repeat the courses of a you know shame on you or whatever but it was the preparation of of some of the protesters that I found interesting and it it sort of this repeat after me\nAnd it it it it feels like they're just kind of trying to win grain things into these protesters mind you know I don't want to say brain washing cars going a little too far but listen to this and this is not an eight to ... the repetitive chance\nThat you're going to go out and you're just going to say the same thing over this is the instructions okay listen to how they present the instructions to the protesters\n[noise]\nYou get an idea to like the meet me to the

M. A. O. L. dot com and search legally speaking that's WMA L. dot com search legally speaking\nThe Democratic Senator Joe Manchin announcing friday that he would vote for the confirmation of judge Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court and senator mansion in West Virginia Democrat voting for Republican what strikes you most about his announcement\n... really jumped off the page of the ... you know if you look at the maps of the Senate right now they're fifty one Republicans in the chamber and forty nine at least and that there is a caucus with the Democrats\nIncluding senator Manson when Susan Collins gave her for speech at three PM friday which is what she really accept her hand and said she would vote to confirm she became the fifty fifty a vote so that effectively solidified the confirmation assuming no wind changes their mind\nAnd I can tell you within I Would say between sixty and a hundred and twenty seconds of her finishing her speech every reporter and if they got a press release in our inboxes Joe Manchin announcing his plans to also vote for the confirmation\nAnd you know for months and months and months since I think it was the July nine formal nomination\nPeople wondered what Joe Manchin has got to do any how these public outreach of that\nWas conducted interviews he's been out with the people he met with this pro life groups but then this pro choice her but you've just never really gotten to read on him and then came to sexual assault allegation and express that concern and he said with the FBI investigation but\nNo one really knew what the senator was going to do up until the vote was really solidified and then at that point you know within seconds of\nAny chance of a turnaround on the vote in the rearview mirror that was one for there to match came forward and criticism came extremely quickly I'm from his opponent from the state Republican Party and you know people are on them now not so much for the vote itself but for this practice of\nSeemingly lying in wait I suppose and tell the whole situation kind of works itself out and then just kind of fighting with the winner whatever position that may be\nWell it's not the first time that he split from his party is he voted yes on the confirmation of Neil Gorsuch and Jeff Sessions what strikes me about mentioned is is that he will cross the party lines how is it that he is able to do that\nYou know you got to understand that in West Virginia Democrats outnumber Republicans with terms of voter registration but Donald Trump won by forty two points over Hillary Clinton so it doesn't stack up as neatly as you think it would\nIn a Democrat in West Virginia is not a Democrat elsewhere in the country I mean a lot of it just a more it's a more conservative Democrat and more old school union focus kind of Democrat and\nSarah mentioned I mean you know he's not necessarily the love by the progressive community out here and he has like you mentioned he supported Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court he supported Jeff Sessions I think the only\nFor ... years who he is voted against would be let's say there is Mick Mulvaney a Tom Price for help for her health Secretary Tom price current budget director Mick Mulvaney education secretary Betsy devolved\nAnd commerce secretary Wilbur Ross so he's not necessarily a rubber stamp but he's he's one of the few remaining centrist in the Senate\nIt some people would say maybe he's not a centrist is just trying to say that the skin but that's a mansion in that's that's the political actor he is here\nSo he's in a reelection campaign against the Republican candidate Patrick Morrisey or how would you sum up the status of the race in did it change friday afternoon\nRight well I Can't tell you that most independent polls have had Joe Manchin up somewhere around eight points I Know I've seen an internal democratic poll that was close to twelve and then some internal Republican polls that were closer for or the racist tied\nWhatever the case it looks like Joe Manchin has a comfortable but certainly not a definitive lead as to how friday's vote will affect the race I have to be honest I have no idea and I think that that I think that anyone who says they defended to do now is\nJust not being honest because it's a it's a tricky thing to measure because mentioning may have acted as many Republicans would want him to act but I don't know that he was ever really going to please them\nAnd then on the flip side there are a lot of progressive Democrats who are probably pretty deflated having seen this happen I Know I just talk to Joe mansions primary opponent who was a fairly progressive Democrat and she was saying you know this is this is bad and Joe Manchin left the party down but\nYou know Patrick Morrisey is a is a big time conservative he's a very very pro life oh he's a\nVery I mean he calls himself a conservative fire fighter and as always touting his pro life credentials\nSo you know it could really cut both ways and at the end of the day Joe Manchin made a calculation right or wrong and I don't think anyone has this definitive idea of how this will affect election thirty days from friday\nYou mentioned the loss of progressive support and we heard reports friday afternoon but some of the liberal packs would now cut their funding to support mansions reelection do you see other downsides for him\nTo me the biggest downside I see I think you'll be okay in in a financial department but I think his big problem is just going to be getting people out to the polls I don't imagine a lot of progressive deciding to vote for her\nTo go out and vote for Patrick Morrisey now but maybe they just don't want to cast a vote for mansion you know maybe they'd go from likely voters to more apathetic and unreliable maybe they don't go knock on doors for him you know maybe they don't do\nThese little things that kind of have these these ripple effect single action\nOr on the flip side maybe people have an empathy and they know that Joe mansion voting against the guy like judge Kavanaugh especially when the vote was already decided by the time he passed it you know maybe they can just empathize with a guy and say look\nThe writings on the wall he did what he had to do he's when he's the lesser of two evils or this is what a West Virginia Democrat looks like it and this is how he acts I think uh fortunately we won't really have an answer to that question until November sex\nYou just mentioned what a West Virginia Democrats looks like a I think we were surprised to see a West Virginia democratic governor Jim Justice elected as a Democrat then change party affiliation\nParticipating in the Donald Trump rally to support Patrick Morrisey his relationship the Donald Trump they were singing each other's prays at that rally [noise]\nWell Jim Justice was elected as a democratic governor and that was November twenty six game and that was in a a big election year for Republicans I mean they they solidified leads in the state house\nThere are two statewide Democrats that remain there's Joe mansion and then there's the state treasurer here but Jim Justice went out you know in that year with Donald Trump on the ballot and that was a big deal until August of two thousand Seventeen when [laughter] Jim Justice switched parties and the Donald Trump rally in officially joined the Republican Party\nAnd what's really interesting about them is in a in a pretty crowded primary there were three pretty solid candidates in the Democratic gubernatorial primary Joe Manchin back Jim Justice\nAnd he had his people you know he has he's had some of the same staffers working for um for very long time\nThey went out and they work for Jim Justice and they supported him\nA ... you know after Jim Justice became a Republican a lot of his staff either left or were fired now they work for a mansion but so you saw Joe mansion lend a lot of support you know he's a very old time machine style politician here\nAnd he put that machine behind Jim Justice then Jim Justice goes and switch parties and is now campaigning for Patrick Morrisey and you know I did get a chance to ask senator Manchin about at one time and he actually said that\nSupporting and Jim Justice was really want to first he said mistake and he later clarified that statement to be disappointment civil here but\nThe only Joe mansion kind of very long career he's been in office since maybe the eighties and\nAnd he's had a checkered history with the party of his own in Nineteen Ninety six the last time he was being in an election he actually went out and formed Democrats for Underwood which was a group to support the Republican candidate for governor Cecil Underwood who is running against Charlotte ... so\nHe went and supported a guy who now has turned his back on them it's an ugly it's kind of this I was sitting in the room every time Jim Justice gets up there and says you guys have to go vote for Patrick Morrisey\nSo final question Jay when it comes down to the election for Senate West Virginia what would you say are the defining differences between the two candidates\nWell I'd say one of the biggest differences right now and I think you'll see mansion really try to take some attention off this Brett Kavanaugh stuff and onto this would be health care\nAnd Joe Manchin was a critical vote with the Democrats lined due to protect and preserve the Affordable CARE Act he voted against the tax reform package which cut the individual mandate that bill\nAnd what's interesting about how those worlds collide is the attorney general Texas right now has led a lawsuit and currently in federal court\nAnd it challenges the constitutionality of the Affordable CARE Act under the logic that because there is no more individual mandate\nEssentially to the law's not constitutionally sound to to save a long and complicated like legal point and Patrick Morrisey of the attorney general West Virginia has signed on\nNo obligation in minutes you'll have a choice of your best raised from up to ten highly rated life insurance companies\nRichard

nominee while mansion or red state Democrat running for reelection released a statement almost immediately thereafter saying he will do the same\nThe Collins and mentioned boats are critical for

N. A. L. more Washington comes to talk of Saturday\nMorning update continues a week of turmoil on Capitol Hill looking at it from a number of different perspectives we're joined by Cheryl ... who's the host of full measure every Sunday Morning ABC seven at ten o'clock Cheryl nice to have you with us thanks for having me\nAnd you spoke with Senator Lindsey Graham late in the week and it has been quite a week and Lindsey Graham has been\nA really the face of the Republican Party and the speech that he made during the Senate Judiciary committee meeting a was a speech that was heard around the world what did he tell you when you spoke with him\nAnd me and\nAll that you know a lot of the big picture questions and one thing tell talk with us about one of the things he said was\nWhen I asked her we set a new president which is that something I wandered that anybody who comes up with an accusation at any point in any process against on any official\nGet a congressional hearing and stop the work whether there's any cooperation or evidence or not I think to me I'm not saying right or wrong but we had a president and I thought that that was interesting because he said he may well be the next chairman of the Judiciary Committee\nAnd he said we're going to have new rule so and short he thing he would not have lead or will not let that happen again the same way came down at the eleventh hour here\nSo we'll see that conversation with Lindsey Graham tomorrow morning I'm interesting story you have and it's a I think ... story we don't even think about and that is he waste in for somebody not familiar with the term e waste what is it and why is it so important to us\nWell I never I never heard of it either\nWell I've never I never heard of it either but it's electronic waste like all margin from all of our computers\nCell phones and every electronic device this stuff has been pouring into landfills our water supply\nI guess it's responsible for a lot of the mercury that toxic in our fish we ship it overseas to China where you know little children are paid to go through to salvage a little piece of metal and it goes into their water it's toxic and brain damaging so it's\nA huge problem and I found a guy we did a story with the major e waste recycler it says mission in life that try to you know save the environment but where do you hear what happened to him after this mission of his trying to recycle you know all of these electronics\nWill he ended up running into one of the tech giants did me\nHe did because it turns out unbeknownst to him a Microsoft saw the work he was doing as taking away from sales have new computers from them so he became a target he actually had a home raided by armed federal agents thought it was a mistake when it happened\nTo come to find out um according to the prosecutor Microsoft wanted his head on a platter and\nThey plan to deliver it to them\nFound him guilty of what I Would kind of call a technicality sort of a copyright issue and he thought hey it's probably a fine or a slap on the wrist never been handled it like this criminally before well guess what he's in federal prison now this recycler after he was targeted for this work wow\nYeah and so I interviewed had a couple of days before he had to report the federal prison and tell this incredible saga of the guy that I really think was kind of just trying to save the world and then again got an all this trouble by crossing pass with a powerful corporation\nOf course we hear the term fake news a lot in the United states for fake news is in other presidential races this weekend\nIt is and Brazil where we sent Scott them and they say fake news is maybe one of the biggest problem with any country in the world according to polls they've taken and they have a presidential election this weekend at least part one of it and Scott is going to tell us about some of the fake news that circulate as best as social media\nAnd what they're trying to do passing laws are ways to we've passed that now I Want to caution that there's a whole lot of anti fake news effort\nAround the world and media literacy laws being path in this country and around the

Dr ... Ford says something to him and that's not an ally actually ballad\nDiscriminate or Terminator a ... of of someone's veracity so you know they they rightly blue blue pass them\nThen one last question on now um four witnesses were mentioned as being at the party that they could talk to they did talk to those ... I Believe they spent some three hours with mark judge had any of those four\nSaid anything that would have led the FBI to any sense of gee maybe there's something here they wouldn't sweep that under the rug now would they\nNot and ah look this is something that's very seriously they actually I did look at this from the perspective of the you know anytime you do an investigation like this if there are other leads would come up\nWhich a need to be looked at as they can turn of that information over for a criminal referrals so it's not like they didn't look and try to find it says they looked and they didn't say anything so this is where you know I think we need to be very clear on this\nAh it was very important for them to to be thorough to take those we can ask questions\nAnd and the other thing uh miss a tire or the or one of the witnesses against him in a ... one of the local attorneys representing her\nOr you know they've been very clear ... communications on this this is a supposedly the doctor for a best friend who backed up not one single thing\nOf Mrs Ford's allegations too including most importantly the fact that she didn't even know Brett Kavanaugh so let me tell you you know if I'm an investigator looking at this\nI I draw you know a very clear distinction between what is the fact\nThat people know versus what his opinion and people want to be projected onto Brett Kavanaugh I think that's again what happened here they were very clear\nAnd there was a report in the wall Street Journal um that was a I Would say somewhat troubling ah a friend of Christine Blasey Ford told FBI investigators that she felt pressured to clarify her original statement regarding the alleged sexual assault\nAnd that is in the wall Street Journal land that relates to Leland Kaiser\nRight what kind of the kinds of things I mentioned was is the problematic thing uh as I mentioned if you are doing one of these background checks and you find that there's a criminal issues\nAre these investigators may well issue criminal referrals so in this case a wreck frankly may go back to the other way where the primary witnesses which we're supposed to\nTo have some information to adverse nature on Kavanaugh may founded for efforts information on this for it in her legal team let me tell you that's no small issue and a lot of folks are calling for those who make false statements ... official statement to be prosecuted especially in this very tense environment\n[noise] All right I Want to turn to another story that was breaking yesterday and I'm a little bit overshadowed of course by the cabinet nomination process a headline\nFox News dot com lawyer for Clinton campaign and the DNC gave FBI documents for Russia probe tell us what's going on here\nYeah look this is a I think uh amazing reporting by Katherine Harris ... has been very consistent on this\nAnd this basically links uh provide the final link which I think a lot of this kind of suspected between how the steel ... and all the issues\nWith that first came to light to official channels to include the OJ and the FBI this is it this links uh Perkins coy the so called go between between the\nDemocratic National committee and Clinton Hillary Clinton campaign and official the OJ and one of the former eternity is a guy named Baker was I guess the source of a lot of this behind closed doors on on Capitol Hill\nWhat this means is it a after this contact ah they cook they the dear Jane FBI took this information current into what I Would term official real intelligence\nThey pretended this came from a government uh unbiased source and Kay Bartlett or they're all this\nWith some things John Brennan did to kind of pumped to prime the pump to focus on Russia became the foundation for the entire investigation against a per car Carter Page and the others\nSo this is kind of the I guess a form of Rosetta Stone this kind of gives you an understanding of for the pieces all kind of came together it's a very damning report it turns out to be completely true which I tend to believe it will and frankly there's needs to be some examination of how this happened how\nInformation funded by
