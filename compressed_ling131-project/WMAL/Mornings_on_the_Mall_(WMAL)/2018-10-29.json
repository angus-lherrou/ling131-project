speech on line they become radicalized by what they read by what they hear and when and then they do crazy things [noise] and uh so the idea\nThere being if the president points out issues we have to confront he's radicalizing people so there's a caravan of seven thousand people en route to the American border if you talk about that you are radicalizing your supporters well yes\nBecause you're a

yeah and and I agree I think it I Do believe it it is an invasion and um\nI I Believe you had mentioned uh when we were going into the break that um Mexico is starting to work with the president and you can see that they're ... they're starting to work with the president because there's some things that happened with this caravan over the weekend\nSo here here's some evidence of that ... that the ... the ... the caravan again from Honduras principally heading north word a has received offers from the Mexican government to stay in southern Mexico\nHere's the Associated Press story headlined we're heading north migrants next offer to stay in Mexico\nHundreds of Mexican federal officers carrying plastic shield block the Central American caravan from advancing toward the United states on Saturday after a group of several thousand migrants turned down\nThe chance to apply for refugee status and obtain a Mexican offer of benefits Mexican president Enrique Pena Nieto has announced what he called the quote you are at home plan\nOffering shelter medical attention schooling and jobs to Central Americans in Chiapas and\nA lot of guys that got said that right ah ah states if migrants apply calling it a first step towards permanent refugee status authorities said more than Seventeen hundred already applied for refugee status in other words the Mexicans are saying here's your chance stay here even call it the you are at home plan\nThey want to give them everything shelter medical attention school schools and jobs and yet they say no we're heading for America they apparently took a vote amongst themselves and said yeah no we're gonna keep gone we're going to America thanks ... what\nIf you're scraping the whole point is that your refugees fleeing from Honduras\nFor a reason that that is be fitting a refugee why wouldn't you take up Mexico's offer Mexico's offering you a better life Mexico has four times the average wealth per per citizen the Honduras does Mexico's opportunities Mexico is relatively low unemployment actually\nWhy not stay there why not stay in Mexico\nNo there is a country just north of you if they have birthright citizenship will go there thank you\n[noise] right well that's the thing and that's the key it's it's all about I clearly now we know this is about the benefits right because they can come to this country and everybody says oh they're not they're not entitled to benefits but as soon as you have a child that child's an American citizen that child is entitled to benefits\nThere you go ... is Mexico going to feed their kids in school breakfast and lunch every day because they're they're making below the poverty wage or whatever that it is to qualify now\nNot going to happen can can they can they get free health care in Mexico ... no probably not going to happen is the health care it's good of Mexico is it is here now\nThey're stupid they know exactly what\nThey're doing I Do think it's interesting that the trend here is that Mexico in the last year has played ball or at least demonstrated a capacity to do that with the Trump Administration way more than the president's domestic critics every would give him credit for\nSo in this case you have the Mexican government sort of almost on a daily basis with some other offer some other attempt to assist the United states in preventing this illegal immigrant care of him from making its way to the U.S border right simultaneously was just a couple of months ago the president announced a new trade deal\nAfter after saying he was a rip up NAFTA and who was first in the door was Canada or Mexico was Mexico and Mexico jumped on board and they were happy about it and then you hear that speaker phone call with the president of Mexico and the president of the United states talking about the warm embrace that the two men wanted to share\nSomething's changing\nAnd the presidents and the president's press critics are not giving him credit for that is an

on the ball joining us in one hour of legal news seven thirty ...\nOn the red skins win over the giants and any daytime tons per capita migrant amazing headed towards our southern border with a whole lot of questions for Heine marry well it was in the morning you know we've talked about the digital gap\nIn our culture the ideas that in America\nYou know the wealthy have access to technology and the poor not so much but one of the interesting phenomenon of the last decade or so is that suddenly there seems to be a strange reversal and I'll explain\nThe idea here is that is covered by the New York times this past week two two interesting stories that jumped out of me one is what they called the digital gap between rich and poor kids is not what we expected in other words that there's all these schools where they're promoting\nA digital only pre schools making sure that to keep more kids have screen time more kids have access to computers and tablets and the ability to have access to information from around the globe but the rich\nThe wealthy are increasingly banning screen time for their kids\nTrying to make sure that the screens or not and classes at all they want more traditional face to face learning they don't want screens in front of their kids\nWow and so and so now you have is a reversal where they were poor students whether or not you're poverty porn relative to the wealthy are more connected to screen time\nWe're poor students whether or not you're poverty porn relative to the wealthy are more connected to screen time\nMore screens and they're learning experiences\nAnd wealthier kids are further away from springs now\nAre separated from them not actually using them in their classroom experience\nAnd I have another store just like this but before I get that I Want to ask you this morning whether or not you govern your kids screen time and how important it is to you ate it eight six zero nine six two five eight eight eight six three zero W A L I can say for my own experience I I've got a a little kid a four year old I've talked about are all the time she's wonderful but one of the things\nSo I'm gonna I'm gonna question the honestly uh the respond within that we go in the ... century economy or in front of a screen make money and that's ...\nYeah I think I think what this is emanating out of thank you been doing it and I appreciate your your skepticism um the the surveys by common sense media it's supposedly a nonprofit media watchdog um but like the indications you're are you basically have you know this is not about the parents springtime that's and that's unique that's that is distinct from\nHow their children are being governed in terms of the use of their screen time so you basically higher income parents according to this New York times reporting there's two two pieces this weekend on that very subject that say that higher income parents are limiting their kids use a screen time despite the fact that they themselves may use it all the time every waking second of the day and that plays a role in it\nTo a very ... they're just very quickly um conversation that I had this week with um someone whose daughter's learning how to drive yeah and um she immediately turns to GPS on he's like why are you turning the GPS and she's like well to get wherever they like don't you know how to get there\nThey don't know landmarks they don't know ... street names that it ... when they write in the car their heads are down\nOn their screens they pay zero attention to the world around them zero well it's like I just realized that my teenager if I dropped her off somewhere like at the mall she can't get home because she doesn't pay any attention once they're in the back seat of the car as to how to get from point a to point B\nIt is funny I I tell you what when I get into a cab these days and by tell them my street address typically what I Try and do is tell them like a major road that's in the vicinity and then as we get there all navigate to the smaller plus\nA bunch of the cab drivers know exactly where to go I don't even need to tell them the macro details they know the micro details I could give them a house number and boom there'll be there no GPS nothing I mean just longtime cab drivers you know exactly how to get that I've always impresses me\nA specially in a world where GPS as ubiquitous and John is in Alexandria this morning John good morning or do you limit screen time period as\nMorning came to the Superbowl down here everybody doing granting here um hey guys\nI'm what six kids Fifteen to twenty nine I'm On the older end of the scale but what I've always done with each of them when they got old enough is just said you get good grades do well in school you keep doing what you're doing computer phone Katie whatever your great flip\nTaken everything away from ya and that's incentivize them all of them so far have done great I got engineers nurses and they're all doing very well but that I think you got to give in my opinion at least got to give them the benefit of the doubt let them do what's best for them and if it fails then I jumped at\nWhile kind of interesting good and this is and and it's interesting here John Say that because I did wonder about the impulsive like\nHow do you parent where you sort of are are being the helicopter ... were you overhang every waking moment every little detail of what's going on in their screens that kind of thing which amount of posted by the way the rewards there you're raising them you're you're you're raising your children is a different thing than how we deal with each other as citizens are but the government\nBut John saying hey\nYou know not going to come in there and and over the top govern their screen time unless they start losing productivity\nClinton I I agree I think it's up to each parent to do what they feel is best\nWas looking for more good advice this morning do you have some six twenty two

man it might be good money that it might be good money but\nI live in Virginia Good morning Eileen should we limit our kids springtime\nI think instead of thinking in terms of limiting their screen

the time right\nYeah I made sense to go Silicon Valley if your creative enough to invent smartphones your creative enough to come up with some activities for your kids out pumpkin carving this weekend\nBut when I think I think by having the screen as a go to I think kids don't learn how to entertain themselves there is the inability to sit and do nothing\nYou know they they they're not going to look like on board and they go find mom do we have any boxes and and create something out of that or do some kind of crept away like they're they're not they don't have that imagination

... how they did this is a they talked about the network exit polls after the twenty sixteen election showing the Trump winning a percent among black voters and twenty sixteen Hillary took eighty nine percent of the black vote according to exit polls no we don't know how ... how accurate they are what what people really say Bill Clinton when black voters by an eighty one percent\nBlack vote

found the Clinton had an even larger margin with black voters you put the numbers together it would mean that the president has doubled his lack support since the election\nSo very interesting numbers and then you see this you see a lot of young black kids in this country\nWho are saying wait a minute I'm opening my eyes and and and showing up at this event also this weekend do walk away movement

I think in our we rushed to blame we rushed immediately look to see which site is this person on instead and we looked to for a blame for something instead of just saying that sometimes\nPeople are crazy well sometimes people do crazy things and sometimes you know what there are people who are just evil story there are people who are just evil in this world\nYou know something I gotta say over the past week there's something interesting and I and I'm certainly not alone and having us experience but one of the things that happens when you look at these tragedies and you first start finding by graphical details at about the person generally what you know what's happening is\nLiberals are looking for ways to paint it to the president instantly you know like okay well we ... through this and figure out what his bio is\nI mean a lot of conservatives are looking through it from the perspective of okay let me find exculpatory details 'cause I Know the media is going to come out and accused the president right so what happens on Thursday and friday when we find out about this guy said or say oc and you see the side of his card covered in Trump stickers everyone's looking really close weather from stickers that\nNative Americans for Trump to see that splattered of the side of his car and I saw that I go okay so now it's going to happen is they're going to pretend like that sticker doesn't exist and just say it's a white guy and he's praised Trump and it was white\nPlastered to the side of his car and I saw that I go okay\nSo now it's going to happen is they're going to pretend like that sticker doesn't exist as you say it's a white guy and he's ... he was dropping it was white and it's your bad a bottle and you get this really stupid announces from the media and it's so entirely and thoroughly predictable that when you hear something like this detailed but this guy hated Trump he was an anti Semite he hated Trump for being ... to ... Jewish\nWithout the media speaking a word yet you and I both knew what was going to happen there we're going to accuse Trump of this and you are already won ... and you've already found these ... already tell instantly back to the press doesn't want to dollars\nNo absolutely and I think again I think sometimes we just need to acknowledge that some there's evil in the world and this guy is a prime example totally of of evil in this world and maybe that's he's maybe we blame the person instead of the object or somebody else for his actions seven twenty four a W I mail\nA Washington Post endorsed governor Hogan saying polarized times he you know to the political middle\nMillions of Maryland during a\nAnd trade approach on business\nSteady course on budgetary and fiscal matters\nHogan deserves a second term\nI ran for office was completely\nAt a fix that\nApple is adding washing\nI really don't care much about politics and whether someone who's a Democrat\nI care about common sense\nWe work together with local officials from the Iowa\nBut we respectfully agree to disagree and we're obviously\nPeople appreciate\nIT or distribution stories from CD WG a government agency needed to prepare for the future but an IT infrastructure was stuck in the past or CD WG\nOrchestrated a converged infrastructure solution between deli AMC technology and\nModernize their data center using the industry's most innovative infrastructure portfolio\nService in storage buy Dell id are constrained by TV WG more needy WG dot com slash do CDW gee people who get it [noise]\nSeven twenty five ...

just a pull back for a second look at the political map of all of this\nI can tell you live last week was the Taliban anything the Democrats are are wanting to say or not say\nTalking about immigration caravan thousands of illegal immigrants making the weight of the United states is not something Democrats want to be doing and it's almost a master ... for the president to come out tomorrow and you have a speech where he talks about the fundamental things he's doing to stop the movement of this caravan because it'll force Democrats to stay focused on\nThe thing the president would rather they'd be focused on how does the election where voters are polling in the president's direction they want to care of an invasion to be stopped\nWhat you're right about that but you know it's it's so interesting saying Democrats wanting to avoid talking about it when this caravan is the natural result of all the policies they've been\nPushing they've been pushing open borders sanctuary cities are creating\nAn illegal aliens once they get into the country just like citizens and most importantly they were out protesting\nSaying well we need to get rid of ... rid of eyes so what does all of that going to do all of that is a temptation at a a I'm encouraged\nThat the illegal aliens to head for the U.S border\nThe Mexican government offered these migrants food shelter medical care education jobs if they stayed in the southern states of Mexico and they voted and said no we're we're coming to the U.S\nSo we've noted during the show here that Mexico seems to be cooperating more with President Trump than they have with previous presidents are they cooperate anymore or did President Trump is somehow give them some kind of deal as lucky you keep them will pay for a\nWhile there's been no indication of that kind of deal and and if I look at it it's great if they offered that to them but um why haven't they actually stop them from moving through the country I mean I Wonder whether this is all just kind of on the surface\nMaking trying to make it look like the Mexican government is doing something on that because they haven't done anything to actually stop the caravan from migrating north and they have it arrested any of these individuals and and basically a return them back over the border\nYeah they did your right to be skeptical but I think the whole experience does and what we saw with Mexico this past week that they made an offer like this and that these Honduran migrants are rejecting it outright in favor of going to the United states really demonstrates that we're dealing with here is not genuinely a refugee crisis because if it was\nThey would happily take up a residency in Mexico having fleeing from the oppression of Honduras instead they're headed for the United states ...\n... you're you're right and particularly because if they really really had grounds for asylum they could easily assert that in Mexico Mexico has had an asylum\nLaw uh since two thousand eleven that actually brought or has the asylum law the United states\n... vice president Mike Pence did say that uh he alluded to this being funded by quote unquote outside groups has proven that there is someone or a group organizations outside that are funding is organizing this because it doesn't look very well coordinated\nOr is there any kind of prosecution or any kind of retaliatory measures that the United states can take [noise]\nI I don't know there there are um there are provisions in federal immigration law a over assisting at encouraging uh illegal aliens to break the law that I could possibly be used but it really all depends on what kind of facts they could uncover a with regard to that\nAll right well ... thank you so
