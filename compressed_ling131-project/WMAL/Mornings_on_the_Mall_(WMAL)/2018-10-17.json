opaque\nTo to us so if the drug costs more than thirty five dollars a month\nThat's the cut off of it will cost you more than thirty five dollars a month for that prescription this legislation would force the drug companies to publish that in their TV ads so when you see the couples holding hands in matching bathtubs in the middle of a field\nStill don't understand that and they always want to

it's very expensive I'm so glad you brought that up Bobby because there is a vehicle that does exist\nThat you can use and what it what it does is you put in whatever drug it is that you're looking

yeah and uh like I said they do have one for pets as well which a lot of people need that one Charles in Germantown good morning Charles urine mornings on them all what do you think about this proposed legislation [noise]\nWell I I personally think that um it's probably not too bad [noise] I've actually had health insurance for myself and my family in two thousand and all of my medication or doctor bills I have the cash for about\nA last year I went to the doctor 'cause I had a sinus infection and they prescribed some antibiotics and so I called to find out how much it was going to cost\nIt was like over a hundred and some dollars well at that time I didn't have that much money but I caught that the doctor and she said oh no problem we have a coupon\nSo I Believe the medication with like a hundred and fifty or something like that and the coupon I got to pay\nTwenty five dollars whoa whoa there's an extreme cost like I said I paid cash for everything and [noise]\nUm yeah I mean I think drugs can be a lot less than than what people thing\nYeah they you know it's interesting Charles I'm Glad you brought this up thank you so much and check out our ex too because\nThey they made a coupon things or to rent their access to ... pens it all depends on the farm and see the the gag rule thing this involved here\nSo if I'm correct me if I'm wrong but what it sounds as one of my understanding of it is that pharmacist in some states are blocked from telling you that you could save money okay so I'm I'm reading this year from the New York times\nThey're blocked in some states from telling customers that they could save money by paying cash rather than using insurance they can't tell the customer you know you could be paying less for the wow that's interesting

very good question Mary you I mean he was a columnist or Washington Post\nAnd uh see as a specially by the left of America was touted as being a democratic reformer but as I say on my column tomorrow\nOr he was anything buddy joined the Muslim Brotherhood in Nineteen Seventy as a matter of fact he was a\nA lecturing or been Solomon be uh suppose grit former a crown prince of Saudi Arabia or that he was against a secular state he was against the modernization\nOf Islam he was very much for history of law and the imposing a point of view on uh the rest of the world and to rid a Muslim country so western influence\nSo I I Know selection of post editorial the other day a was a pretty much in the pocket of those who believe that he was a reformer I think that's a very dangerous thing I think the issues here\nEverybody should condemn anyone who was murdered in the world I don't care who it is yes I have a the idea tapering him over and pretending that he has some kind of great reformer I think is a very dangerous thing but typical of western thinking I Would say\nNow isn't it true that the reforms he was calling for not to liberalize Saudi Arabia they weren't to make them more because he was he was he was opposed to the secularization and liberalization of Saudi Arabia he wanted to see it go back and the other direction\nAbsolutely right and uh I'm sort of go some of the love and then by the way I just read today and that one of the media counsel I didn't know before that uh that ... and Osama bin Laden were schoolmates I'd like to see that your book\n[laughter] wow what a one year book the press has an interest in I Know that uh\nYou know remember Osama bin Laden was was opposed to any kind of liberalism a young or at least what they regarded as liberalism in Saudi Arabia yeah he was an old fashioned a Muslim a conservative but he would he couldn't believe that women driving or being equal amount at all so\nYou know I think we have to look beyond the beyond us the middle east is a very complex area\nAnd a lot of the Saudi you said many others here no the westerners want to hear they like to hear words like democracy and tolerance any quality they use those words when speaking to the west and they use a completely different words or ... different meanings when they speak to their own people\nContent I Want to move on to a President Trump and
