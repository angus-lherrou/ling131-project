A. chartered a a a task force of national experts and domestic violence and intimate partner violence\nAnd um what they came up with was a fourteen recommendation planned for v ha to implement and it's part of violence assistance program and so from that that was the inception of the intimate partner violence assistance program based on those rights\nAnd it's been a part of the violence assistance program and so from that\nThat was the inception of the intimate partner violence assistance program based on those recommendations so in January two thousand fourteen\nThey began a rapid implementation program with six the a medical centers around the country from that time from two thousand fourteen 'til now well actually until April two thousand Eighteen the\nWhen we were talking about a screening and how veterans women veterans in particular have the opportunity to talk to their health care providers about intimate partner violence if they're experiencing it\nSo exciting thing intimate partner balance can bring on many factors can you speak to us about the effects of intimate partner violence as it relates to family and life ... dress isolation anger possibly leading to alcoholism or use of substances can you talk to us about that\nShort let me start with some numbers so it gives you an idea of really where we are with intimate partner violence let me preface it by saying that it is not an easy situation to admit to so those who are admitting to it as very courageous for them to do that\nBut it's hard to really get fool and accurate numbers of level of intimate partner violence so the general population the rate of women experiencing intimate partner violence is basically one out of three women\nFor men in the general population that's one out of four four women veterans twice as much no case so if you have the same three women if their veterans is two out of three bedroom limit reporting experience of intimate partner violence\nFor veteran then it's two out of four so half again that increases twice as much as general population\nWe know that women admit to intimate partner violence more so than men but moving on it impacts everything all aspects of living whether it's medical with his physical emotional social economic\nI'm spiritual just to name some of the health conditions that can worsen we're talking about either increase an appetite decreasing appetite if it's an increase an appetite you're talking about on any associated health concerns with being overweight\nArthritis chronic pain increases asthma can increase\nGastrointestinal problems like irritable bowel syndrome can increase\nThe risk for a TGI which is a traumatic brain injury hypertension can occur cardiovascular issues socially you talking about social isolation which is what you already pointed out trust issues and relationships and women and men who are experiencing I.

deficient in vitamin D\nAnd because of that deficiency it's causing health issues like pain muscle weakness immune problems and the most vitamin D supplements are not the best form and more importantly is not the right amount of vitamin D to really make an impact is that what you're saying\nYeah same here it's it's a multifaceted problem where one\nWe're not getting enough vitamin D three hundred system ... vitamin D trees are responsible for activating two thousand different genes in the body controlling everything from diabetes to hormone production to muscle strength heart beating correctly digestion immune system\nIt's a really long list and honestly it surprised me because of medical school we learned that vitamin D was necessary for the bones we get enough being outside and in our milk and end of story right down for the first twenty something years I practice I never prescribe vitamin D I just didn't think\nIt was necessary and then in the early to thousands of this study started coming out and now there is over twenty three hundred and studies\nShow that vitamin D is absolutely necessary it's not just a good idea it's absolutely necessary it's a hormone that shouldn't be in the body and it's not there\nAnd you share some of that research Dr ... and more importantly what's the conclusion of the research related to vitamin D\nWell one of the biggest studies ever on them and the for from the U.S navy okay\nSo I think it was like a hundred and forty five thousand men and women were study and they found that the number one non combat reason that people died in the navy was due to the melanoma so skin cancer so I'm reading study you know I I kind of hot as right there and went yeah makes sense you know people are out on the deck of shift\nIn the equator and all over the world and they're getting into her but you know you're young raise and and they're developing skin cancer but then I read on and it said most of the victims were office workers like clerks and people in hangers and inside and I went home I thought it was a link going back to vitamin D deficiency in the body\nWhat about muscle and bone stream ... three formula help with that\nYeah it's critical like if you're someone that's over fifty especially you're seeing a progression of the core muscles in your body starting to slow down\nFor it's it's kind of a cleansing

D three's a day for the first week or two to get your thoughts as quickly\nSo let me ask you about these gummy vitamins does that work can you put enough vitamin D into a little gummy bear in is that the best way to get it in your body\nOf course that Chris you know they'll go to any type of lengths to try to market things that thing good about you're taking a lot of sugar and ... my thing is it's

five I'll give it to you again it's one eight hundred\nEight to seven one to zero five if you're just joining us I've got Dr Michael is on the phone today and we're talking about something that we're all too familiar with these days in that stress\nAnd we're finding out about the damage that everyday stress can do to our bodies the warning signs that we should be aware of and what we can do to alleviate and even eliminate the effects of stress\nAnd Dr ... you were talking earlier about calcium and magnesium and how we need these nutrients in our bodies to fight the effects of stress in your ... formula\nCan help us in the battle against stress\nI'd like to talk for a minute about how the magnesium\nFactors in I mean uh I'm starting to understand about the calcium but what does magnesium\nToo we are talking about stress and we're talking about dress affects the body and well first of all in order to function at all your body needs magnesium is probably of all the vitamins I could lift magnesium is probably the most important vitamin on the planet right now\nI've not heard a whole lot about magnesium ... why is making it seem so important\nThere's over three hundred and twenty five\nBio chemical reactions that many things involved with it's almost like a hormone wow and a very low levels of magnesium you're going to be\nVery important factor in life and I would say so in fact let me just read a list of some of the conditions are associated with magnesium deficiencies okay um you have attention deficit disorder Alzheimer's\nOr anxiety asthma autism\nChronic fatigue syndrome congestive heart disease cost the patient diabetes fiber at my job high blood pressure is he a migraine headaches multiple sclerosis muscle cramps Parkinson's not due process and the list just goes on and on and on\nAnd this is this is associated with a a lack of magnesium and the money\nSimply a lack of magnesium bully too so it's nothing that really mess around with that what happens is that we need that many of them in your body in order for the count them to be absorbed\nThough so it's it's a necessary thing in order to get the first phone which is ...\nThat's right they work in combination with each other\nAbout there's many more practical applications of this ... formula mhm first of all like I said you drink it so it gets into your system and one of the first thing we use it for in our clinic\nIs for people who are under a lot of traffic and it can't sleep well at night it works better than anything I've ever seen for people that have trouble flip it really because it relaxes you ride any do actually fill the relaxation after you drink the after you drink a cup of counteract formula\nInteresting\nThe other thing that it's really really good for our people who are in pain [noise]\nOkay and I have a whole bunch of stories to tell you and and the case studies of people actually taking account max formula and getting rid of pain and this is including arthritic Taipei and fibromyalgia which is a form of arthritis back pain muscle spasms migraine headaches there's a whole category of of area that like to discuss with you\nWhile that's fantastic some of those things that you name seem to be age related or or things that we experience as we grow older is there a link there\nYeah there's a vicious circle that I'd like to discuss what happens is that when a person had\nA magnesium deficiencies many of them they don't absorb their food and so they go into what we call mal absorption syndrome which millions and millions of Americans have and it's not like you feel sick or you know they said that he might be overtime just starting to feel more tired tired and tired mhm and that's just a real graduate overtime type of thing\nAnd like you feel sick or you know this might be over time just starting to feel more tired and tired and tired mhm and that's just a real gradually overtime type of thing and a lot of people justify that they're getting old and they just need more breast or whatever right that that's what I Would think\nThat what happens is that when when you get less absorption you actually increase the efficiency in your system of magnesium\nWhen that and that started to take the count them out of the bones you start getting bone loss you start getting a lot because it also reduces the muscle mass and pretty soon before you know you are feeling old you and your body's actually starting to manifest\nIt well all due to a simple lack of these nutrients\nOut there and let me tell you and it is simple the problem and being a doctor researchers how do you get this into the system\nThe formula we have the counteract formula is so fantastic because powder form you take hot water and you make if you put it in a cop tickets to sort of this powder and mix it in yeah and you drink that's cut down on my ... is really incredible because it actually goes right into your ...\nAnd this is probably a good time folks

specifically calcium and magnesium\nAnd how much of an impact that has on our overall health so I guess one of the things that people should really be aware of is because this is an instant thing that triggers you just say oh I'm sick but you know instead of happens gradually over time\nIt's very possible that people might not even be aware that there is a deficiency of calcium and magnesium and their body\nWell that's the thing is that a deficiencies are not like I'm a water main break in or you have written noticeable thing to say they're little trips little leagues here and there and so what we have is a cumulative effect where a person starts to go downhill just a little bit at a time to the point where they don't realize how bad they've actually gotten before it's too late\nTo pick his you'd mentioned insomnia we talked about that a little bit what about back pain\nCalcium and neither is excellent for back pain because the calcium goes into the muscles magnesium actually helps the translators and the nurse and when you take this comebacks formula many times they will calm your back pay well I Know I run by a couple of years ago I herniated disc and my back and I was trying

and you know things have happened to us or maybe during the week or the previous week or whatever\nBut I was thinking today I'm I'm really not being bugged right now by too many things in my personal life but I Am bugged when people say to me\nThat when they retire they're going to spend less money okay I Am bug by that and I know that's not true because ... you and I are experiencing that 'cause we are semi retired I mean we still do what we love but ah but you know for the most part I mean we are semi retired we've delegated a lot of our practice\nOut to a you know our our children are are we know we do have a family business and certainly all of the advisors that that plug into it so we've got\nA a system that's really kind of on cruise control for the most part but one thing that I haven't really noticed is that my expenses have not gone down as a fact retirement may be much much more costly than you think and I'll just you know mentioned a few things that from my own personal experience\nThat has caused this number one I think people don't factor in big ticket items I mean when they look at their budget and they say well I've got my needs\nTaken care of I understand that right and that's really obviously a very very important thing but how about your once okay and you have your wants taken care of\nI mean don't overlook a big ticket items like a on a new car that you might need or want or ah repairs to your home which do you get more and more expensive [noise]\nUh and certainly things that you know maybe we don't budget for and so big ticket items are one of the things that\nAre really you'd you know a lot of people don't consider also changing spending habits are right now in our personal experience I found what can I here's my thought process what can I buy now that I deserve okay or that I didn't have when I was\nYou know working full time that I didn't even have time to enjoy or a you know the money to to use a for that particular project\nI have an idea okay a boat above it yes some of the idea that I Am by about ... and an in addition to those vacation okay rabble\nWe love to do you know hobbies I mean I guess I could put my boat as ... as a hobby\nBut these things cost a lot of money All right and so you don't consider these things how 'bout lending money to kids ... okay that's another one now we have learned not to try to do that but the the uh we are guilty of that ourselves or spoiling grandkids that's one I can say that's a that's a a not at the\nRight and that's yeah that's why I Want to spoil them even in our parents have style I mean look at my mom for example she Chet Turner eighty years old and she has talked of ever since I can remember since I was six years old she had talked about taking a trip to the holy land okay you know and it's just like how\nThat turned eighty years old and she has talked ever since I can remember since I was six years old she has talked about taking a trip to the holy land okay you know and that's just like\nHow many years ... you know Seventy ... some odd years later she's still talking about I said mom now at the time we actually are just selling a house that we've owned with her together and we're going to now have the money did you know for her to do that and but\nBut I still in the ... we don't but we don't have to a company that's\nOut there for I don't have your free time really to what we already out there don't address but we just did it like two years ago so I mean we're not going to go back there again like next year okay and they do the point maybe a year and a ...\nFoot okay how about the uh let's get back on task okay how about fees that's another one we don't consider and the big one ... the big one that people just don't consider our taxes okay and we think of these are ways we look at our arteries and our for one case in her ... and we say well jeeze I've got you know\nThree hundred thousand dollars in there well guess what our acts up All right all taxable so you know maybe twenty five or even thirty percent of that is not your money that's money that has to be\nThat go towards the the you know Texas and do these are things that we consider and that's why the rash strategy Loretta such a great alternative to an IRA or four one K. you talk about the rash strategy to retirement approach ... tax\nIn the book I Want you to kind of some of the highlights of that but before you do we want to make sure and get a copy of the raft strategy in your hands along with brochures and booklets and and I'm the most important thing of course is the illustration that we provide for you\nThat will show you how these work why they work maybe while your financial advisor hasn't told you about um there's a lot of consideration or give us a call or

seven five five calls\nOr check and provide your main female ... eight six six five four four Seventy seven shifts\nSo another point on the back of this book that says use IRS rules to make Uncle Sam your partner or not you're so\nOkay so to me we're not all that happy some kinds of higher ed simply because we have to keep on paying taxes\nAnd while we were ... so we have to write a check for always writing checks the IRS\nRight but there are some parts that were ecstatic\nAbout knowing that we have made Uncle Sam our partner and how did we do that\nWhat we did is Ronald rap strategy yeah there we we employ some of the the you know we do eat or on cocaine we have a three three rats strategy accounts right now that are going to provide and we still haven't\nEven taken income from them or at this time but certainly the you know part of the plan is that we are going to start taking tax free income from those in the next few years and that will provide you know a lot of a benefit here not only a living benefit which we receive but it also provides step in effect in addition to that so it's\nNot something we're to strains that David ... created and come up with some idea\nThat it's just like they were the printer has been around for a while she'll seeming ... yeah there you go the other hand you're laid back from the Nineteen eighty okay but here's the thing\nThis is not an old

you know we have our own accounts and we have a couple of wrath strategies going on our own behalf\nBut we don't mention a whole lot to each one of our children also and in fact are are are one of our oldest son's Tanner who works at that directly in our business here he called me yesterday says you know my wife is adamant that I get her own\nRaft strategy started because you know he's got his and then she says and and not only that we want one on each of the children as well so\nHe's got he's got a little project at me because I've got to create all of these accounts for each of the children as well now why in the world would he want to do that tell it was\nSo I mean you know certainly uh uh well I Know why his wife wants to bring you\nKnow she's she wants her own security I mean she's a very independent person and let's just say that Tanner or you know died okay yes she would get a ballooning benefit from his 'cause the beneficiary but she wants to have\nHer own lifetime income right and not only yeah and only the lifetime income can only\nGo to the person that actually owns the account so from that perspective I think that um ah that that's probably some of her reasoning and then the children I mean certainly for college education that ... are coming up around the corner\nAnd the beauty of the rash strategy is is that it can be utilize you can access at the child can access that tax free uh to supplement or to altogether pay for a they're continuing education after they graduate from high school\nI think ... I mean it's just a foundational part as anybody's ... financial planning\nI you know and the other thing that our children are doing that I'm really proud of is that they're educating their shoulder\nA and I think that this is such an important thing to do educating them in the area of finances and they're beginning that process early and often and these are things that are so important for us to do a because you know our children don't get the education in in in school and they don't they don't receive at so\nAnyway get the book at the illustration and get started get your questions answered the number to call or text us one eight six six five four four Seventy seven fifty five [noise]\nTo get your free rap strategy say this call or text and your name email and just go to eight six six five four four seven seven by by just call or text and provide your name female ends it shows a six five four Seventy seven ... so I think it's time for this style\n[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n\n[laughter]\nAm hearing that not to bring that back you know the ... the Tonight Show it's just not the same sorry about that but you know it was\nThis month in October of Nineteen sixty two the Johnny Carson took over from Jack Parr\nAs the host of that late night talk program the Tonight Show and Carson went on to host the Tonight Show starring Johnny Carson for three decades becoming one of the biggest figures in entertainment in the twentieth century\nThere wasn't a person in America there still isn't that\nHasn't seen or heard of Johnny Carson and absolutely amazing entertainer who feel their house with laughs and wondered night after night after night it was just such a pleasure to watch him work\nThirty years of consistent quality programming from Johnny Carson if only the rat our retirement plans could deliver such linked inconsistency well you know why I think they have\nThe the raft strategy I Wish I could talk like I had been banned but yeah so the ... you know the retirement approach free of tax I mean our we've been talking about this on the radio now for Fifteen\nYears so you know what entice me when I first started my first one and this is like ten years ago okay that I started my first draft account is I\nI I actually did the numbers and I realized that if I were to put aside fifty thousand a year for five years that two hundred fifty thousand dollars right and then wait another five years to start you know before I start taking distributions\nUh I was actually able to take out\nAround forty thousand dollars per year but if I wait another five years after that it's actually more about Seventy five thousand dollars per year okay you forgot the magic words every year tax free tax rates Seventy five thousand so this is why did it I like I said in that because I Want Seventy five thousand dollars a year coming to me tax free\nBecause I feel like when I'm sixty five years old that's going to be it's going to go a long way towards getting me everything I Need to me my daily\nNavy or you know it's so interesting how we actually got into this business for ... years ago I had a a at the time I owned a mortgage company and of course like many\nA mortgage brokers and uh you know folks that were in that business we were helping people to access equity of their homes and are there was so much equity going on you know the real estate boom was going\nStrong and there was all these creative financing tools uh that uh you know eventually actually caused the collapse of of a lot of\n... and I have to value not tend to read that here's the thing I remember you coming home at night and sane and this is actually written the book\n... I'm not feeling great about these mortgages I think that there's going to be held to be paid I years later when if what if what if something happens in the market and you call day why are they for\nI think that anyone that was in the business at that time probably unless they were really not engaged in what was going on they were probably suspicious of how this would all turn out\nAnd certainly the federal government should have been aware of it but they weren't so or at least they didn't appear to be a bottom line is is that as we access that people would turn to us at the at the table and say you know what do I do with this money and you know we didn't think that it was prudent at that time to invest that money in the stock market\nOdd because obviously home equity\nIs I said great I mean that's something that you ever want to lose your polling that money out of it you have to create arbitrage with the money in order to make it work because obviously there's a cost\nTo accessing that home equity money and ah I read a book at that time by an author called dug by the name of Doug ... Salt Lake city is called a missed fortune and you know when I read that book I was like wow this is amazing this whole strategy that he's come up with\nAnd so we basically ah you know plugged into a lot of what he did and then of course we uh uh brought into it our own spin on on a number of things and we created the rats strategy or and so now we were as we access that we could ... here because\nThis money is safe it's liquid and it'll give you a great tax free rate of return and that sort of how our practice was formed\nAnd then after after a short period of time we decided well you know it's probably in our best interest and everybody else that we're working with to not do the mortgage is I mean we're not feeling good about those mortgages let's just help people\nUtilize maybe phones that they have outside of their home equity perhaps it's in the bank or savings or you know or maybe even money that you would normally spend on on other things to access that and put it into the rest strategy and that's our practice\nRight for them and what was so remarkable is during two thousand\nNormally spend on on other things to access that and put it into the strategy and that's our practice\nRight for them and what was so remarkable is during two thousand age when we had a number of people had had already engaged in the rats strategy we got so many calls in so many letter

pretty good for five years okay to maybe seven years\nIf you make a change for instance when I re did my bathroom at my house uh and it was in two thousand and seven it's now just now starting to look a little bit dated but not quite because we were ahead of the trend we went to where we felt like the trend was going back then I hear it's eleven years later\nIf you look at houses where you might have put in what oftentimes I hear a new kitchen in two thousand you'll see that the style the coloring the choices of cabinet tree or or tile and so on for that era actually dated to around two

to change my roof because it's old\nWe don't advise you either okay just because something's old doesn't need doesn't mean it needs replacing think about when you change things at your house there are those who would have a a a home inspector would come in and say hey I think you're going to need to and you say okay I'm going to go ahead and do it so I don't have to worry about it\nThat would be the exception to the rule the majority wait till something breaks in real estate sales unless your house is a ... in every way and therefore having a really old furnished doesn't make sense of the resale\nLet it be it would be less expensive than putting ten thousand or Fifteen thousand dollars into HVAC equipment for you know instead\nFocus your attention on giving the buyers two or three years of a home warranty\nIt's only five to six hundred dollars a year that's what it costs you out of your pocket and guess what you get coverage for your plumbing your heating your electrical all the major systems in your house all the way from the point you sign that document\nUntil settlement so outlets that house now will be getting ready will go on the market in February or march or April\nThat house doesn't settle until June or maybe even July or may depending upon your choice and during that entire time you is the owner the property don't have to worry about something breaking because if it does you call the warranty company it's one of the miracles real estate now I don't think it's a main reason why people by\nDon't have to worry about something breaking because if it does you call the warranty company it's one of the miracles and real estate now I don't think it's the main reason why people buy a house and let me get get that clear it's a main way for you to overcome the fear that someone will have an objection about a really old piece of equipment that you have [noise]\nPlus you get the benefit seriously okay so this is the [laughter] the business model this is just their business model they don't come out and look at your house it's not like insurance for a car or something where they check your car make sure they're no dang so you don't claim a dang\nWhen they're already was one right it's more like they want you to sign up they know they're going to lose money the first year and what they want to do is give you the benefit of having that assurance that if something does break than you are insured and can get it fixed it replaced\nThe buyer you're giving the buyer one or two or three years let's say you give us three you're home warranty to a buyer\nThat's gonna cost you Fifteen hundred Eighteen hundred dollars to give them a short ... that is\nOne fifth of ten thousand dollars even a little bit less than that okay\nAnd so you're giving them for a fraction of the cost to kind of peace of mind that they don't have to worry about the air conditioner or the heat are breaking between now and three years between the settlement day and three years later\nAnd then they can renew that warranty if they want to for another five years and they'll have only paid another three thousand bucks you follow okay and it not only covers the first ... all the major systems\nIt's all relative bargain for you as a cellar\n[noise] do you do a home inspection before you put your house on the market I don't advise it unless you happen to know but you have a major defects somewhere in your house and you need to get an engineer to check it out\nI took a listing the sweet lady had been in the house for about Fifteen Years\nAnd she her entire garage floor had sunk it was like like a crater was like a a giant beast sat down on the concrete floor and it sunk from the edges down into the middle\nNow clearly from what I could tell what happened was the ground underneath the concrete where the garage floor was was not compacted effectively or there was would in that ground underneath the dirt that it just slowly rotted away over time and it's settled out\nWe hired an engineer it cost her seven hundred dollars she got word that the entire structure of her garage was safe and sound that there was no major problems even though there was a crack in a brick wall off the back of it [noise]\nSo we just brought in a contractor who put concrete over the top and provided that engineers letter to resolve the question that would obviously come from a buyer when they saw that crack\nIt's important that you not create more work for yourself if you hire a home inspector to come in and they look at your property and they say you've got you know three things going on here where you've got Fifteen things going on here or twenty five things going on here you're going to have to fix everything they find\nYou're going to have to disclose that you have the issue why spend five hundred dollars of your own money to do that when the buyers are going to get a home inspection anyways and they're going to want to get a pound of flesh for the five hundred dollars a day spent and you're going to give it to 'em anyways doesn't that make more sense [noise]\nI Try to be very straightforward with you I tried to tell you exactly

Allen\nTo share her thoughts\nHave you been trying to decide\nWhere you want to retire to\nHold a few minutes I'm going to have Christina parade is what the angles side [noise] I came for him as a guest on the show but first I Want us to think about if you're thinking about relocating out of the area my advice is that you evaluate\nAny community like you're climbing Mount Everest okay why is that because it was you know a climate where near this summer and there were stages in the ...\nFirst day we climbed up a thousand feet we would rest then from there get a chance to look around and see what it was like continue on up from there\nAs you as you think about where you may go you might want to go to a town that you'd think you'd like to relocate to and just spend a week there\nAnd maybe planned a trip to visit for towns now might be a little bit expensive maybe it'll drive the trip but rent a home\n'cause you don't necessarily need to be in an apartment there you could go to an apartment or a hotel you could also go to our video sometimes retirement communities will have\nTests apartments not common but sometimes they do\n[noise] you know if you think about it when you get to Everest there is an application process in fact it takes Seventy four days on average to climb Mount Everest Seventy four days from the beginning trekking in it's about a twenty four day round trip just to Base Camp\nAnd then you spend approximately four and a half weeks going through the process of actually climbing the mountain because the application that's required is so great\nMt Everest is twenty eight thousand plus melt when he was only fourteen for ten but when you get over a thousand feet above sea level you you start not to get the same amount of oxygen and you have to acclimate if you spend any amount of time in that area\n[noise] so your first trip you might last week gives you a chance to drive through see the neighborhoods see the golf courses if that's of interest to visit a couple of churches maybe arriving late on a Saturday and leaving the following Sunday afternoon if that's important to you\nSo if if their first trip is promising your second trip you might say okay let's go back there again unless spend three weeks\n[noise] try to get see if you get tired see if you get bored\n[laughter] there's no sense in buying a location putting yourself in a position of ownership somewhere unless you really see yourself living there a lot of the time I have friends who own homes and a couple of different locations\nAnd those ... one place and they'll come back to the
