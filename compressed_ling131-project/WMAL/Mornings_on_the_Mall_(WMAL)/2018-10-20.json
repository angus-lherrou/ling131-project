it's not a broker dealer certified financial planner or register investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nSome of the do yourself investor show this is Chris ... and during the do's and don'ts for the financial markets big science or sponsors Tom laundry academy contribution makes his show possible [noise] online training\nAcademy has been helping individuals like you've become do yourself investors since Nineteen Ninety seven\nOnline training Academy of two campuses to serve our listening audience one in Tyson's corner and one near BWI Airport and now that we have market volatility back we're getting people in with a lot more conviction and a lot more motivation\nTo prepare themselves for the markets volatility markets ups and markets downs guy so a week ago when the market was plummeting down ten percent we have people came in and they saw there's a real threat to their wealth\nAnd you know if your money and a four one K. your money is always at risk\nAnd it's taking these market hits but you very rarely get the nice bounce back on the outside and for most folks just to realize we're at\nThat ... you know during this week if you had all of your money in the S. and P. five hundred then you'd be lucky to be a break even and then then you have to subtract out the fees and expenses which makes it less likely that you would even be a break even for the year\nAnd so when you're taking a look at this from a long term perspective and look at it from as a business person you know you're going to have appears in down years but why on earth would you allow that to happen it'd be philosophical about it okay once you want to be able to learn is there a way that I can protect what I've got\nAnd take some steps to actually be making progress on a regular basis in the market\nAnd for a lot of our students they come to us because they have assets and they're tired of this roller coaster and you were able to get complacent over the last few years over the last few years market didn't do a whole lot so you were able to sit back and relax and you know see what might happen but\nYou know this year has been very clear from February and April into June and to September and October the gums were happening and so these guns for the warning signs that at a moment's notice the folks with money are going to want to protect themselves and so part of being a do yourself investor\nIs realizing that one of the most important things you can do is learn how to protect the Capitol you've worked so hard for\nMe right you know you've earned that capital by the sweat of your brow you pay taxes on the capital and then you have to defend that capital from all those things and wanting to spend money on it\nAnd what's leftover that's there for you to invest them for you to be able to bind productive uses for those assets and you know throughout this process people's expectations have been beaten down and if you're getting single digit returns and you're happy with it\nYou gotta just recognize your being happy with unproductive uses of your assets your assets if you're gonna if if you put it in the sweat blood sweat and tears to earn that capital then you should be looking for double and triple digit opportunities for that capital and if you're not is because you're thinking too small [noise]\nAnd we see this over and over again I said do yourself investor you know the first thing you have to do is learn how to protect your capital second you have to learn how to position your capital absurd you have to learn how to profit from the capital and we're talking about profiting we're not talking about three four or five percent\nYou know I had the banks are bragging about one or two percent interest you know if you have your money and he has to be five hundred you're lucky if you break and even if your money's and bombs you know the bonds are breaking down so the value of your bombs is going down so\nWith these battered expectations why are you going to allow yourself to absorb another big hit to your net worth we've already seen this movie before right back in two thousand eight two thousand nine and most people last forty to fifty percent of their net worth\nWe've seen some people who lost Ninety percent of their financial network during that time and back in two thousand two thousand and one same story you know on average people last forty to fifty percent of their financial assets\nAnd some people lost Ninety percent or Ninety five percent\nAnd so ask yourself this you've worked hard for that money why on earth aren't you getting a self educated as to how you can protect it in this current market environment and then also why don't you learning how to position it and do some things where you can get some safer and smarter returns\nAnd you know I saw an article is Michelle Singletary Washington Post and\nIt was talking about this you know successful young woman who is in her thirties that had saved a lot of money she put a lot of money in her four one K. [noise] I think she has something like eight hundred thousand dollars she owned a sensible condo she had her expenses in line and the experts\nIt's like eight hundred thousand dollars he owned a sensible condo she had her expenses in line and\nThe expert was saying well you know she should just be happy she's in all these things well and then instead of using that money more productively keep doing what she's doing maybe she can reduce or fees and expenses by a little bit\nBut with no stock market risk\nWe can do similar things and expose ourselves to other markets if we don't like the stock market up side so we can still have our money outside and absorb no stock market risk generate income and then we can buy call options on other assets\nThat you have seemed to have the wind out their back\nAnd so we know oil right now is they're charging up you know we've got excitement in the middle east or got excitement in other oil producing nations we've got a public policy that his focus on driving the price of oil up\nAnd so in that case you know maybe that's a strategy that you could use to help protect yourself and give you some peace of mind and it's part of positioning your money away from the the high risk in the stock market but still give you the opportunity for beneficial returns and so\nPart of what we help you do start looking at your money differently and start thinking bigger about the opportunities around you\nSo you don't have to be a victim of whatever the market throws at us next and you know we're starting to see you know people steps are getting you know they see that the end is near\nBut people aren't willing to take a position\nWhere they're protecting themselves right now well that's the perfect time to start protecting yourself\nYou know as the market charges up again this is the perfect time if you weren't if you didn't get your money out of harm's way the last time this might be a great time to do that\nAnd then start learning about alternative ways that you couldn't use your capital to generate safer and smarter returns without stock market risk because that's where you know\nWith the stock market where it is now with the volatility ever present and you know with the upside really kept unlimited based on what's going on in the environment than we probably need to start looking at some other ways to generate income going forward\nParticular as we head into the new year and as we start seeing you know the trade policy start kicking in it's going to have a real significant impact on our consumer based economy and if you look around\nThere's a lot of retail spaces that are empty now there's a lot of bacon shops that are have been available for a lot longer than they used to be\nAnd if if you were there back in two thousand eight two thousand nine if you were there and two thousand two thousand one you were there and Ninety to Ninety three right you saw the same sort of thing where all of a sudden this commercial real estate there was less appetite for it\nAnd that was the beginning of those are the canaries in the coal mine and so as the canaries in the coal mine are giving us a message we need to be able to listen to them and take action based on it and so what we're looking for the online training academy or people that see these canaries and want to do something about it\nAnd folks that are co trouble you know willing to learn a new way of thinking and and have a higher aspirations for their assets than the conventional approach [noise]\nWell we're looking for folks that you know believe that they can do better you know they've gotten to where they've gotten in life through hard work\nThrough their brain power and we want you to do is bring that hard work bring that brain power and apply it to your own financial assets so instead of making money for someone else we want you to use your hard work and use your assets to make money for you\nOkay and that's really the core being do yourself investor is taking a hard look at you know what have you been trained to do and most people have been trained to be an employee and most people have been trained to work for someone else and\nThat's certainly where I started and you know there's some benefits to working for someone else as far as responsibility and focus\nBut at the same time everyone should also have an aspect of their life of their financial life\nThat they have control over I think that's part of the allure of a lot of the personal finance ... personal finance approaches that you know you may work for someone else but here's some things you can do to manage your own money\nAnd my concern with most of it is it is like most of the personal finance advice assumes that you're in a static world assumes you only have one stream of income in assumes that you're not getting a raise in assumes that you know wherever you are as good\nThe world it assumes you only have one stream of income it assumes that you're not getting a raise it assumes that you know wherever you are as good as it gets and then you just have to hope and pray that nothing happens between now and the time you turn a hundred and maybe you'll have accumulated enough um that you will run out\nAnd to me the whole accumulation model is you know it works if you've got multiple millions of dollars but for most people it's not the best way for you to use your money and maybe maybe it is when you're busy maybe it is when you don't have time to focus on your money maybe it's important when you don't care enough about your money\nBut when you realize the power of your capital and realize that your capital can provide for you right now it starts supplement your income or replace your income or that your capital can generate income for the rest of your life then if you start appreciating the power of the capital\nThen you have to realize what you're doing following the personal finance monitors are really kind of selling your short\nAnd particularly if you're a smart person who's made their way with hard work isn't it worth it to learn about how do you take that intelligence how do you take being a smart person couple that with your hard work and apply in the financial markets\nAnd you know with that so we're looking for folks that are willing to learn a new way of thinking about their money there will be comfortable\nAnd significantly are motivated to make a change in our motivated to take control of their income and I recognize there's times in life where you're really busy right you're starting a new career you're starting a family\nBut there's also times in life where you can carve out a couple of hours a week\nOr a couple of hours a month and use that time more productively and if you could do that and do it in a way where you're building income for the future and build more important building you're hoping confidence that you'll be able to generate the income you need for the rest of your life\nThan that as a a good way for it to use your time energy and effort\nAnd if you're willing to learn that then we want to meet you\nAnd if you want to start getting the perspective of becoming a do yourself investor then give yourself a opportunity open yourself up\nTo learn about you know specifically how to start treating her capital with respect how to get out of harm's way and more importantly how you can start getting some returns that aren't based on the stock market you know the stock market\nIs a high risk adventure normally it's absolutely a high risk venture right now and you don't have to be there there are alternative places for you to generate income and do it so he can sleep at night and do it so in a safer smarter way than what everybody else is doing\nAnd you know and you gotta ask yourself if everybody else is doing it\nYou know why on earth are you doing it and if you're satisfied with ... below average returns keep doing what you're doing\nIf you want to learn about how to make them better than average returns than the oath to yourself to become a do yourself investor and to become an effective do yourself investor you need to get educated so

I'm the businesses in the back of your closet you warming nearly every day before your office went ... casual\nGet rejuvenated me and\nLearned a little bit about technical analysis and a ban after I came back I just immerse myself in that now the interesting thing about it for me was a bad um you know online training academy a version one point oh\nOr when I walked out of that class there was no online support uh never talk to my instructor again\nAnd ... basically a left there to do it myself a\nCompared to where we are today and all the online programs and all the online classes and all the support for the students get and the ability to come back to the class and now instead of having to go up and fly two thousand miles ah you know there are centers within driving distance of most major locations\nIn the country in your class this week you had a student from two thousand ten right and she'd gotten busy she built a business and now she had an opportunity so she came back to take advantage of her lifetime education\nI Know for me I I I went to apply to Texas to take my on my training academy class and I said well why do I bring that back here set of flying all over the playwright\nAnd uh so that that's how I was born and so from that\nMoment on um you know I immersed myself in it and I learned how to adapt to the new way of doing business and thank goodness but I did\nOr I or you know I see some of them by and this is no slam on any other vocation at all but I see a lot of people now around town in Chicago they used to stand in the pit and made thousands and thousands of dollars a month\nNow doing things that are are like selling insurance are working at Wal Mart or something right now and uh you know I I was able to survive and thrive in and the and I love it I still love trading and I still am enthusiastic getting out of the bed every morning and excited\nAnd we're seeing a lot of people are looking for that purpose and they've had successful businesses they had a career they're ready to make a transition\nAnd all of a sudden they need a place to comments a lot of those folks come to mind training academy\nYeah and that's the beauty of of this uh experience and the skill set because all it is is learning new skills I tell my students all the time I said yeah you may from thirty thousand feet of may look complicated and this and that it's really not\nAnd uh it's just a matter of learning the skill sets a I couldn't learn what they do for a living very quickly um\nAnd the good news it's you know there's nothing I'm teaching them that that none of them are they all have the capacity to learn there's nothing I deliver\nThat is you know over the top but as far as being able to absorb the simple math and uh just recognizing the opportunities they present themselves in the market to based on um a historical price\nWhat's so funny my twelve year old took the course when he was eleven and I said Thomas how was it and he said oh it was great\nAll I have to do is follow the steps but the funny thing was he was in there was a lot of fifty sixty Seventy year old and he said I can understand why they can't do it they just have to follow the closest that when he took it again this year and he was basically I can insistent assistant instructor with another twelve year old\nThat was helping everybody to just implement put into action\nAnd just take advantage of the opportunity yeah\nThink you know the young kids get it\nAnd easier uh\nNot just the the software challenges a of which are so great but again it's learning new systems I couldn't go into any business and learn you know the system is very easily but um it's also that\nPeople of of uh\nAre even though the ban stage of age thirty on on up they've been placed in their whole life they've been taught all the wrong things from Wall street they the\nWall Street somehow managed to convince people they should do things counter to what they do for themselves\nA as consumers in other words they they talk about buying things when they're going up in price and be fearful of buying when they go down now what business could possibly make money doing that and so the people he telling it [noise] yeah exactly and so I you know people believe that uh they need to know a lot about a particular company and the ...\nAnd they're doing that and so the people he valiant [noise] yeah exactly and so you know people believe that uh they need to know a lot about a particular company had to buy things when they're going up a that's not what we teach\nAnd let's go back and we just have a minute or so votes go back to them when I first met in two thousand seven the market was getting to all time highs at the time and that was the beginning of a pullback so what do you see similar today that you saw from two thousands\nHard seeing a number of these things are over the years and then two thousand dollars out on a new recall some time\nUh information was out there you know I'm On the market is interesting because it doesn't pay attention to certain things until it's done and you know it wasn't until embarrassed turns in Lehman Brothers went a little out of that all of a sudden a everything went into freefall\nAnd and so we know ... something like this is only going to happen again we we'd be out there would be very wrong here and I'm I'm you're you're a bull market are episode so at some point we're going to backtrack\nNo one can predict when but it will happen and I think that was interesting I had a call last night from students dozens of\n'em I hadn't Tom and Tom I Am seeing for over a year year and the last thing they said to me it was talking about going on the mastermind community which is our highest level of education dish I mean suddenly tell you the most important thing\nI'm pulling out of this education is not necessarily how to take advantage of his moves up and down the risk management skills who said that's worth its weight in gold it's worth every penny of bad for the education of fire and I couldn't agree with them more because of you know\nWe know to be an effective do yourself investor you need to get educated so called

valuable advice about the importance of remaking yourself\nRecognizing when changes upon us\nAnd right now in the market you know change is upon us and we can do nothing and see what happens and we we've seen that happen before and the results weren't so good\nOr we can learn how to evaluate opportunities and be able to shift our focus to take advantage of the opportunities presented to us you know the market\nIs always moving and as a do it yourself and best or you know you can allow allow yourself to ride the roller coaster or more importantly you can get yourself out of harm's way and

neuropathy a neurologist didn't give Marc many answers and he said well you can take some vitamins we can prescribe pain killer I said but I don't have any pain and he said well there's really not much else you can do I call to set up in a point\nAnd he said well you can take some vitamins we can prescribe pain killer I said but I don't have any pain and he said well there's really not much else you can do I call the set up an appointment with Virginia family chiropractic because they were the only treatment I could find that didn't involve taking drugs or pain killers or things like

amazing if\nYou experience numbness shooting pains or loss of balance call to learn if you're a candidate for a drug free and non surgical treatment Virginia family chiropractic five seven one three five zero thirty five twenty or Virginia family chiropractic dot com\nQuite a quite a situation there and meanwhile it's amazing because President Trump is also carrying on with them in terms with the caravan election and he's currently appearing between four and five or rallies a week and this week alone he had three rallies and three days in three different state so ah\nWe've got quite the situation here but\nI did speak with a gentleman named Steve Cortez he is the president of the Trump Hispanic advisory council and this is what he had to say about the whole situation he said Americans are compassionate people and we emphasize with all those who suffer and respect the desires\nOf millions to become Americans tolerating illegality is not real compassion not for our own American citizens and not for illegal immigrants who are often abused\nBy the inherent criminality of course borders\nHe said walls work the examples or many globally but the best model is Israel or a serious high tech border barricade on its southern border with Egypt Gaza\nCut illegal crossings by Ninety nine percent over five years so that's kind of a wide swath out there about what's going on because the caravan a is certainly a changeable situation\nWill we've gone from ... to ... when it comes to the huge divide between Democrats and Republicans and sort of what topic is front and center to divide the country\n[noise] yeah well that's definitely it and you know we had the caravan of the media and now we have a caravan of polls as well I mean certainly the pollsters are busy talking about how Americans feel about immigration and certainly a it there is a huge for us and divide and uh well let's just look at a couple of uh\nUh of the same as a ... a lot of these are nonpartisan polls as well and the cars are over a bill that immigration is the most important issue\nFor a Republican voters\nAnd I mean that's what they're looking at and certainly Trump was very much aware of this and a at a Gallup poll also found that said immigration has risen to the top of the list when Americans are asked to name the most important problem facing the nation edges out to have problems with the government\nAh which certainly glad the back there for quite awhile Gallup says and ah it also says the twenty two percent of Americans who say immigration is the problem\nIs up from fourteen percent and and just a month so this is something that's really a bearing on everyone's minds they really don't know what to think about it but he thinks strong odds and certainly have the research center poll of over ten thousand Americans Rick\nUh which was released earlier this week shows how starling the divide is a fifty seven percent of Democrats said that the way immigrants in this country illegally are treated as a very big problem and only Fifteen Percent of Republicans agree with that\nDue to the political parties obviously trying to energize their base and the various groups and organizations with in their voting base\nFor the Republicans is ... and it is the evangelicals who are very active and organized and of course the march for life is is really big deal in Washington\nYeah indeed and this was a big ... a week for the march for life and you will on the forty six annual march for life is in January and that's coming up pretty quick and all this week the organizers have revealed what they're saying is and it's a fascinating thing\nUh they're twenty nineteenth theme is this unique from day one pro life is pro science\nI think about that ah there's a huge science community out there as well but this is what their reasoning is I think it's pretty interesting uh they say science is behind the pro life movement\nWe saved a medical a technological advances oh is that from the pro life movement for example DNA is present at fertilization that no fingerprint on earth past present and future is the same we know too that a baby heart you suggest six weeks and they uh they did go on to just\nSpeak about this but anyway it's an interesting idea and uh you have to remember that as a pro life or\nThe march for life is a huge event I mean sometimes it draws as much as six hundred and fifty thousand people and it certainly does not drawing much media coverage and this year the march itself is on January teeth\nAnd they're very organized and their organization is uh\nAnd it certainly does not drawn much media coverage and this year the march itself is on January team\nThey're very organized and their organization is underway and next next year Ben Shapiro was among the folks were going to be speaking at the march and he's editor in chief of daily wire and it was certainly President Trump vice president Mike Pence lots of Republican lawmakers have always supported them but you mentioned evangelicals and this has also been a very\nA very active week for them because\nThey are organizing for the mid term elections and let's talk about the family Research Council very briefly they have launched a prey vote and stand campaign effort and this was asking the faith minded to make it personal vow to vote this year and here's what the vows says\nFor the sake of America I pledge to pray to vote and to stand for my biblical values and I'm coming up on November fourth I was just forty eight hours before the polls open there's going to be a very large are kind of a jumbo event uh featuring I'm\nTony Perkins he's the president of the family Research Council along with Mike Huckabee will be there evangelical as I'm even jealous I'm\nAndrew ... and I'm just a constitutional lawyer Michael terrorists and they expect a very big crowd this was in an arena type of event and they've also put out a a voter guide and it's this voter guide includes a tutorial for people on how the prey effectively for the president and other elected officials\nAnd some very religious organizations have sign on to this effort including the American Family Association\nAre concerned women for America and others so it's fascinating to see a ... how\nOrganized the evangelicals are and also how they really do reach out to the faith minded folks and if you're wondering about how large a voting bloc the evangelicals are ah it depends on what\nDemographics you're looking at because they can vary but it goes as a minimum of about thirty million people all the way up to Ninety million so uh interesting\nA week for the pro life folks and evangelicals as well\nMake America great again of course an anthem for President Trump and his followers but there was a movement to make one film screwed again\n[laughter] yeah well we could certainly use it right now this is a new movement called make comedy great again and this is a brand new up project and part of the organizers behind this is the art TV and a lot of folks\nWill know that this is the video subscription a network which was founded by mark within and uh this is the make comedy great again tore it is getting underway this weekend as a ... city tour of some very notable Venus with five comedians\nAnd this is what they have to say do you remember what great comedy was it was smart it was well performed it made you laugh until you cried it was a political it wasn't profane and I wasn't worried about her feelings and after being away for far too long great comedy is back that is what they are saying they want a\nA people to appreciate the conservative language was feeling feeling free to laugh liberal way you're going to find them at make comedy great again dot com and also the folks over the air TV they present their gas and Marie he says while mainstream media Hollywood and big ticket league\nIgnore heartland Americans see our TV will continue to promote and provide content and options to this underserved audience so we'll see what happens with make comedy great again 'cause we sure could use a laugh right now so\nHere's one you wrote about and I I'm not sure I Want to go there but it's encouraging to people for the ethical treatment of animals joins the bandwagon of those after justice Kevin Oh\nYes indeed well ah there's that was kind of quick but this happened but certainly a justice Kevin has drawn the attention of the people for ethical treatment of animals and they notice that I'm Mr Kavanaugh is required to serve on the court's cafeteria committee\nAnd yes there is a cafeteria at the Supreme Court I Try to find out what what was on the menu and the only thing they revealed was that it had a variety of hot entree sandwiches suits salads back some beverages\nAnd that's according to the court sewn guide but\nAh the president of key to that is a lady named Ingrid knew her she has written a letter to justice cabinet off\nAnd here's what it says this may not strike you as the most important decision that you could make but it would have a positive impact on both animals and human health and your position on the course cafeteria committee you could make a sound judgment on the merits of pro life eating\nUp by offering predominantly vegan food selections on the cafeteria menu and perhaps even come up with an added incentive for justices to choose plant based options that's within your jurisdiction we would\nEven come up with an added incentive for justices to choose plant based option\nThat's

com Mad Max dot com\n... seven twenty six Saturday morning update I'm Rick seller Hillary Clinton will just not go away [noise]\nThis was earlier in the week\nHillary talking about Bill Clinton [noise]\n\n\nThat will have that audio for you in effect on the purpose of the conversation is there is two opposing schools of thought on whether she will run again in twenty twenty\nIn retrospect do you think [noise]\nStill should've resigned in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky is absolutely not it wasn't an abuse of power now while there are people who look at the end to the Ninety and they say a president of the United states cannot have a consensual relationship with him in charge of the power imbalance in adult\nBut let me ask you that [noise] where's the investigation if the current incumbent against him numerous allegations have been made\nDid you catch that she was an adult silver just throws it right on Monica kind of gave bill up past there didn't she well anyway the point being fill the brain has she may have seen him on some of the cable news channels on\nKind of gave bill passed there didn't she well anyway the point being fill the brain as you may have seen him on some of the cable news channels on Fox CNN all over the place worked for Hillary all the way back to two thousand two and he made the argument not only on TV this week but to Politico that\nHillary Clinton might actually be the Democratic party's best hope for defeating Trump in twenty twenty\nHe says no other Democrat has quote anywhere near a base of thirty two million people especially not senators Bernie Sanders or Elizabeth Warren he feels the party shouldn't dismiss her as a failed candidate because quote she's smarter and tougher than most\nThen she could raise money easier than most All right that's the opinion of a former Clinton staffer\nTurned the page to the New York times a member of the new a New York times editorial board has a message for quote broadly unpopular Hillary Clinton as the midterms loom\nWill it seems as though the prince\nNBS is a kind of pending it on these Fifteen guys as though it was a rogue effort and they you know they they sacked one of the the high level security guys but uh you know it does somebody probably had some direction given maybe\n[noise] yeah I look I I think they're being sacked are clearly but it's not because they killed the man is because they embarrass the prince uh again I don't leave for a minute that this would have been done especially what this level of effort I mean apparently people were flown in\nBy this event and flown back out I mean the Saudi Government is very much\nRuled by a family in that family is very much in control that you you don't have things happening randomly\nSo I think you're going to hear the best possible face it put put on this by the Saudis and they're going to say it was\nSome random act of violence by a bunch of people who are out of control but the truth is going to be this is a huge embarrassment to them and frankly we have to look at turkey a little bit here too I I'm not convinced that turkey while they're not friends with the Saudi Arabians for some reason\nUh there was some belief that the Saudis can do this with impunity on character soil so there's something there to be looked at it as well\nWell it's kind of weird because the story is that his fiance actually dropped him off and I would imagine should probably gonna wait around for at least she knew where he was and then he disappears I mean ... obviously\nPeople are going to say well he went in and he never came out I mean it's not as though you did it somewhat anonymously and maybe he was poisoned somewhere or there was a hit on the street that could be made to look like some street crime or something and it's like kind of the ... not really good strategy on if you're trying to cover this up\nYeah no I think there was there was a belief that there was a ... an objective here to make the guy go missing and not have any record and he kind of disappears but obviously there may or may not be an audio record of what happened and I I've heard there's something I've not heard anything or seen anything\nSo it's it is kind of a mystery but with that said like I said there is there something not we don't know or we don't understand yet about the whole Kurt Angle and uh and I think we'll we'll probably hear more on that develop over the next few weeks\nSo what does it mean for U.S policy obviously the president wants to continue with the arms sales to Saudi Arabia or but he's getting a lot of political pressure of what is the security and and national security aspects for us in addition to not only the potential effect on gas prices\nYeah well you know we right now are doing it about three dollars a gallon nationwide we're coming a net exporter which is all good I don't know it obviously opaque does something as a whole we would be\nA ... you know hurt by it Saudi Arabia has been more or less willing to deal with us on this so this is an issue that we have to deal with that is true\nBut I I Would argue they're not the most important element of our Middle East strategies are there are other nations out there which more than willing to actually kind of step up and be stronger allies and obviously one of the things you and I've spoken about a lot\nIs this Middle East strategic alliance or or an Arab NATO if you will Middle East NATO and the you know they were supposed to play a key role\nPresident Trump announced his concept for this so two years ago there with that said uh look are there other nations out there who will be more than willing to pick that up and move out with us and Saudi Arabians have had their own problems regarding yet they've been doing things which are created a what some are going to be war\nRegarding hitting civilian target so I think we have to be very cautious as we go forward with the Saudis and try to assess what's in the interest of both countries and and boy there's daylight and frankly\nI think we have to be very cautious as we go forward with the Saudis and try to assess what's in the interest of both countries where there's daylight and frankly I don't think we can stand for a rental is being an outright murders\nOr a no matter who you know who he is or what he's doing it in such a bold a blatant way\nImages throughout the week of the caravan of Central Americans moving north through Guatemala\nBreaking through a border into Mexico many of them are held up on a bridge as of this morning I'm estimates over four thousand in that migrant caravan and what is it that is not being reported in the major national news outlets as an example\nTo traffickers and and financing behind this and number one who are the traffickers and and the just the extent of the criminal activity in the trafficking alone\nThe trafficking is something that goes on and and look ah we we have all sorts of things the traffic is we're talking about major sources of drugs\nMajor sources of all sort of a loaf of goods and frankly you know the the people business people moving business seem very good so\nWhat we're saying here right because it's actually a that on ... and I think one of the things that the American media is not looking as who's paying for this because you know money's got to be spent to move these people there's videos of of men handing money out to the people in these caravans and who is why is this happening\nUh as far as I'm concerned this is a military issue and if you have four thousand people who are not invited not wanted come into your border I you know even if they're not armed that's an invasion\nAnd I'm One of those who believes President Trump should take a very strong stand if he has to put the national guard shoulder to shoulder along the border to stop this sounds like a Mexican you're trying to actually help us a little bit right now\nBut it doesn't change the fact that this is an orchestrated effort there are elements behind this is trying to make this happened\nAnd I think simply what they tried to overwhelm our border security purposes of essential trying to create a you know open border and has no one's interest because those are the people bringing stuff up a would also open up the terrorists in other words you know the usual watcher of the apple ... recording about\nTerrorist organizations having safe houses along the border so this is this is a very serious issue\nNow a story that is not getting much play outside of the hill or the Fox news channel is the latest on the testimony by some of the key members at the FBI and ... or the wife of Bruce or at the FBI and this whole question of the Steele dossier\nAnd the you know\nI guess some are calling spying on the Trump Administration and the spying during the campaign on the Trump campaign what are the latest developments this week as Nelly or did testify behind closed doors on friday\nSo I started out with the very thing you just said that I see a as someone asked uh one of 'em\nThe attorney for um for Glenn Simpson what exactly has been confirmed the CIA and Simpson turning couldn't name one thing so I think if you start out with that as the beginning and there's clearly a lot that's been put into\nAnd wait regarding the dossier which turns out that no one can verify darn thing in it\nBut that ... has resulted in essentially what I Would call a a game of Thrones\nAre going on behind the scenes where you have people throwing each other under the bus or ... and ... and her husband are now a key to walk a I'm being told is probably going to be\nA perjury or a U.S charges against going Simpson of GPS and this is no small issue but there are a number of folks ah I miss it you know most of the documentation you're talking about is boxing the hill but it is documentation of the hill has been very good about showing who's been testify one they've been testifying\nAnd let me tell you wreck what I'm hearing is that these people now that kind of the damage busted they're all kind of trying to throw each other under the bus or the best condition so a boy you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a lawyer trying to have someone that boy jail right now regarding this whole issue there in Washington so it's a it's going to get more interesting as things go\nWell stated hey we've got about a minute left or you're involved in elections security with the midterms coming up you've been traveling this week what are the key issues what are you looking at\nIs up in Pennsylvania with the both houses of the legislature on Tuesday look we're looking for security\nA basic security regarding paper ballots as the big thing that I'm that my
