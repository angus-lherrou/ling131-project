understand I'm afraid of being returned so that's why that's why I Need to say here oh okay that's suddenly is that that's a reason I fear violence\nWe've had this discussion I don't understand and I'm sure the ... this is this is the thinking that's going on inside the Trump Administration has like a lot of people in Baltimore who were afraid to walk to the bus stop\nBecause of the gang violence in their neighborhoods there are people in Chicago were afraid to sit on the front porch because of gang violence\n... where do we send them\nSo the ... the question that I have now is what do we do about it like\nWell how do we stop the so the president had instituted a policy of one hundred percent prosecution at the border to the effect of that being the separation of families of the adults were prosecuted\nThat puffy ended\nBecause of both public pressure and the court's going after the president and saying you can't do this and throwing ... him the effect of that policy coming to a conclusion forced to say we are open for business\nTo get illegal immigrants to rush the boring to come across into the country and up to the point that we have record numbers of family members coming across from Central America now in September and it's not over\nAs yet another wave of migrants attempts to make their way illegally into the United states roughly four thousand Honduran migrants right now are in Guatemala they're headed north they met caravan has grown to about four thousand people so far four thousand yes heading this way\nNow secretary of state Mike Pompeo is going to Mexico tomorrow\nIs going to be missed going there is going to meet with his counterparts up tomorrow and the conversation is going to include this caravan moving north [noise]\nIt looks like right now we're getting some help from the Mexicans on this question the Mexican government has sent to seven twenty seven Boeing planes failed to the brim with federal police officers to their own southern border with Guatemala\nOr this week yesterday to intercept Central Americans who attempt to reach the U.S border\nThe Mexicans appearing to be doing that although I'm it appears they will process people who are seeking some sort of refugee status and maybe even keep them in the country so the end result is not yet not necessarily that they're turning everybody away\nWell here's the thing Mexico does Amman because as you said they can they can seek 'em and they got ... status asylum in Mexico which doesn't mean they get to the United states\nBut it means they get they get they get on the land and they start moving north\nWell absolutely and and but Mexico does require that you have a passport\nTo get to cross over into Mexico Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua you only have to have your national identity card so so what effect it used to be like well you could go to Canada or Mexico with just a driver's license we used to be able to do that\nThat was the same thing now it's still the same thing in Guatemala Honduras El Salvador Nicaragua so that's why they made it so easily from Honduras in Guatemala they just cross the border hairs you know hey here's my national identity card that everybody gets\nThat doesn't work in Mexico you need some sort of documenting any documentation so and Mexico doesn't want these people to 'cause they can't handle four thousand people all claiming refugee status looking for asylum they they can handle that\nSo um so they don't want him either and the president of Guatemala is urging people I'm saying that they don't want you know don't join this group because President Trump told them flat out you don't stop this we will immediately sees all funding to your\nCountry a threat no he's threatening to to yank a U.S is the U.S is aid\nTo countries like Honduras yes ethically\nIf they don't get the caravan stopped um but again the Caribbean is gone they're not even under us anymore they're in Guatemala so uh now it's become

coming to Social Security in the new year not just for people who are collecting\nGood morning\nGrey tabby here I big changes coming to Social Security in the new year not just for people who are collecting currently or plan to and as soon but also people who are paying into it to me it seems like there's good news and bad news so why don't you give us the good news first\nNew Social Security they're going to see an increase for the ... hippie in about two point six percent on that we've seen inflation start to pick up here in the United states whenever you look at more economic growth and job creation and wages going up and that means a little bit more of an increase in their pay\nOkay gotcha so so more so people will see bigger checks are and this is this is not a normal annual increases has a bigger one then we normally see right\nThat's the largest one we've seen in a number of years you know\nA couple of years there I'm going to bother ministry and there was no increase it all in fact there were areas the least measured by the consumer price index there with deportation and so there's deflation many ... you're going down there is no change in the level of Social Security and so in increases last year when they look at prices overall that increased security benefits as well now\nBut yeah but you only got this gig a hundred and forty four years ago and it was a developing country\nYes things have changed a lot quite a bit and on the backs of the United states and that's why the president saying well wait a second our economy's being exploited for China's growth and they're paying like nothing to ship stuff to the United states while people in the U.S can't even get the same deal\nAnd yet when you want to ship a package it to a soldier who's overseas it's twenty dollars depending on the side of the package it's you know it's it's a rounded meal Eighteen twenty dollars because you have to pay the postage families that want to ship goods to their loved ones who are serving have to pay they get free they don't get reduced rate right you have to pay full fare\nAnd costs money real money Chinese companies now make up sixty percent of all packages shift into the United states sixty percent sixty percent\nSo of course this is something that needs to be fixed apparently Peter Navarro the president's trade advisor we've talked to him a bunch of times right here on MORNING on the mall was a big advocate for this it was at his urging a that this change\nUm they've of course they've had problems with the world Trade Organization they've been going after a bunch of these things NAFTA naturally I mean the president really are upset with what he sees as unfair trade practices how do you come across how do you tell me that this is anything but unfair\nThis ... this idea that China can ship a package of four and a half hour packet five bucks to New York and in LA it costs sixteen dollars\n... but see but here's the thing if I'm if I'm In LA and I'm shipping to New York I'm paying U.S Postal service if I'm In China shipping to New York that's not the u._s. postal certainly that gets to the U.S needs to be handled by okay then it has to have somebody gets here than it has to be distributed in it they they pay the lower rate\nSo gotcha okay so they're paying this guy and um that makes sense yeah that's not fair to Iowa indication the New York times says whether China will retaliate for pulling out of the treaty okay ... maybe they will will say that again well we don't\nSpend as much to China we don't we don't tattered as much of China because of the trade deficit so it certainly not going to hurt us as much if they choose to do that\nAnd then um they it says you're the times says that the president does not according to administration officials the president does not need congressional approval to withdraw from this particular ... because the last version of it never put up for a vote\nSo he's good he's in the clear he can just yank you can get out of this treaty and start charging equitable prices to the Chinese\nDescent packages into the United states so what what what's the end result that this will American consumers into paying a little bit more if they want to buy products from China yes as of course the answer to that if the products that come to American companies that are part of the the actual process you know the the\nAssembly line yeah it's going to cost a little bit more but are we going to get to a place where it's fair and we're not being exploited by Chinese workers you can actually send things much cheaper to the United states that Americans can that'll fix that\nIs also going to help small retailer small businesses who you know have their have their products knocked off by the Chinese much because they don't they don't ... you know regard Patton and then they can sell them for much cheaper because they're not paying the shipping bingo bang go\nBill I'm done I'm going home

I'm kind of push people so so your choices then you walk on either side of it and you wind up walking in the street and and they're really annoying but I get why they had them\nBut you'll see that you start to see them more and more in New York now on the sidewalks to prevent people from driving a into buildings and to prevent them now from driving\nDown ... there's a serious loss in here that goes beyond ... like think about it if you would do it for your family or if you would do it for your coworkers then maybe it's appropriate for your country well no because we need more voters in terms of coming yeah seven twenty nine and WMA now\nAnd that person was involved and also leaking this information to reporters\nI mean this is this is terrible for a number of reasons obviously to have a government officials doing this\nBut what he does is this is not you know just some like low level people these are senior officials rifles live actually like long careers in this business who are working for literally the financial crimes enforcement network at the Treasury Department in other words they are their job is law enforcement it's keeping our laws and instead\nThey're being corrupt and they're hurting people and they're leaking information specifically to hurt people because of their politics and they're destroying American confidence in the federal government's ability to conduct its job any just manner I mean I imagine for yuan does a former government official\n... this month shaken to make you must in Syria you to see your government a government's reputation so tattered by people like this\nOh it does and unfortunately it's another example of what everybody keeps referring to it as the swap you know this gigantic civil service bureaucracy that we all used to think was very\nVery non partisan a A N and we now see they are and and that they are willing to abuse the great power they have of course the other thing that that they should bring up to people is the fact of\nOf um look these suspicious activity reports that that that banks have to file with the Treasury Department is is that this is under the U.S bank secrecy active Nineteen Seventy [noise]\nUm we really need to really look at that law because um it's a real invasion of people's privacy look if if you or I decide\nThat I'm you know we want to buy a new car and and maybe I'm a we don't want to have a bank loan and pay interest if you go down to your bank\nAnd you take Fifteen thousand dollars out of your savings account if you're lucky enough to have that much you know what's gonna happen the bank is going to file a suspicious activity report on you with the U.S Treasury Department why because you took cash out of your bank account more than ten thousand dollars\nYeah that is a tremendous invasion of\nPrivacy and this has been abused on numerous occasions in the past particularly others there's a case I'm just a couple of years ago in Maryland dairy farmer they sell their products at at farmers' markets they were constantly depositing um the cash they got it was just under ten thousand dollars\nThe IRS came in sees sixty three thousand dollars from this dairy farmer because they said oh you were trans acting you you were a structuring of transactions to avoid\nThat ten thousand dollar suspicious activity report it wasn't true\nAnd how would they ever get how how how would they know that if it wasn't reporting to the government\n... exactly right but this is a tremendous invasion of people's privacy and I think\nWell in other words to say why why are we doing that the government in other words the\nIn that case the IRS was lying I mean the government new information that they weren't even supposed to get reports on this is really scary actually when you describe it I'm I'm a ... even know what's happening that's my money how about you keep your grumpy hands on that you're not entitled to it\nYeah it ... that actually right by ... heat here you know it's not\nJust the uh we have this one problem of the government seizing funds from people who are doing things that are perfectly legal but all the other hand here we have all this very private information in the hands of bureaucrats who felt no compunction about leaking it\nAnd very quickly even renting at a time of the superior the unnamed sit here\nInformation in the hands of bureaucrats who felt no compunction about leaking it\nOff and and very quickly we're running out of time but the superior the unnamed superior and also the reporter who was apparently requested some of this information are we going to see any kind of a rest with those two\nWell that's why I said that was very intriguing hum this person was the other the other co conspirator inside of the Treasury Department I Wonder whether they the government got it agreement from that person to help them\nUm uh find out information about this and I wonder is there anybody else involved but they're also going to go after\nWell it's good to see some arrests being made and some justice being done because Americans have wanted to see this for a long time and even though it's slow and yeah the bottom level

long as it costs more than thirty five dollars per month\n[noise] and what what is the point of this what is the hopes of the administration by doing this well\nI think what we hope to do here is to make sure that people know what they're paying for that I Know what their [noise]\nAnd that's what we what we want to do to make sure that poor people take a drug that they know what the prices are too many times people the price of a drug\nCourt percentage of the list price or their co insurance\nAnd so we want to make sure that that is absolutely clear to the consumers and providers [laughter]\nThey all have a clear what the actual prices of this drug so we hope that this is going to be an item of transparency for everyone and make it clear I also think it's a parallel to other important things for example cars\nThe sticker price is required that sixty years that cars have been required the sticker price\nAnd you go to a gas station you know what you're paying for that before you get in there and in this case we have coke and it's even more court which is people to help cure the drugs but there again for their wives and we want to make sure\nI that's a great point I

working like sewage and stuff they don't like them at all they're like just stop using just use regular debatable toilet paper\nBut the pleasurable white they've gotten worse like you're trying to

like you know just as she has she done anything with it he's like well yeah she had mastered career\nYou know she shouldn't be in the Indian Museum that best that's the basic reaction people gave so then Benny basically assuming of course why would they have an exhibit to Elizabeth Warren inside the national museum of the American Indian so he decides you know what to do is just walk around in the kind of look at the museum and then I'm going to get out of there and head back to the Daily Caller\nWell sure enough listen to what he discovers as he's walking around inside the museum he's this is complete with Benny whispering into the microphone as he kind of observes each exhibit listen\nHere inside the Pocahontas exhibit\nAt the national museum of the American Indian [noise]\nYou would absolutely not believe\nOkay so I feel like you're not just you know he didn't see like you know Pocahontas statue or a picture of Pocahontas because lives with one Elizabeth Warren's photo is in the Pocahontas exhibit\nAt the national museum of the American Indian\nLike for real her photo it's been has been placed in the exhibit\nIs there a fund does a photo have like a black bar over her eyes as you know like when you when you see the fashion magazines they fashioned dues and fashion don't have the don't first they were sort of like a black or over the person's eyes she liked the bad example\nNo she she's there and all of her warranty glory she's their answer is I think it's her official photo\nAnd it wasn't again this is not like something that somebody left behind as a joke nobody went in there and was trolling the music that would be a great joke do why didn't we think that was well we're we're you know we can keep it in the past ... working on that but but but here's the reality\nThere is a digital screen glowing in the corner of the Pocahontas exhibit and on it is a picture of President Trump and separately a photo of Elizabeth Warren\nAnd what it it's one of these things the Smithsonian trying to basically offer like a modern touch they want to bring some relevant contemporary news item into the exhibit apparently because on it it says it had the date June twenty fifth two thousand Seventeen and this is apparently when President Trump said listen this is the exhibit described why they have Elizabeth Warren's photo their\nPresident Donald Trump says that when that when he called Senator Elizabeth Warren Pocahontas he's not insulting her is warns claim of Indian ancestry says Trump that as an insult to the renowned Native American woman a few months before the president had taunted Democrats saying Pocahontas is now the face of your party\nSo Elizabeth Warren is legitimately or small photo of her is legitimate and we ended up Pocahontas exhibit at the national museum of the American Indian in fact Mary I think what we can say is\nWell less than one percent of the national museum of the American Indian is devoted to Elizabeth Warren one\nOne thousand twenty fourth maybe\nThey hit the perfect balance to scale I cannot believe we didn't think that putting something in the museum about Elizabeth Warren smuggling they were way ahead of the journal I didn't get that answer they were way ahead of this amazing that's all that's a good job at eight eight forty three uh WMA\nDC area how would you like the chance to earn cash every
