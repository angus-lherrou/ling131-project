issue for Brett Kavanaugh ... just and and as I go through this listen to the intensity of this can you if you believe something like this would happen\nAt undergraduate student at Yale\nBrett Kavanaugh was involved in an altercation at a local bar during which he was accused of throwing ice on another patron according to a police report\nHe threw ISIS somewhat allegedly she allegedly through ice oh well they clearly he is not fit for a lifetime appointment\nThings were different in Nineteen eighty five Mary so you don't understand people were allowed to throw ice back then things aren't really changed you can always be in the incident which occurred in ... this is a real story Mary stop laughing this is really in the New York times all the news that fits a print we\nWould there would there liquor in the in the glass with the ice or did he just throw a handful of eyes I Need the detail\nWell that's one of those gets interesting because the original accusation I Swear to you\nInvolved him supposedly throwing a beer which really made me wonder how does that work you you can't put ice in a beer that's insane that's ... true you know I used to be right down by putting

the island the president has been far from political advisors and hangers on and has spent time collectively went to high school friends who have come to be known collectively if inaccurately as the June gang\nSo you know he got together you know like so many other young islanders in the Nineteen seventies smoke pot the humor that long ago nickname now mainly they just golf and trash talk like in the old days mhm [noise]\nYeah well wax poetic about President Obama's use of illicit drugs in the seventies in high school and college but yet and Brett Kavanaugh I should be a you know didn't to be ruined because he allegedly through ice in college\nWell didn't didn't Obama at one point I think he'd I saw this popping around the last twenty four forty eight hours that Obama lamented at one point that if social media existed to the extent it does now\nDuring his first run for office in two thousand eight\nThat he would have been felt by it because people would've scrutinized his time in high school and would have made a big deal out of it\nI just don't I mean look what's happening is a picture isn't there a picture of him\nWill join holding it I'm like you know and I also got a hat on it's hard to distinguish the photo shops in the real stuff but we do know that he definitely we ... we don't know that he definitely was smoking weed I mean and he and he said as much the same gang is the whole is the whole deal it's like hot boxing in a car with his friends okay\nThat's what happens\nBut he was held to a wildly different standard as you're saying Mary\nAnd yet here's Brett

S. L. to be investigated so everyone's asking well and I've said this to where's the video where's the video put bring the video forward because the Democrats are investigating themselves\nBring the video forward All right Karen Monaghan tweets out\nYou are not entitled to my pain and trauma you're not entitled to see me getting dragged when my body is being exposed in more ways than one this is my trauma I dealt with the abuse I have already shared it more than I was originally comfortable comfortable with hash tag why I didn't report [noise]\nSo she brings is that now because the investigation has allegedly entity legit investigation into the alleged abuse has allegedly come to an end\nThey're saying oh we investigated this and they find that the abuse claims are unsubstantiated\nWill her video would substantiate the claim but you heard what she says there you my pain is personal I'm I don't want to be a because listen she knows if she turns this over to the D. S. L. which is a Democrat Party it's going to be leaked to the media\nThe video of her being dragged off the bed and apparently I guess it's embarrassing for her shows things she doesn't want shown is going to be at least in the media I mean do does anybody not believe that of course it is of course they're going to lead to the media I I Can't blame her of that but\nAt the same time that you know give it to the Republicans or give it to the FBI or somewhere where something along those lines someone you trust to verify to see it I\nYou know hold on to it but let them see it\nI don't have a problem with that let them see it hold on to it and that's not lead to the media\nAll right so I mean there are a couple of things at work here one is the standard by which I Want us all to live\nAnd the standard by which the Democratic party lives so the standard by which I Want to all the live is if an accuser brings allegation they should do everything within their power and their comfort level hopefully not to to um proven\nTo substantiate it for her she says there's a video that exist that's like clear evidence that it would have just for effort right to prove something happened so how do you handle that\nMaybe the way to do that is to bring in her doctor and they have a doctor you the video on his own or her own\nAnd signed a sworn affidavit describing the scene in the video maybe that's the beginning of the comfort level at which you would find that acceptable because she already told the doctor about her abuse named Keith Ellison and that named Keith Ellison and the fear of reprisal was listed by the doctor in late twenties Seventeen remember that the medical report\nSo that could be a way to approach this now that's the that's the universal standard stuff let's move to the Democratic party said\nBelieve all women how dare you question her she says this happened you can't question them\nAnd if you do you are a rape apologist you are a physical abuse apologist you were making space\nFor the exact toxic masculinity that's destroying our society how dare you get out of her way she gets to make this claim what upside does she have to make a claim like this she's losing everything by making a claim like this there is no possible upside for her\nThe only reason she would do this is because it's the truth now it's her truth\nShe gets to express her truth\nHere uh and so the Democratic party to dismiss her and just say hey look this this isn't a real thing this is not something that can be substantiated so therefore we do not hold Keith Ellison accountable boy that's a wandering standard because the the exact opposite has perpetrated on Brett Kavanaugh\nWho works for them or they did they have though according to can Martin who is the chair of the DFL they say the investigation report was unable to substantiate the claim of physical abuse they buy miss Monaghan but for the purpose of objectivity and getting all the facts regarding these allegations we've decided to forward the information in the investigation to local authorities\nIn order to let them review the contest and determine whether\nFurther investigation is warranted we wash our hands of the key is there you go [noise]\nUh the report was produced by ... us Susan ... sad [noise]\nUh who is uh the Minneapolis attorney who the DFL hired to conduct the investigation you're going to love this according to the piece she wrote\nAn allegation Standing Alone is not necessarily sufficient to conclude that conduct occurred particularly where the accusing party declines to produce supporting evidence that she herself asserts exists\nAllegation Standing Alone is not necessary\nParticularly where the accusing party declines to produce supporting evidence that she herself asserts
