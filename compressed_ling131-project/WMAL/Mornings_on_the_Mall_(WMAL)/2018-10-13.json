M. A. L.\nToday's show is provided for entertainment and general information purposes opinions expressed are those are the presenter Ollie we make no promises are guarantees of investment performance online training academy is not a broker dealer certified financial planner or register investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nTo the zoo yourself investors show this is Chris ... enjoying the do's and don'ts of the financial markets sex or a sponsor laundry academy and it was kind of make the show possible [noise] online\nTraining academy has been helping individuals like you become do it yourself investors since Nineteen Ninety seven online training Academy of two campuses to serve our listening audience one\nAt Tyson's corner and one near BWI Airport\nAnd one of the things we talk about on this show a lot is starting to make businesslike decisions with your money and\nLooking at yourself like a business and so one of the things you wanna get into today is really expanding out on how we help our students start ... looking at themselves like a business and then start making more systematic more consistent decisions to generate more consistent income for the rest of their lives\nAnd so you know one of the programs that we have that really helps her students that are most serious called the mastermind community and the mastermind community has a number of different services related to it one is a daily market overview for people that are actively trading in the markets there's also a\nOver hundreds of opportunities in what we call the supply and demand grid for over thirty five different assets\nEvery day there are opportunities identified in the stock market identified the futures market identified in the forest market identified an options for people that are able to implement income strategies and the various markets\nThere's also a a an opportunity to interact with students from all around the world as well as our instructors and orange truckers are all professional traders and they give people the opportunity to start thinking differently about their money\nAnd in this day and age when more and more people are looking for a second stream of income whether it's in renting out real estate whether it's super driving or you know charging these motor scooters that you see all over the place you know people are looking for other ways to generate income\nAnd there really is no better way to generate income than in the financial markets because part of this as it's not about giving you another full time job but part of this is how do you fit into your life\nHow do you fit to send to your schedule and generate income\nCommensurate with that commitment that you're willing to make and you know whatever it whatever it is you know whenever you get paid if you go work a second job you're going to get paid by the hour so maybe you get ten dollars an hour maybe get Fifteen dollars an hour maybe a twenty dollars an hour\nBut you really have an upper limit and one of the beauties of becoming a do yourself investor is you have total control of your income and you know if you want to make twenty dollars an hour you can do that you can also target making a hundred or two hundred or five hundred or a thousand\nDepending on what assets you have available on depending on your skills and so part of this is starting to sink bigger about yourself bigger about the opportunity but also realize why is this the best business in the world\nBecause if you've been in business and many many of our students come to us because they're business owners or they're looking at generating additional streams of income was certainly have a number of students that are retirees are pre retirees but a significant part of our student population or business owners\nAnd they recognize that it with their assets worth their time they\nBut a significant part of our student population or business owners and\nThey recognize that it would their assets worth their time they owe it to themselves to start generating multiple streams of income\nAnd part of what we do is we help people put together a success plan identify multiple strategies for current income identify multiple strategies for future income\nFor some people will help them develop some wealth creation strategies and also some preservation strategies with your assets and part of what makes this you know the best business in the world is you don't need to ask permission to be successful\nWhenever you work for someone else you basically have to ask permission to be successful you have to ask them for a job you have to ask them for hours and you basically your successes based on what someone else is willing to give tea\nWith being a do it yourself investor you have total control of your time\nAnd you don't need to ask for a vacation if you want it you can just go on vacation in fact we have some students that actively trade when they're off on their boat and so one of our students she joined us because she loves boating and you realize that she needed a way to generate income while she was off on their sail boat\nAnd so she does is he trades of twenty four hour market she trades the for X market so whenever she comes into port she'll log on to why into her opportunities and then you know when she's out of port you know those those opportunities trigger or they don't trigger\nBut that's the way for her to be generating more consistent income once he's doing exactly what she wants\nTo their accumulation investing model\nIs that you know you just got to build up and build up and you know millions and millions of dollars is what it's going to take\nAnd you know we have students that will say oh I Need six million dollars to retire I Need ten million dollars to retire any Fifteen million dollars to retire and that's true if you can only get three four or five percent on your money\nWas also true is that most people aren't going to have millions of dollars when they retire\nYou know Ninety eight percent of people that retire this year will not have a million dollars and so it's not that the accumulation model doesn't work it just doesn't work for you\nAnd what you need to do is be more active with that money and find better opportunities where you can get the probability on your side\nWe can leverage those assets and the understand how to manage your risk effectively and manage the risk and such a way that the reward that you're targeting is greater than any risk that you'll ever take\nAnd those three pieces are critical for you as you start building up your do it yourself and best her business and you know through our half day clash will be introduced to those and you have the ability to get probability on your side\nIs critical for people and we have a lot of people come and say I know I Love the markets I just don't know when to get in or when to get out well that's kind of the whole thing\n[laughter] so what one of the things that we have is what we call her core strategy and what that does is allow you to identify safer places to bind safer places to sell with any instrument whether you're going for short term trades or mid term trades are longer term opportunities\nAnd so by introducing this idea probability\nIt allows you to basically reduce your risk if you're having a higher probability opportunity and some more frequently you're going to be successful that'll help you and your overall business strategy\nAnd another thing that will help us figure out not just how to fit this endear schedule but also make sure that your assets are working for you and being more productive when you need them to be productive\nAnd you know my cousin called me a couple of weeks ago and we're talking about strategies and one of the things I introduced him to is that you know being in cash not being exposed to the market is a valid position\nAnd I know when the accumulation model is this idea that you always have to be invested and they'll say well if you ... if you miss the top ten days in the market each year than you returns will be a lot lower or if you also missed the top ten band days in the market your returns will be a lot higher\nAnd so part of it is we want you to be able to make knowing intentional moves with your money\nAnd a big part of treating with like a business and treating your finances like a business is that if you're more intentional our expectation as you're gonna have more businesslike returns with your money\nAnd if the goal is to be generating current income the goal is to be generating future income to be preserving what you've got\nAnd so what we're going to help you do is develop your own business plan and we were for that as you're sick success plan and your education your education provider will still work with you and help you develop that really figure out what your motivation and what we're really looking for people that are willing\nTo open their mind up to a new approach so you have to be comfortable you have to be willing to accept\nAnd what we're really looking for people that are willing to open their mind up to a new approach so you have to be comfortable you have to be willing to accept that there's ways that are different and better than what you're doing\nAnd so being ... real important also you know being disciplined not doing whatever you feel like\nBut giving yourself the opportunity to start like applying a systematic approach and think about every business you've ever been involved with whether you started at McDonald's or anywhere else everywhere you go has a system like there's a system for every job function for every business that's operating\nAnd so with your money one of the things that will help you do is develop your system for managing your money\nAnd you know by having your own individualized system that's going to allow you more freedom and more flexibility to really take advantage of the best business in the world\nAnd that's where by having your own system that you've proven to yourself works in a safe environment\nThen you're going to have a lot more confidence as you look for opportunities as a key part of how we teach you to become a do it yourself investor is when you're getting started you're gonna learn our core strategy but more importantly you're going to actually apply our core strategy live in the markets\nAnd by doing that in a safe environment you are going to be applying the core strategy with our money and so we're putting our money where our mouth is and part of that is it gives you if you're using someone else's asset we know you're going to be more careful with it\nWhen it comes to people and their own money we realize that people take an enormous risks because they really don't care about their money\nAnd I know that sounds funny of course I care about my money but the reality is we've we've been doing this for over Twenty years and we've seen that people take more care of someone else's money than their own so\nA key part of our learning experience a key part of becoming a do it yourself investor is learning how to take care of someone else's money when you learn those skills and develop your systematic approach to respecting capital\nThen when you start using your capital you're going to be a lot more systematic a lot more careful and a lot more measured as you're looking for opportunities\nAnd so you know our our system our education system is designed\nTo get you to accept and understand risk and understand how to take advantage of risk and do it at your own pace on your own speed and when you're ready after you build up your confidence you develop your optimism then to start putting it into action and start taking advantage of the opportunities that surround us every single day\nAnd that that's part of what makes this such a great businesses at once you have that approach no one can take it from you\nAnd one of the things we hear all the time here you know no one teaches this in high school known teaches us in college and that's what makes the online training academy such a special place because we're a school for people who want to learn how to make more money\nOr school for people that are looking for income strategies to solve their current income needs as well as their future income needs\nAnd there really is no other place like us and so hard about what to do is introduced shoot how we help people like you start developing the skills developing the confidence developing the attitude that you know you deserve to be able to generate income you need\nAnd you don't need to ask someone else permission to be successful\nIt's up to you to put in the time and energy and effort so you can be successful as do it yourself investor\nAnd at one of the things people always talk about is you know time control and his work life balance well if you can make the money you need an hour in the morning and then you have twenty three hours to do what you want that's pretty good time control\nAnd if you want to be successful at this you have to give yourself a opportunity to learn how does this fit into my current lifestyle and we have some students that are actively engaged every single day\nAnd they are they're totally all in their focus not a lot of those folks are tired or preparing for retirement most of our students don't do that you know we have some students that will do this you know twice a week\nSome students there once a week Simpsons who once a month\nSo part of making this you're the best business for you\nIs making sure that if it's in your schedule\nAnd becoming a do it yourself investors and very personalized approach a very individual approach\nAnd but in order to start becoming do it yourself investor you need to get educated so our sponsor online trading academies making ten seats available to a free half the class so you can learn how to become a do it yourself investor\nFor

involved in something to be\nA big believer in the power of we we we can tackle the challenges we face it feels community service and volunteer\nUnited we stand United we serve [noise] are you with me [noise] go to serve that go for more information about how to volunteer in your community message his boss of you by the survey the corporation for National Community service\nExactly right [laughter] it's kind of funny because you know and they're good people too but what what most students have actually told me as they are going through the process is man I don't know as much as I thought I Know\nAnd ah and you know and that's a that's a very humbling experience for a lot of people because then they're really able to connect the dots for themselves of why they're not achieving their financial goals and the timeframe that they're looking to achieve them\nAnd the other side of that as a as people realize that there's things that they don't know it's one else don't they know you know because in poverty is what is the source of their information and why are people giving them that information right\nChris I take a second I gotta tell you something so ... in my class were hit the nail on the head because this was this was quite funny just they're just a couple of days ago I was telling a student I go you know there are there are four levels of competence meaning for levels of understanding level number one is unconsciously incompetent\nOr you don't know you don't know nobody knows knows therefore you have no idea\nYour circle of friends don't know so you'll never know yeah second level is unconsciously competent where you think you know but this is third party stories where are you still have no idea but nobody you know still knows and so you really don't know and it's just their party stories [noise]\nThe third level is consciously incompetent and this is where this was a really good state for us as people to be especially when it comes to our finances and and these major life decisions because\nWhat a lot of people uh start to realize very quickly in our in our classes\nIs that this is a really good healthy place to be because again they'll they're able to connect the dots of why they're not achieving certain financial goals whatever it might be because his skill set as you note translates into ... and the different aspects of our life not just our finances but anyway it comes back to\nA consciously incompetent where people start to realize that yeah maybe I don't know as much as I thought I knew but then also they get to see somebody with the the the training and experience behind what it is that we're doing and that is the level of consciously competed and\nAnd when I was a lot of the people listening a lot of our students they know that what they're doing isn't working you know they know that\nThey've been getting a cup you know three percent a year the market's going up ten percent they're getting three percent markets up three hundred percent they've gotten maybe a hundred percent\nAnd they know that what they're doing isn't working isn't going to get them to a hundred they just don't believe or realize that there is a path of education that will provide for them to get better results\nThat's right and most people are afraid to step through that door because we have all bought into the same system and leave it up to the professionals well once people do allow themselves the opportunity to at least come in and see what we do and how we do it it's a much different story from there\nAnd they know how I got started in this business so I've been trading for\nAt the time about eight years and I have a ... account with Charles Schwab ... and I got a call and Charles Schwab guy said oh we want to come in and we can review your finances and it's a great here's a guy who really knows what he's talking about right and I'm going to go in and I sit down and my wife comes in\nAnd I sit there and within five minutes I was like this guy had no idea what I have done it has no idea how to actually make any money right and that was part of my motivation I was like there is a huge opportunity to help people do this\nAnd has no idea how to actually make any money right and that was part of my motivation I was like there is a huge opportunity to help people do this the right way yeah\nAnd I've had that happen before too and and even being in the industry myself having worked for a couple of different brokers out of Chicago\nAnd and er an uh well actually both of them were based out of Chicago um [noise] you know what a lot of people don't realize is that those financial advisors broker dealers ... you know it's not a good person batteries in conversation is more so they have a job to do their job is to put them in the funds that their company needs them to get rid of\nGenerally Hi fi higher expense and the thing that's changed over certainly in the last Fifteen Years right but they're the value that you're paying for isn't very high no and and basically you know if you're ... most of the most of what they're trying to give you some it's tracking the market\nBut he ended up not doing as well as the average because the fees and expenses and all these other timing things so they're putting you in a below average investment and you get to pay above average fees\nRight and that's not yeah and most of them don't include a the rate of inflation too when you get when you ... that in a lot of people now start to realize\nWow this is where my money's going no wonder why I'm not where I Need to be\nClosest like cable t._v. right I mean if if you paid a hundred dollars a month for cable TV and you only got one channel would you keep paying for it not at all [laughter] right or the veil once in a while and you would definitely cut the cord\nAnd you know if you're paying for premium service you expect a premium result exactly and I think that's the fundamental problem is that you're paying for premium service and getting below average results that's right and\nWhat a lot of people don't realize is the time commitment that the brokers have nowadays versus twenty thirty forty years ago has been cut in in in the dirt matter of fact they're spending a third of the time managing people's portfolio but still charging the same amount of money that\nThey were way back when and but even let's get back to any other service like any other service that you are paying a premium for if you got bad service what would you do\nWhen we turn it off yeah right an RV or if you went to a restaurant and they want to charge you a hundred bucks and you got a hotdog what would you do for another ... or a whole bunch of hot dog [noise] and so it's just part of the people have been bamboozled into thinking that they're they're it's okay to pay a premium\nAnd get below average results right\nAnd you know and and the lows long of it is is is one of the things that are students realize you know it it's your money\nAnd you're going to make the decisions you want to you and so one of the things that I was a tell my students is is you know if if you came here to change and then let let's show you how to do that because obviously um there is room to room for improvement and what a lot of people will also realize is\nIs that in a lotta times they are doing a lot of things right\nEven if they're making some of the individual decisions but uh if if they if they are at least open minded to tweak a couple of things a little bit my goodness gracious to the the type of strategies that open up formed the type of ah [noise]\nUm the opportunities are are are just endless and what a lot of people also realizes that ultimately they might not need that financial

job of the president is now compared to what you thought of it\nIt would be when you started and uh this is again Mr Baldwin talking about a question he would ask Mr Trump and\nHe also talked about the Trump Canada a character that he created a and he he kind of a launch that on a public before the twenty sixteen election even began and so the Hollywood Reporter said well what were your

often stories you're not hearing anywhere else in interviews you're not hearing anywhere else she hosts full measure and tomorrow morning on full measure ABC seven to ten o'clock\nI'm very very interesting interview and Sheryl it's great to have you with us\nAnd crack well tomorrow you're talking with Karen Monaghan\nNot quite a household name but may become one because of the rocky relationship she's head with representative Keith Ellison the Democratic Minnesota we've heard about this story he's running for attorney general she's made allegations and you talk with their tomorrow\nYeah he's running for Minnesota tourney general that he thought the number two Democrat National Committee official\nAnd um he had had a long term relationship with him back not into beard uh what is going to be that she claimed after they're bad breakup that he had been physically and emotionally actually being said to her for a long period of time with the denied\nAnd what I think is really one of the interesting parts of the story is how confusing this environment is hold me to my dad I mean you know there are all kinds of different standards being applied and confusion between allegations of rape and just sort of bad behavior\nThat's been examples she says\nHer getting no support from her own party she's a longtime lifelong Democrat getting no support in the way that she sees Christine scored got when she made her charges against the Supreme Court nominee cabinet in other words she thinks there's a double standard within the Democratic party\nOr question for me what are women can be believed only when they cute\nCertain people but not when they choose certain Democrat and I think he raises an important issue I'm One of the things he shared with with some of her evidence which were turned over to investigators she's not trying to pass criminal charges by the way she did\nKind of went to college or in what she called healing but she did have medical records from a year ago\nCriminal charges by the way she did kind of want the others are and what she called healing\nBut she did have medical records from a year ago that discuss what she alleged happen she did have three witnesses come forward and talk to investigators that say she told them about that at the time you know over a year ago\nSo in her mind she has more evidence and\nFord had and yet she thought you know a big rallying cry support around for that she hasn't seen so that's what we're talking to her that\nWell it's the double standard where's the uproar where the protesters surrounding his office or his campaign rallies I'm not seeing any of that\nWell she certainly haven't gotten the same level of attention I support there was a Democrat Party investigation and part of that kind of fixing our call a little bit too because it was handled by the Democrat Party in Minnesota\nAnd that actually you know I looked at the report did a fairly narrow investigation that came up with the conclusion that they've kind of her word against him and say you can't make you know you can't make a determination they couldn't substantiate her physical abuse claim that's all they looked at as her wind claim of physical abuse\nAnd yet as he points out she had witnesses and medical records that they found were credible they just also found that Allison look credible as well when he denied that these things happen\nAgain whoever you believe I think their point is one you know well raised which is if the standard is simply that women it can be believed no matter kind of who they are and what they say why isn't she\nAnd if the case is that they're not necessarily be believe that it's to be based on certain evidence what is the standard then what is the standard of proof that someone has to bring\nAnd is there a level of hypocrisy probably thing I Would guess within both parties as these issues are raised depending on who the allegations are against\nIt was so interesting to watch Dr Ford's testimony\nAnd to try and gauge you know for ourselves was she telling the truth or was she confused did she have\nA Brett Kavanaugh confused with someone else it will be fascinating to watch tomorrow when you interview Karen Monaghan on full measure to see how we all reacts to what she has to say and and how she presents her accusations\nI think people will be interested to hear it you know I wrote on the fact that we can listen to people and make our own judgment it doesn't mean we are any better informed or that we know where to close to the truth because you know we're we're ... air in our own judgment when we try to decide the thing and yet\nI think people really find her story interesting and also her point that the evidence that she brought forward\nIt significantly higher than what was presented in that case of sport and Kavanaugh and yet again like she said she's not had advocacy groups roster her side or defend her how her\nSuch tomorrow morning on ABC seven o'clock

have a security threat especially a high security clearance to go through a periodic ah what's it called bring up investigation\nAnd uh let's be honest here there's a lot of derogatory information out there which would have made any investigation problematic everybody has to go through that has a clearance so I think uh you know this question being the better part of valor frankly Rick I think she wanted us to quietly past I don't think she wanted any\nAnything can be drawn to this but you know in that one never knows but yes the idea here is she a longer has the clearest\nNor does Cheryl Mills

like this\nYou think after dealing with this for Twenty years that they figure it out to happen so this is this is a huge blow to the program and I'm One of those things it's it's about time we started looking for a different direction of is not going to work\n[noise] I don't want to turn to this whole question of a mob versus right to protest\nAnd I you know I don't generally get inflammatory on Saturday morning so we just kind of like the you know present the stories and and look paint is how about you know we're not here to ratchet it up like all the pundits are over CNN I mean there's not like an eight activists here trying to get everybody all tore the truck\nBut I just want to get into this question of\nMob versus right to protest I get it when there's a right to protest you assemble peacefully\nAnd you protest and people do it in the middle of Pennsylvania Avenue without a permit and the police protect them and they stopped traffic and rush hour\nAll right I'm not crazy about it but that's the right to protest however when you walk into a restaurant\nSurround a senator and harassed and yell and scream that's a mob and that is mob harassment I don't care what anybody says on CNN MSNBC or any of the other one's\nWhy it is and let's be clear on this so you have the right to defend yourself and I think this is for the the dangerous going in this especially\nIn places like Virginia and other states where they're much more apt to protect the individual over them off I mean let's be honest here the people get away with this ... if they think the malls will be on molested in many places it is\nNice see for example you know they've had very little pushback to these people doing is one of the consequences but not as much as there should be\nThat we've really got to look at this from the perspective of security\nUh Virginia for example you get these mobs and get protests ah Virginia moves very rapidly to stop a there's laws which allow them to do that and obviously worry or the second amendment stay open carry and and big on personal defense so\nUh the mob has its own ability to get in trouble and uh in certain places I think I probably may result in and violence of those pushing back against\nIn its own ability to get in trouble and or in certain places I think I travel may result in violence of those pushing back against them so you and I want to be civil I think we've always tried to have a civil dialogue [noise] um but the problem is certain words as uncle up to include Hillary Clinton\nWho just lost her security clerics are is saying that the civil civility needs to be suspended very dangerous\nWell this whole idea of getting their face and holders comments the other day that he said were blown out of proportion but kicking Republican so I mean you know that can be taken the wrong way rather easily Mr retired general\nIf it if it can be taken the wrong way it will be a way and that's the danger here so my advice to those snowflakes you really want to get in people's faces a better deal with in a way that doesn't put you in legal jeopardy that someone can come back at you because again you know this is not Portland, Oregon and I don't think these are people\nUnderstand that you know this is very dangerous [noise] uh there's always great it's great to protest but when you start getting people's faces things really Russia very fast\nBut what you were threatened then when you feel threatened then if somebody feels danger or feels threatened and not going to be pretty\nNot at all so I think we all well agree that everybody listening to our voices today needs to consider the consequences of any a stupid ac chance to\nGrow up as they say\nLieutenant colonel Tony say for vice president strategic initiatives and
