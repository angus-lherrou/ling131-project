discuss immigration because they know that's a losing topic for them they're telling them to stay laser focused on health care health care health care health care\nWhy because in polls in that have have been done the polls also show that health care\nIs a very strong concern for a lot of people that's coming around again Americans have the attention span is they often say of golden retriever puppies\nAnd so we're focused on on on the economy economy is a big thing then something else happens and it was a migration is the big thing then something else I'm In the health care is the big thing so so we we kind of change what's the most important issue for us at any given time\nThis caravan this invasion may bring I think the Democrats are afraid that this invasion is going to bring immigration to the fore again\nAnd that we're all going to start to say oh immigration is a big problem because this is a huge visual seven thousand plus people marching towards the board of the visual of them and tearing down the border fence in uh southern Mexico\nYou know that's a huge visual and Democrats do not want that to be the focus because they know that's a losing issue for them [noise]\nSo there is Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer sent out a memo telling telling democratic candidates to stay away from immigration do not discuss it\nRight but they uh they claim he's trying to change the topic I as a first of all the topic wasn't even on health care\nBut they like it to be a just has been this has been the simmering thread through the litter the bare bones of what Democrats are running on for months and they've not I've ... never in the news and then that and that's an a Democrat controlled media I mean there do they just can't even get to it they are so\nHysterical about Donald Trump on any given day that um and going out for Brett Kavanaugh on destroying him things like that that they're they're always there they can't stay focused on their agenda item there one agenda item\nUm but now they're saying well this is just one mass destruction and the vulnerabilities are real here I mean Democrats are I think realize that enough Americans are looking at us like wait a second seven thousand people are marching towards the United states\nAnd they expect to just come in\nWithout problems just come into the United states and that's it I think a lot of people look at like ... uh what point do we kinda get control of the system do we have a border or is everybody entitled to the United states like this is the whole planet entitled to come here because Honduras and not the only place that has economic trouble\nA lot of places of economic trouble we live in America we're insulated from it but it across the world there's a lot of people want to come in\n... and their economic problems than ... ... ... a plunge us into economic problems you know what I mean because we know that when low skilled workers come into this country what does that do that drives the wages down for American low skilled workers it drives wages down because a lot of them will work under the table because they can't work legally\nAnd ends up people that well you should've forceful was well then those people won't get jobs at all and now now there are a problem they're good they're they're not working now now what do we do with them\nSo so it it brings a lot of economic problems in this as you were just starting to get the economy rolling again and this is this\nIs the point it's like if you want to if you're like a Cory Booker Kamala Harris for one of these Democrats who's very focused on income inequality on income inequality and saying to yourself you know what we need to do we need to help the lower end have more wealth if you want to accomplish

that\nHe I you know the the the mainstream crafts like portray the term national as you know and I'm sure there are already\nYou know running footage of stepping Nazis well you know that there's a big

think at the time that um they were dealing with the Rob Porter scandal which is why Lewandowski had made some comments on television\nThat weren't a glowing about John Kelly and as a result maybe Kelly was upset with him but look\nThis is you know this is it's amazing that it was February ... many months ago yeah something like this weather has been kept under the lid for so long and hasn't

it that he's been pretty effective at um at tampering down on them\nWhich is why I Do question this because it has stayed under wraps for so long so why now why leak it out now if it is true but

know that your caller and throw you against a wall um\nThat adds to that um they're trying to keep up the idea of chaos in the White House and in this administration\nAnd this helps feed that

going to flare and sometimes it's going to come down to shouting and maybe even becoming physical where you're like alright alright alright knock it off and you and you pull somebody off and somebody

about like ...\nThey're really not engaging with President Trump on the issue so we just we just saw it as big an NBC Wall Street Journal poll which is a near showing the president at its highest the

about this migrant immigration at this migrant invasion\nIt does is hurt the Democrats do they know that this this visual hurts them or are they going to be able to use it and use the media complicit

president may be sending troops to the border are they going to be able to leverage that\nWhole ... immigration is one of those issues that extremely dicey for both parties and when you had a lot of

that and really hurt the Democratic party what when the issue comes up with other ways I Am this move the migrant care of it and I think is one of those examples when people ... and I think I think generally the position of of of the public is supportive of legal immigrants they support immigration writ large\nBut when you have people trying to cross illegally and you have these rituals that are out there I think that turns off a lot of lot of voters that it's not just conservative job you know it depends on how people are talking about immigration that NBC Wall Street Journal poll I was talking about give Democrats\nAn ... point advantage or which party is better equipped to deal with immigration but that's a smaller advantage and they've had in the past and given the coverage of

protesting\nWhat about the house fine because that seems we're all the energy is now in terms of trying to sort it out what what's happening with the house\nWell I mean I think it would you look at the house the Senate it's it's really a battle of the suburbs where Democrats are really energized and I think Democrats I was just in California\nAnd there are a lot of suburban races out there where Democrats may may pick up a few seats but in a lot of these red state Senate races Republicans picked up two or three Senate race to increase that must be the next\nExpand their majority by fifty

S.\nAnd one of the things that we all want to comment or friends that we hear is\nWell why aren't you being good humanitarian why can't you address their humanitarian problem and the problems range from fleeing violence right to economic concerns out an economic concern is not a rationale for\nSmith they hate interior enforcement they do not like people being deported who are here illegally the only time you're allowed to engage with an illegal immigrant in the eyes of of ... of of institutional Democrats is if they show up on the border that's it beyond that if they're in the interior of the country don't worry about it unless they committed violent crime no problem yeah\n... and you don't know who any of these people are hit the same people probably lock their doors at night which I Do find a tad ironic Mike in Frederick Mike you're on mornings on the mall time\nMore than guys [noise] this is actually that complicated of an issue and we don't really need any new laws\nUm the international treaty on a ... states that you are to apply for asylum in the first country you arrive in after fleeing your country yes\nThese people are not even beginning to try to follow the laws and treaty that have already been established in order to help them\nSo if you show up at our border and you can't prove that you have applied for and been denied asylum in every country you pass through on the way here along with showing proof of why you were denied asylum in those three countries but no you can't commit\nWell that's exactly right so that's why the game as you know my kids just to illegally immigrate and then not show up for your hearing\nI mean that's it that it's it's not it's not actually get asylum ... that you're right you have to apply in Mexico in Mexico has had to have had denied due in order for you to successfully apply in the United states and that is not happening you know they're just pushing through the gate and walking up to America\nAnd that's that's why they're coming at seven thousand strong seven thousand plus strong it's just overwhelming and do exactly what they did in Mexico where if you overwhelm the border and you just make this huge assault on our border they know that unless the president puts military on the border you're not going to stop them and if they break up into smaller groups yeah they're just going to overwhelm\nThe border don't want to cross it all different part of the old\nBack on one point the whole humanitarian thing\nThere's always this idea that the government is supposed to be the source of all humanitarian aid that everything that we express in terms of how we take care of people should be done through the federal government none of horses wrong that generosity with other people's money if you want to be generous be personally generous give to the charities are concerned with the things gives you the NGOs that are concerned with these things\nBut don't constantly say the federal government needs to serve your moral purposes because the fact because that way lies chaos yep yeah\nEight eight six zero nine sixty five pound Gainesville makes a good point here Paul good morning your eye mornings on them all\nMorning guys here's the point I Want to make the key to this is educating our public they need to know how wrong these immigrants she's a legal work starts illegal immigrants are in coming into our country without try applying for a visa\nWhy do we have why did we invest hundreds of millions of dollars building conflict all over the world so that would be these applicants can pay their fees are formed be interviewed by a counselor officer have to prove that they are worthy of even a tourist visa\nCake why don't we have that legal that law and order of your process or we're going to let people people flock of illegals\nInto our country what is the point of having to offer an orderly immigration system somebody explained that can be\nNear making you're making and you're making sense your opponents in this conversation or not it's not about that is just about getting people into the country it's not even about what the rules are\nAnd along with that done it in Frederick very quickly her done have you got about thirty seconds left but he can make a really good point wanted to get in here in the morning\nI of course I you know the thing that we as we often our borders language and culture\nAnd got a point I Want to make waves races contrary we've invited everyone on everywhere in this country you know we can't forget that and number two\nI think it has not worked to at least figure out who or and I think we're finding is coming from and go after them back where the problem today and that's where it is\nAnd yeah that would take ... rather than the romance novels we keep getting from the press about everything that's coming up towards us [laughter]\nBut that goes to the point everyone's making we got some treating this like it's a regular immigration this is an invasion this has been organized overwhelmed the border\nTo just have a mass flood into the country totally unmanageable and now to this is about and that's why I think the president needs to send troops to the border stop it and say no we have a system you need to follow\nIt All right I'm going to throw house party this weekend and then we're going to have a

McCarthy who's now probably most publicly famous for not only being a Republican\nFor backing this border build that he's advertising everywhere that he wants to basically you know he was he supports says he supports building walls more border security so all of a sudden he's getting attacked by activists for people who dislike him or whatever because of his politics\nIs the point that if you're saying that Kevin McCarthy is full of hate that he's not treating people with enough love you're going to throw rocks through his window to express\nThat well that's because President Trump started it with his hateful rhetoric of his violent rhetoric or what have you didn't need to tell them to go to he put her to die who who body slammed a reporter there is no there is no room for that kind of hate\nIn this country and then he blames the Democrats for hateful rhetoric and heat and things that they do violence if he comes from the top down\nYeah well this is the president's fault this

revealing what appeared to be an explosive device appeared to be an explosive device police and the employee put the package in the woods and wait until the cops arrived the police to bomb squad deactivated the device according to authorities police are investigating I hear the FBI is also looking into this um\nSo of course is highly inappropriate and uh to the idea that you would send anything that even looks like an explosive to anybody for their political views but color me skeptical\nBecause I only only because like how many times have we seen these like campus hoaxes where you get these liberal activists to spray paint something racist on a wall and try and convince everyone that it was Republican or did it like I have no idea what actually happened here obviously we wait for details\nBut you know George Soros at the center of a lot of Republican discontent by the way totally plausible to think that it was some right wing or who did this to and you imagine if you get

whose job it is just scream these very things it doesn't have to make sense these are lunatics for sending saying well that's\nWhy you laughed at me but again my initial thought was who's ... who
