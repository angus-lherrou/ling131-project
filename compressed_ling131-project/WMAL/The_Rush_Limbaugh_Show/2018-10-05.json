named Jennifer Rubin [noise]\nUh yeah it is Jennifer Rubin it's amazing transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger then when Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just the died the cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has the there's still the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative van MSNBC reversed her that way but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes to the deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative there and saying on MSNBC the female Democratic senators are being sold emotional almost just Derek ... behaving is it\nAnd on MSNBC the female Democrat senators were being so emotional almost hysterical behaving as if it's their time of the month does anybody think that would\nThe two thousand sixteen election to keep the coalition that voted for Trump together now a lot of us ... that if people voted for Trump in two thousand six day that they did sell for very specific reasons\nAmong them Trump is alone in fighting the Washington establishment that Trump is alone in in in pushing back against Democrats and the so called Washington conventional wisdom\nAnd then the assumption is that if people knew that in two thousand six day and that they would not forget that and if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that is the\nKavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in the midterms\nIn other words in her study of things just continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there don't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the catalyst\nBecause of how Trump voters the purse and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive from the way he is being treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populists coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they edit things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that the targets of rage has somewhat diminished until Kavanaugh came along and real wake\nAnd these people and fired them back up so she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to that Kavanaugh\nHas served as a reminder Anna highlights to the people that voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAny other Republican president would have walked away from cabinet by now energy would have been lost but it's not energy is high [noise] now
