people on television was talking afraid of Cuomo who's on that list as well\nAnd they were talking about recent shootings and mailed the pipe bombs in Frisco said the lemon and there was another hate filled criminal just last week to talk of the white guy in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store\nAnd do we barely had time to work very hard time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realize the biggest terror threats in this country is white men most of it I'm radicalized to the right\nAnd we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy ban\nWell there you have a my friends there is there's non eleven um we need a white guy ban to go along with the travel ban andme a Muslim ban because the biggest terror threat in this country right now is white men [noise]\nThis of course ignores all of the people of color protests marches antifa who inflicting damage and harm on people of course the black lives matter\nA group but you see 'em\nWe're going to start attaching blame the people who don't really have any responsibility for making the bombs or pulling the trigger on the guns who isn't that isn't raging them like I say you cannot turn on the news today and find a single thing positive about anything\nYou can't you you cannot find any reinforcement anywhere in public media for the good innocent decency of America it's quite the exact opposite and since these\nPeople are of a vast majority immediate you know they exempt themselves from having any role in all of this while they are eager to try to find anybody else in the media who might be to blame for this\n\nDon Lemon and said let's see it Monday Night also that he doesn't see Democrats killing people over politics\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter Arnie Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nIn the sense well there are cops and they mistreatment racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound to people states can we almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand six team\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or are they Republicans know many of them are very loyal\nDemocrat voting bloc Muslim Americans in fact maybe even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\nAccording to Forbes magazine of the free thousand three hundred and forty two people killed by terrorists in the U.S between Nineteen Ninety two in two thousand Seventeen Islamic\nTerrorists are responsible for Ninety two percent of those murders and yeah Don Lemon on CNN says the problem\nIs white men we need a white men than there is no white guy ban\nBut he said no one must have are playing the left no one must ever blame the news media don't one must ever blame the rest of the Democratic party for any of the attacks done by their rabbits like Occupy Wall street white black lives matter like antifa\nThe truth is he doesn't Republicans running around doing these things [noise]\nHe is a bunch of deranged people who are out of their minds and I'm telling you\nIt can happen\nTo

that's not mentioned no Trump is ratcheting down his visa had been pedaled through the metal and here's the opinion of David ...\nWe ought to go back and think about you know how Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma studying I'm Nineteen Ninety five\nHandles he doesn't go after the terrorists who doesn't turn up my visa drums or to go out and and stock with terrorists all around the country tried to heal and it was a turning point as president say he was embattled when he went to Oklahoma City that turns his presence around the very positive direction\nThis is how history revision has works there David ... saying that Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five inhaled he didn't go after the\nTerrorists\nHe didn't start in America you know beat the drums to go out and stop the terrorists\nWell\nLet's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five ... in Minneapolis\nHere so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up an upset with each other they spread hey they leave the impression that there are very words that violence is acceptable\nWith each other they spread hey\nThey leave the impression that there are very words that violence is acceptable you ought to see you I'm sure you're announcing the reports of some things that are regularly send over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech and\nI Know you've been talking about Nineteen Ninety five there is no Fox knows the blogosphere and meet some of the airwaves or this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nBut at the White House felt some have had their she'll correct just say no we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network disappointment by angry voices on the right\nThe Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guy hiking around in the woods with some guns wearing camel gear and the media had video of it but the Michigan Militia it was a non factor in any of this you get rid of it there's Clinton zeroing in on it when it's attempt to blame me\nBombed out so but you said Clinton you didn't do that no he was trying to heal he didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorist heated and sort of beat the drums install the jurors all over the he tried to heal it was a tournament this is\nAgain history revision is an extraordinary one more by this was a wolf blitzed\nAnd judge Jeffrey Cuban\nLast night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI were the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing or Clinton was President Bill Clinton was the name was he delivered a beautiful speech who was a very very warmly received there were no protesters going on for you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occurred to me that there would have been protests say\nSo now there were no protests for Obama there's no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nTrump's guilty But Trump's at fault it's the protestors are right\n\nWhy weren't they are any protests back in those days old second look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\nPrecisely me cause no less very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a

single story about it\nBecause the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurting Democrats or Republicans in the in the mid term elections\nHere's another one is that Kevin confirmation circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose about getting\nJustice if it was to make sure that these women that were so low on and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them that why is justice not being sought and the longer and the answer to\nThe question is it was never about the women because none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even men destroying his family and his career his future and his\nLife and they failed so now it's on

getting any updates from a drive by media about all of these women were sold mistreated by Kevin ...\nWhat does it mean that the Democrats are not being asked by the media whether they support Kevin O's impeachment wise it's all been dropped\n\nWhy have the media given up investigating the story they obsessed over for nearly a month\nFor weeks September and October that's all the media talked about [noise]\nWhere's the follow up if Kavanaugh was as they say that story should not have gone away the women still suffered the women did not get justice Kavanaugh got confirmed where is the news where is the continuing investigation well it doesn't exist because it was all made up about capital\nClassic Democratic Party media operation so is the aftermath of the pipe bomb story and so as the

program so over Thirty years in one way thank you very much a Ella for the call I really I'm I'm Glad you got through to remind us about Alice Alice I not only by the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nHow we were much newer and younger country them and we had an entirely different attitudes about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people do things through accidents or or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed\nIn had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nYou had to learn about American history you have to promise that you're going to do your best to learn the English language if it was restricted because it was predicated based on the fact that we weren't in charge of who was going to live here\nThe world was not in title ... percent entirely different vantage it back then but even then\nI read books I remember a conversation with my grandfather who lived to be a hundred and four he was born\nIn Eighteen nineties his life spanned pre electricity\nTo going to the moon in his life he saw all of that he grew up on a farm had to go plow fields before school every day come home after school work the farm and so forth and like all the stories everything they didn't sell is what\nThey got to eat um\nHe was one of the first in is why they got the first to ah to go to college it became a lawyer\nBut he\nCame from the horse and buggy days and no electricity to manned spaceflight landing on the motives thought all and I remember I was I was home in\nMissouri I guess Nineteen Ninety two years after appropriated like yesterday Nineteen Ninety [noise]\nAnd he's around Ninety these so called close to a hundred years old and he's asking is uh what what are the big thing was it was hard of hearing when there's times you couldn't here to radio easily and one of the big things being discussed on your program say immigration we called and pop\nPop you would not believe it I mean I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run this was\nThis was all the folks this was all and back in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know I remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days Ellis Island you immigration has been\nA polarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to him a ... on the new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people who didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe I ever people it's his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance [noise]\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety when we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration\nHe was saying but back in the early Nineteen hundreds late Eighteen hundred the controversy then it was about legal immigration and even with legal immigration to repeat them opposed to opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity and they come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what extent the day the\nThe opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity to come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what her said today\nThe differentiating thing today is that legal immigration is seldom even discussed\nAnd we have both political parties and predominantly one of them now advocating for lawlessness advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples that racism and bigotry\nSo forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial\nThing immigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship for amnesty upon their arrival\nThat is what's new to this debate and that is what the ah the Democrats or the American left today are are advocating and they're doing so on the premise that America is responsible for the economic\nPlight of these people that we as a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources we've gone around the world and cake and what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so\nIt liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthier than somebody asked me poor up there and so therefore the American people are guilty of something\nThere's an unequal distribution of wealth Gillette says and all of these countries in Central America South America so poor compared to us and it's not that it's got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy is in war torn strife\nThat the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion and the real purpose behind it is to transform America into the kinds of nation it was never intended are founded debate and that's the difference of the legal and illegal immigration\nTo the subject has been around it's been
