I think this package bombs are means of disrupting these elections to the point where they can then say\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group planting bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing into turmoil I really do\nYou think that as we sit here today the deep state they are going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats than they've stayed thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws as they can say the election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way you ... and you really think that the\nThe deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation designed to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts hearing aids the left\nWhen in fact they orchestrated if you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I would've said I'm Crazy I mean I I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\n[noise] I mean you're talking about some very high profile people being out a lot of trouble\nTheoretically that he'll ... eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why isn't that happening now the Republicans round the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again in order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do\n\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it once was elections are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him they if they really\nJust a moment we'll let's discuss it you'd think Trump is essentially on the ballot in in this election there's no wrong answer I don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you think that Trump is essentially on the ballot this\nThese midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in total are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble when the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left think this is going to be their big moment where they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this was the beginning of the unpredictable\nI Will do something with it I was I was reading a a tech blog yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby not keeping up with the blockers meant keeping up with the\nTech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read this stuff\nAnd it's all written by a bunch of young millennial journalist and\nThey have ever since election day two thousand sixteen they haven't been in various stages of\nPanic and I I'm a ...\nWas a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll\nShowing the rent wave of the blue wave was not going to happen it was not nearly as big\nAnd this particular blogger was in a mild to panic about\nWriting about you know what we all had been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty in was an odd confluence of events that that gave us a one off result it's not really representative of America that Donald Trump and these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says but if the Republicans hold the house of representatives and\nWe're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are and that we are not running the show in truth\nAnd it was it was um it was like I wouldn't say there was panic and ended up reading the written word but it's slowly dawning on some of the last two years they have live with the belief that what happened in two thousand sixteen\nWas unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events have bad candidate with\nHillary Clinton and so forth over confidence by people on the left but that um people had been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistaken the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nUm do to people who have been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistake of the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday in November and correct dismissing now they're starting to begin to quite\nMay be this is not an oddity maybe maybe we're not the majority and it kind of dovetails with what you're saying here do you believe for example that a Trump\nVoters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum devote because of the moms now\nGo rush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went out at Trump's rally two weeks ago it was an it was in Council Bluffs right across the river and I think the uh mid America center seats for this event was seeding like twelve thousand\nI'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line\nThere were more women than there were men that were going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters\nAnd my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters one I got down there\nLike me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that and it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act like they do and so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and out how how could you hold it against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country I mean he really is\nAnd I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now realize that they got their momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing their sleeves like these crazy radical leftists are all doing\nWell it is it is a ... it's it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that this week a bomb scare stories can\nDampen enthusiast I I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more maybe I think more than the average Trump voter I I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the state and yet there are people\nLet's continue you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is because I think they already know I I'm I'm\nI don't sense that there is a\nUsual lessening of enthusiasm Oregon gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is it that was it it's as important now is it wasn't to thousands sixteen\nAnd in fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and the policies have been enacted the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies I think the ... the rally in Houston\nHe was talking about how he he produced he's got he's got a track record now he said\nTwo years ago in the campaign and I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again and we're going to stop there's going to make a trade deals better but back\nThen it was just words he said was just words but now two years later I produced meeting is not just words it's real now and I think Trump supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um the attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to disparate them a or to somehow we give them their enthusiasm so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you

microphone\nWe have photos of the things that can approve of this before there were ... but but the fact of the condom being placed the microphone was a mistake of all\nAnd then after the condom was
