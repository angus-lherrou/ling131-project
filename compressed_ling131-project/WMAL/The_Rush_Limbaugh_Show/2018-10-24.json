had about ... wherever but bombs had to walk\nOr yes a bomb was sent to a ... saying oh we're also being told her that her mom was sent the Debbie ... show and that a up the bomb in addition to see and it was addressed to John\nBrennan who does that work there\nJohn Brennan is a analyst commentator over at MSNBC and they're probably saying what about us\nToday [noise] so how how are we our way to see this um the drive by media would love for everybody to see this in a vacuum as though there aren't any events that could possibly\nMe it related to this\nAnd couldn't be anything out there that could explain this except of course\nPresident Trump we've already had there's just there's just really deranged guy that worked for Hillary Clinton named ... brand is already out there claiming that Trump did this at Trump's inspiring that the Trump is behind this\nUh James was noted Hollywood blacklisted actor has said that it's obvious to him that this is a political stunt for the leading up to the to the mid terms\nI have been scouring my fertile memory\nAnd I can't come up with a I Can't come up with any or even a significant number of instances in the past I'm Republican bomb threats Republican or threats of violence\nThis told us what happened in an off year election this was going to be the Democrats electrical ever going to show up in in droves energized they were going to be so excited they were going to be so motivated Republican early voting is dwarfing there's nothing out there other than Nate Silver and a couple of our polling suggest\nA blue wave and what kind of blue way it's gonna be if it doesn't include\nThe Senate there's some people now that think the Republicans might end up uh fifty seven fifty eight seats in the Senate\nIt's all a toss up I mean nobody really knows right now but the point is the conventional wisdom is not settled on what the Democrats always thought it would have been telling us it would be and that is Republican massive landslide defeat that doesn't look to be in the car so if you're a Democrat operative\n[noise] and the mob tactics haven't worked [noise] and in fact\nThat you're a reasonable democratic operative when you're looking at this objectively you might make including this mob\nAction could be her saying it could be really firing up Republican turnout as in the post Kavanaugh period there is a cabinet affected it's going one way pro Republican documented\nOr one of these mobs only did the Republicans minding their own business in restaurants and in airports what if these mobs attacking people aren't doing anything to anybody and sending supposedly rice and [noise]\nTo Republican Senator Susan Collins if you're a Republican or a rather a democratic operative you might start\nTo conclude this is going the exact opposite way we intended ah these moms are not inspiring even more hatred of Trump these moms are not\nCausing even more hatred of Republican and in fact is looking like it's\nCreating more support for Republican so what would be the best way if you are a democratic operative and your panicking right now because this is it if you don't if you don't get the house now\nYou've got two more years of Trump and expanded Republican Senate Republicans keep the house Trump's brief history election and twenty ... this is it just like we think it's it for us\nBut they have thrown everything they had given Trump's they've thrown have they've had the FBI they have had that deep state silent cool they have thrown every trick media Akhil lights doing they're tough lifting for them and none of it none of it none of it has worked\nSo what would you do Democrat operating for best way to turn all of that around\n[noise] how about a day like this\nHow about a day like this where you create a scenario where it looks like a moms are on both sides it looks like the Republicans have a mob to or at least in a say any actors some Republican out there sending bombs decent good\nDemocrats and media people former Democratic presidents and and as a harmless fit what CNN wouldn't it serves the our purpose if you're a Democrat operative to make it look like the Republicans are a bunch of insane lunatics and hamster mobsters on their side as well\n\nVery same people in the media says Republicans hate the most isn't this interesting George Soros Hillary the Obamas CNN\nI mean surely surely that will convince the great on washed out there that there are dangerous an angry mobs on both sides it's not just Democrats who have angry mom so I guess a Republican to what you may be I think the day like this could help neutralize\nThe image that has sprung the life of the Democrats are a little bit Texan and saying\nI mean we're ...

they are entitled to it\nAnd whatever it is denied them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happened which are the voters\nSo today's American leftist angry as it can be that people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them they left his making every\nEvery effort it can to distance Trump voters from Trump\nThey've tried everything they know how to use to damage Trump to force him out of office to force cabin all out of the nomination to try to convince Trump voters they made a mistake none of it's worked the degree of frustration they are feeling is something you and I cannot relate\nTo we can try\nBut the degree of frustration they're feeling at having lost that election and two thousand sixteen when they thought it was a landslide victory and subsequently everything they've had the most powerful influential people in their movement all coordinated working together to destroy Donald Trump\nAnd it's been like ... you know spit balls at a at a at a battleship they haven't Denton Trump and I cannot tell you how frustrated they are\nEither easy for them to take out Republicans whenever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously\nBut they haven't been able to even score on Trump salt they began this movement of promoting\nIn the media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fat they and they created a whole cloth something that did not exist a national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes then it began reporting the news that way\nEverybody hates Trump that now that they've seen combination I hate him to despising they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became the narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now that people have seen trumpet action I've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left taste not everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every

blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now we're learning much of that was made up much of that was soap operas scripted media

N. A. L. more Washington comes to talking\nAnd\nHere's another story of this from Bloomberg News tolls could be missing a Republican syringe here's why\nCertainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks for pollsters ... the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all\nThis down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and it was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the\nDemocrats doing massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the\nThe soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive by showing everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gotta be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge late surge\nAnd guess what they're saying that's what happened in two thousand sixteen\nHillary Clinton led Trump but fell sharply\nIf the polls are selling there's a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it then they start reporting it and they just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to cement it like the Kavanaugh trick backfires and these mobs are backfiring mayor not achieving their objectives\n[noise] so if you flipped this around and you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab Lee a tweet here is really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans they use this caravan which is so obviously a set up\nAs a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats to step up and be strong on border security we cannot once again be painted as a week and then lose [noise]\nThere's a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you Democrats have got to stop posing Trump just to oppose Trump\nSo here's a caravan here's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela sponsored and paid for it is if that if that's true\nThen Venezuela also means Iran and the ... folks\nA lot of people on our side have jumped St George Soros there may be but if it Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela that's also Iran and the ... regardless\nWe have this mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates unless those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not where the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against it therefore ... he is saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us a mob of seven thousand ten thousand people starving engaged demanding to be let in that doesn't help us\nWhatever now do you say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] [noise] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave\nI ... don't misunderstand I don't know what's good I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but\nI I don't think that going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for the left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groups think narrative of the moment whatever it is\nBut it's more than that there's nothing happening in America right now that argue is electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in math there is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reserves to vote for the ball they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what\nHe's aboard he tweets is a is a bad guy here's whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these moms there's nothing that Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one I Believe are decent society is under siege every day are decent society\nStandard and good old normalcy is under assault everyday led by pop culture and left us in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media where under assault every day but they have not overturned that yeah they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality\nThat yeah they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal there's just nothing out there to me\nThat would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nAh I just don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the church or not\nYou know less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip this scenario what sense\nDoes it make for a conservative Republican the gum up the works here by sending a bunch of bombs that are not going to go off and they're going to be discovered\nDoesn't make any sense\nAny way

so easy this is so not a controversy this is such a microcosm of this is ... is such a teachable moment this is exactly why the Americans left and the media have no idea who Donald Trump is\nAnd they can't even relate to it here's a guy who does nothing but love America and that is something they can't relate to\nLoving America to them is old fashioned it's a bygone era in this era of globalism loving your country is fine but but it seems so old fashion\nAnd it's it's it's just past say it\nSo it's so foreign to these people they just there really isn't even a common ground with them\nOn that Donald Trump\nLet me share with the way my brother David tweeted on this yesterday and there's probably a good way to say and he said Trump believes in a strong exceptional America he's not a political scientist\nHe doesn't speak even cold day he doesn't offer dog whistles you don't even know what this stuff is when he says I'm a nationalist he's not winking\nAt neo Nazis he's not winking at white supremacists and saying we're paid three ups and UPC people like he's just a guy who loves America he's a nationalist versus a global\nIs\nHe's going to make America great again he believes American deserves to be great he believes in America we the world when it's great\nPeople aren't but they're supposedly the intellectuals there the broad minded they're so small minded and tiny minded that they can't get past their hatred rooted in partisanship and all they had his knee jerk reaction Trump is a nationalist they immediately hear it\nIt can't get past their hatred rooted in partisanship and all they had his knee jerk reactions on Trump's has is a nationalist they immediately hear a dog whistle\nYeah Trump's talking to the people in Charlottesville that's what they're thinking that Trump is winking at the people in Charlottesville at not just let you go guys you go that's they honestly think\nAnd if they don't honestly think that they're doing it doubled disservice because they're trying to make people to follow them believe they do think that if they do think that they're the ones I have an electoral problems if they do think if they cannot understand the simplicity\nOf I Love America I Want America to be the best it can be America the best it can be makes the world the best if give if they don't understand that\nIf that doesn't compute with them then they have no business being positions of power in this country because they're not going to accurately represent us or this nation's interest because this is not complicated\nIt is such a cheap lazy reaction to say\nThe the Trump Hitler nationalist dog\nWhistle there's no basis in fact for it there's still\nEngaged in trying to convince Trump or are they convince people to hate Trump the way they do\nI'm just going to tell you people\n... ... if you don't learn to understand this you're going to ever be ... at the guy's ankles\nLoves America\nThinks America is great and can beat grader and a great America is great for everybody in it at a great America is made great by great\nCitizens and that there's nothing wrong with loving America there's nothing wrong with thinking America is exceptional and exceptional America solve the problems of the world and exceptional America creates an economy that is capable\nOf providing prosperity for hundreds of millions of people there is another form of government that can even come close\nSocialism can't communism can't by definition at camp\nSocialism communism produced wealth for the leaders by feeling it from the people that created and that's\nYour Obama's and your Hillary's and pick any Democrat running for president and twenty twenty and a bunch of running for reelection this time around\nBut do you people not understand how absolutely ... seat lazy if is to say that a guy his simply trying to describe how he loves the country is a freaking Nazi\nYou really think people are going to sign up with that and agree with that when there is not a sin Taylor of the evidence\nYou guys are closer to Hitler nuts and Nazi ism national socialism is a leftist movement you guys have much more in common with Adolf Hitler and Donald Trump ever go to hope that it\nDidn't start it will be happy to finish it Rush Limbaugh AI read Mitt for\nJohn Gibson here President Trump defines leadership the first major tax
