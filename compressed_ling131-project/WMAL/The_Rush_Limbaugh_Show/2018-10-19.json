I think many of the Republicans have bought the idea that Trump was going to be a garner a before and now\nI I they are so convinced the media will get rid of whoever the media targets I I think ... ... per se is certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him because they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd it it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the ... the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected [noise]\nAnd it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side\nBut we'll see if this story on the caravan turning around palm pay or is there a palm pale left Saudi Arabia after having met when king sol mom and Mohammed bin saw him on the crown prince either floated may call\nAnd\nThey have to know the Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message ... talk so he got one report for may be that the caravan has turned around\nNow if that's true whoever is paying for this is gonna have to keep paying for those people that go wherever they go next are they going to go back to Honduras by going to go back to Guatemala are not going to go to holding places in weight\nTo try to do they care about all over are they going to try to sneak them in in smaller groups rather than as part of this gigantic mob only time will tell thanks again Todd this is Jeremy in Mayfield, Kentucky you our next on open line friday Hi\nThanks for taking my call Russian my coming in loud and clear\nYou are sir here you're just fine thanks it's a sixty dollar Samsung showing you know whatever but uh yeah you know we\nAll have our obstacles to barren wives and here's your overcoming it was pretty well I hear you pretty well they keep\nUh you know I'm a Trump voted for Trump Madden Trump voter and America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in context when my question here\nHow can the United states the allies with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel is attacked us in the past like a useless liberty with all of unfair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudi side yeah the or is it the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted him back on harmed we said screw you you know where your benefactor spy on us and they said yes we know\nAnd we're going to continue the spike is we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd ah particularly when Democrats are in the White House and that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that if it was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William F luckily junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up and I remember him getting frustrated with me about it [laughter] so what does it ever doing anything with a litter stand the Saudi\nGovernment supposedly is an ally and yet these hijackers come from Saudi Arabia or you are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind this I said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi of the Saudi royal family to Islam\nAnd that's what I started asking experts are at at one of the people I talked to was anti McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shake case\nAnd it was ending who said that he's\nManhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shake case\nAnd it was ending who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out to being a radical inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he found out none of this is made up this this this all for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the car on if you read it\nRight this is exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he\nHe told me was so when\nYou realize that the Saudi royal family\nIs\nIn charge of world wide Islam because the holy sites are in their mecca and Medina Medina\nI found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam while in Saudi Arabia the branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and\nBeing understood terrorist Islam comes from ... from those you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence\n... hobby Islam is aware of the really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming anybody they can into their mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family\nStood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating you don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted while hobby is\nAnd that's what I went back to Mr Buckley aside I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers\n[laughter] well that's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin ... Mont\nMohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him he wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely\nDependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out he wants other people investing other industries individuals' investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars are Petro dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley than the typical places in other countries as well\nAnd part and parcel of his reform is the word abandonment orange me a distance thing for more habits of\n\nAccording to have been selmont Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is\nStill the branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to your show gay again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca Medina they do not want ... watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... among represents a bit of that that's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nWithin ...\nThis has brought to a screeching and now there's this story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wonder well who determines these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives saw Saudi kingdom could have twenty sons\nHow does he determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they had a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines\nThe winning edge of the crown prince the air's end in what order\nThen saw mom Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current\nKing Solomon\nWas chosen largely because of his ...\nThe oldest son of the current king\nSolomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says if the widow if it's true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin and saw him on as crown prince\nKnow many people think that this was up to the king the king determines what your his son just got to be the next king but it's not the case\nOffice sexual then the interceding don't miss this one's a lifetime big savings opportunity living cream stores\n... warehouse clearing the ban locations in Maryland and Virginia we are the\nBig screen door we are the big screen back for a period our prices ...
