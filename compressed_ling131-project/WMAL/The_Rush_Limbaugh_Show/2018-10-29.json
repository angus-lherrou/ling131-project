Trump a message to the ballot box by voting against him and the G O P after reporting\nOn the anti Semitic hate crime in Pittsburgh NBC shifted over to complaining about Trump for not bowing to the man's hatred\nOn Saturday he continued with his mid term campaign commitments despite the tragedy traded willing guys the anchor\nWhile White House correspondent Kelly O'Donnell Huston and on about how the president's response to the tragedy has been just speak extensively about all aspects of it while not giving up his so Trump's most\nOf the stop his campaign comes most to stop at rallies comp

you don't count me I'm telling you they're all they are relying\nOn their belief that you are is set up a Trump is they are\nAnd it you mean it and you've been fed up to the Trump was elected as you really didn't mean to vote for him and you've regretted it ever since from the first Trump's travel ban you wish you can have your vote back\nSo here they are if Americans\nAre fed up and mean they'll vote against Trump Trump should seize this campaigning you should stop as his unseemly\nABC News Trump at the center\nOf all the political violence right now that was George Stephanopoulos on the week

because\nI just I Want to get my voice out there and change because I don't like the way I mean Trump is making America great you know I Believe that but what about\nIf someone gets in office after him and then I go in there Twenty years later it's maybe going to be a huge mess because of the way America's millennials are going like my sister and I just want to be one of those who gets up there and says\nI'm done with this I Want to change it for\nGood for you um there are a lot of people a lot of parents who have kids your age and younger\nWho are really scared about the future of the country has always been the case for my whole life I have heard people say throughout my life but they don't want to have kids who wouldn't dare want to bring kids into this world that some I remember hearing that when I was Fifteen myself so it's nothing really really knew\nWhat I'm seeing today when people say there's a people who have kids not so much donors thinking about people who have kids are really really worried about their futures\nBecause of the way the west\nHas become more radical and more anti\nThe general concepts of America it's scaring people what kind the country or their kids\nGoing to grow into I mean there's always going to be an American about what's going to be are they going to be free are they going to have to conform to some of this extreme wacko left them in order to not be hassled build up their lives there some genuine fear about is if you want to tackle bad\nFor power to you and journalism needs people like you image\nAnd I don't like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America where\nThere's just a bunch of people that don't even belong in this country hurting and citizens going around trying to do bad stuff too I don't want to grow up in a country where you can't even have a gun to protect yourself or to last for\nA country where veterans are put behind illegals I mean I just I that's the one that makes me so angry as they\nDo you think that's happening why do you think so much attention as being lavish son of\nThe people you referred to as illegals coming here who are not citizens\nBut just being a granted access to so many things given so much why do you think is happening\n[noise] ah well there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama made it all just come away and you know um but I think it's just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's gonna stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop them this\nDon't know I understand why there ... why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are ...\nUnderstand why there a couple of why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wanting them here and and and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting in why do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal aspect of this\nI don't know for a lot of people who are voting they don't know anything about why [noise] I don't know where to stop why would they ah\nI don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them five I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken\nWell you know America has to help their people to they can't just give away money to the illegal coming and they're like well that they may bring jobs here\nHow are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're going to go work in agriculture cut agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegal that live in California and there's a lot around where I left but\nI don't know the answer is that they worked cheap number one for the people don't want the river cheap labor cheap labor is the answer the other side of it are you you're talking about the people that don't want to give them the money the people who are behind these policies are damn wells making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be giving layers\nBut the answer the answer to the question is because the left wants\nPower and power to them is more and more people incapable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves\nAnd the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor ill educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language\nFlooding the southern border you get 'em in their human beings we're a compassionate country they have to be fed they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they want to get these people registered to vote as quickly as they can they looking at him purely and simply as voters it's not about\nCompassion and it's not about giving them a good life it's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating let me put it this way rarely\nThe Democratic party and do not doubt me on this I knew when you do your research or journalism career you will find that this is the case of the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf uneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economic self alive because they can't speak the language\nBecause they don't have any education does our prime democratic voters\nThose are the exact kinds of people to Democrats want to build a majority around because they will be for ever grateful I eat dependent on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's\nThat's the reason behind that nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just undocumented Democrats it's not their undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that's their status right now and the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and to take care of them\nGive them health care make their track here make their trip pure worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for now some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves some are going to get here and I'm going to run rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite competent\nBut those are going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I just really hideous I get that gets it gets really hideous think of Democrats what people need people\nWho are incapable of self reliance and that's not helping those people have all that is not compassionate\nDemocrats want you to think that's all they are and they are none of it it's the exact about they're using these people and hoping that they never amount to much hey don't have much faith in them anyway but they are great voters great dependent voters in their\nBuys so that's what this is about look I'm I'm Glad you called rarely you are exceptionally well spoken your home

and privilege as it is to speak with you today thank you very much\nI just wanted to make a couple additional observations about the ABC News reporting on the synagogue shootings yes now I I normally watch Fox News but I always try to watch a network program every day just so I can legitimately compare the two\nSo I'm the ABC News reporting they quoted a study showing a rise in anti Semitism in this country now when they set this neither my wife and where I could remember there ever recording this before even after the\nFarrah Khan turned my comments I'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this winter weather and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might make that because of their fears about what might happen on my own thoughts were about armed security for these\nYou know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more intrusive may never worried\nI'm about arms security for\nThese you know they never have that fear about if you keep getting government bigger and bigger and bigger and more and more interesting they never worry about where is this going to end\nMade up out of whole cloth news stories literally made up\nAll to advance advance the agenda of essentially canceling the election results from two thousand sixteen and finding a way to get Donald Trump out of office and it was to people\nDemocrats Republicans moderates independents never Trump or is on the conservative side the whole of the Washington establishment so\nHere we are two weeks before the midterm elections the Democrats [noise] don't\nHave to win it\nHave told everybody that the American people are tired at Trump and they want to get rid of it and they realize their mistake they've been telling everybody there's going to be a blue wave gets a fate accompli Nate Silver eighty five percent chance\nTwo weeks out a bunch of bombs started showing up\nIn places that the media can say that they are being received by Trump targets I'm Sorry\nI didn't fall off the turnip truck ever and certainly not yesterday and the world of October surprises coupled with all the other realities I just expose and I think it only makes sense to be\nSuspicious and demanding of proof for whatever worm we're going to be taught\nPrecisely because everything's been so politicized everything now is being reported with in the context of how can it hurt Trump how does it hurt ... does it hurt and it\nHappened we obvious that people now back to the phones we go to stand point Idaho Casey graduated high\nHigh rests players speaking with you today you bet great to have you here\nThank you I wanted to refresh my memory them back in two thousand six team in Philadelphia at the Democratic convention\nWere first day there were no American flags president there but there was a Palestinian Craig president inside while outside they were burning Israeli flag and American flag\nHillary Clinton did not condemn this to the point Donald Trump came out and black that her for not condoning it immediately so what side to side environment [noise]\n[noise] yeah I Know I mean you can say this is my ... you can cite examples like this all day long that are part of her ignored or not even referenced at all\nIt is is a a a clear one way street and\nIf there are every extreme is on the left that the media makes a great effort to disassociate them from the main stream of\nThe Democratic party which they ah they aren't but see we can we can spend the whole day recounting instances from the past that point out the hypocrisy\nOf all that's being said about Republicans and tromp over these two ends of the the the fact remains here that despite\nEverything the media is hell bent on politicizing this or anything that will assist them in creating an anti Trump send them a heading into the germs and that's how they first report these things like I say that this tragedy hit the synagogue and scroll hill\nSection of Pittsburgh [noise] I mean after reporting\nAs many of the details those were known men were often it right\nOn how Trump was responsive and how Trump may benefit or may get hurt by this and we hope that the changes people's minds as they head to the balls in a couple of weeks or what have we can't help themselves hey if you rely on a computer for any\nReason you what you have to take precautions to protect what's on it
