network kicks off for yet another three hour excursion again with to broadcast [noise]\nTelephone number if you want to join us eight hundred new ways to to ha let me ask you a question how long has the media\nIn telling us that it's only a question if\nSomething happens that'll make Donald\nTrump self destruct they've been telling us this since prior to the presidential election they've been telling us since the campaign Trump came down the escalator three years ago June of two thousand Fifteen\nThe media has been telling it ... noted experts in the Washington establishment have been telling us that it's Trump just got a self destruct\nSomething's gonna happen a drug is going to blow up and everybody's going to see who the real Trump is and everybody's going to be shocked and surprised and saddened and then everybody's going to want Trump's swept away but it never happens\nIt never happens in dead [laughter] we keep watching his his critics self destruct Trump's opponents\nMelt down now practically every day over the fact that Trump is a melting down they melt down over to the fact that they can't make Trump melt down\n\nWages example Pocahontas herself you want to talk about melting down and self destruction you are looking at it\nElizabeth Warren you don't want I think I think there are there are four women we hear that attempted essentially an October surprise against Donald Trump but they've all bummed out where to Hillary Dianne Feinstein focus on us\nAnd who's the author there's there's one other woman they mounted things these are in October and all of these I think we're destined to to to destroy Trump\nAnd by extension the Republicans of course Dianne Feinstein running the balls e forward scandal\nAs an October surprise a Hillary Clinton in ... and her constant a needle and prodding out there she's got something planned it always has habit it always blows up on her face and now Elizabeth Warren\nThe U.S never had even six million vacant jobs open until April of two thousand Seventeen now we have an historic seven point one million jobs open\nThat means employers are looking to hire that many people\nThat you will say roaring economy that equals no problem getting a job if you want one\nWith that many job openings it is an employee ease market if there's that much demand for employees the employers can\nSet the terms based on their level of expertise that experience or whatever it is they're applying\nFor none of this in the world of common sense suggests that people would be unhappy by or about it and want to reject it and yet that thing ... what we're being told\nThat the American people are sick and tired day hey Trump they despise Trump they're embarrassed by Trump they were various by their vote and yet\nThere isn't a pivotal Lincoln bits of evidence that people have turned around and want to vote Democrat including two thousand six game presidential election\n\nFor those of you shouting at me why but we're we're storing food so we won the popular vote by three but yeah but\nTwo things about that most of those votes came from California the second thing is that we had a story yesterday that there are three and a half million\nRegistered voters above the number of bodies in America about orders are three and a half million more registered voters then there are voters\nWhich means there's all kinds of fraud\nPotential fraud ticket but even if those two things throw them out it doesn't it doesn't cancel a fact of the Democrats have been losing elections left and right now we have they couldn't stop Kavanaugh every October surprise if they tried to mount has blown up in their face and Elizabeth Warren is just the latest one and this one is a giant self immolation\nShe making an abject full of herself to add insult to enter in injury Stormy Daniels defamation lawsuit of Trump has been thrown out the prostitute is going to pay Trump\nShe has been forced to pay his legal fees the judge threw it out on the basis that it was a bogus\nLawsuit it had no merit a carnival Barker third rate porn lawyers creepy ever not a guy who some people were actually thinking could end up being the Democratic presidential nominee in twenty twenty\nI went through this you have to bear some prominent Republican analysts to really think that it could have I mean boggles the mind\nBut it's rooted in Trump patriot by the way it's I'm thinking of a lot it can be the Democrat nominee is rooted in being a never proper at any rate\nNo matter how you slice it in real life on the ground however you want him to permanent determine reality of defined it described as the Democratic party has not been winning elections and they have not been triumph and\nIn enterprises they have undertaken to persuade the American people to agree with them like Kevin all with Dr balls he formed\nAnd now Elizabeth Warren make no mistake they misread dislike you can't miss reading anything I'm short and Elizabeth Warren is the Democrats told yesterday or delivered that she's doing this three weeks out from the terms\nSo by their their live there live and that is blowing up in their face this was one of many poker surprises [noise] these people have been\n[noise] what's the word\nAll rationality to the extent that they ever have any has been raced Trump is driving them literally crazy they are acting talking behaving in ways so counterproductive they've lost their cool\nI'm sure that there are so obsessed so possessed Trump's hatred Trump's got to go that Elizabeth Warren I think probably the night before she released this news couldn't sleep so excited and this was gonna be the thing they got rid of Trump this was gonna be the thing that expose Trump for the fraud that he is\nEvery journalist in America has gone to band hoping to wake up with that news falling into their lab the next day for the last two and a half years let me take a quick break and we'll continue\nRush Limbaugh when the only only by word\nTalk hey folks you know about I drive the industry best in iCloud backup well they've created a new service called remote\nAnd what made that happen the Democrats attempt on Kavanaugh the Republican Mitch McConnell Mitch McConnell Trump brought him on stage at a rally in Kentucky Mitch McConnell got a hero's welcome Mitch McConnell got a standing up probably the first standing out in his career\nRelegate this program during the security has failed abysmally and just like the bill and Hillary stadium tour is going to fail abysmally\nThey're going to end up having to pay people to show up to get the kind of\nCrowds and the one that you may think Russia enough rabbit Democrats out there that will show up just to create the image that there's all kinds of interest folks you may think that\nWhat we're going to find out common sense will tell you\nHillary Clinton could withdraw fly just do a book selling party she couldn't draw applies to campaign appearance that's why she didn't do very many of them it would have been embarrassing how few people showed up but one's there were big crowds they did in fact bus people in\nThe country's not clamoring to hear from the Clintons companies not waiting\nWith bated breath for what they have to say but look I Want to I Want to return just for a brief moment to this this notion of the of the blue wave and go to a couple of audio soundbites Nate Silver this is the guru David analyst on the left\nWho used to be at the New York times and then he went to ESPN and then he went to five thirty eight and then he went to vox and back to five or five thirty eight is his company any took into various places\nAnd the Democrats the rank and file Democrats live and die by what Nate Silver tells them for example Nate Silver on election night two thousand sixty five PM gave Hillary Clinton and playing an eighty nine percent chance of being elected president\nSo they were all thinking it was over in the same thing is happening now Democrats Seventy three percent chance of retaking the house of representatives\nDemocratic voters breathing a huge sigh of relief Nate Silver is continuing report that he was on um the FiveThirtyEight dot com politics podcast and the host was Jody\n... who is a guy\nAnd the question has the gender gap increased since\nCabinet a lot of takes on Kavanaugh on the effect that he had are drawn by like male pundits who are in almost social\nNetworks right especially for Republicans where the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male journalists are pretty male has hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit of improved\nAfter the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin I Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the Kavanaugh nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats and all these\nHouse races the Democrats are assuring their voters are locks\nThey're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of 'em that are too close to call this isn't in the bag for them but they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blow away business for so long that if they come off of them even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten Brock Obama being done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen\nThey continue to lose seats in two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they thought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up where the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama one\nWell didn't even get way and it wasn't on the ballot or the the um the ... in terms of in that year\nWe're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over\nThe systematic loss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency and the Democrats have the least amount of electrical power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\nHas provided the energy in the end but it is the ... and the Democrats\nThe comeback show up and re take everything they lost all the problem with that is the Democrats lost because Republicans won the Republican\nShowed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve ...\nAmerican voters showed up in droves in every one of those men terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve in two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else Democrat Party\nThat much worse bragging about\nSome of the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the standing to\nEnergize but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS at all the other scandals that came along Benghazi there was nothing that Obama was doing the economy it was a flat line if it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns to Mexican drug cartels in a backdoor way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it they did except they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component to that I was twelve so now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand in the Nineteen twenties has suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd a hatred for who Trump visits hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of its hatred for the way he behaves it's hatred for its hairstyle it's hatred because it'd be mean spirited and what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver are telling us Oscars this massive Democrat blue\nWave there is no trend that suggests Democrat blue wave\nPlus Trump is you ... the Republican Party has one more Nate Silver bite here from the same pod cast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual we're all so I always says what are in the eighty ... eighty twenty zone\nIn both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there's a forty percent chance\nThat one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater almost to toss that you'll have one of these forecasts going around like this for you\nLet me translate this\nThis guy is nervous as he can be he's sweating bullets there's a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's admitting he's never seen a sport like this he's talking about Democrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate he's never seen anything like that you know I don't know how to do this\nAnd we consider it a toss up if it's forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's tell I guess he has a good idea what's going to happen this election and he's very nervous over to the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's\nGoing to happen here now he didn't want to come out and say it that way you need to have the talent the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns when they start throwing their numbers around\nAnd their percentages and stuff [noise] but let me just go for this very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever have a split in the forecast like those pretty unusual yeah a\nLot of things are unusual this time aren't they need to be an unusual since two thousand sixteen hasn't it to predict is likelihood of a split as unusual we um you know I always say uh when we're in the eighty twenty zone\nAnd we're now in the eighties when he's on in both places that makes me nervous meaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when the house\nAnd makes me nervous eighty twenty that's as close to ... I mean it makes me nervous we're now in the eighty twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't when the house which means it like there is a forty percent chance that one of those two British is going to be wrong [laughter]\nWell there is a pretty good indication that Democrats are not going to win the Senate and he's saying its impact we don't win a Senate ah when how\nHe doesn't know he's nervous his analysts\nSit telling if it's eighty twenty both sides but they don't know it's fifty fifty fifty fifty you might not even show up and go to work books at all all of your analysis and all your data collection produces it can go either way then why is anybody paying you\nRush Limbaugh going the way I met for\nWashington Mall W and Washington come talk\n\nOn that word and this is listening\nDay to reach and maintain your goals need guidance for longer with them you'll pay another hefty fee not here research then call compass at eight hundred Seventy five to eight one fear free consultation or go to cut this out last dot com\nOh I'm Don Rosenberg I lost my son drew when he was killed by someone in the country illegally non cities and states are giving sanctuary to more of an illegal alien from danger in handcuffs\nPopulation stabilization WMA eleven would rich W a male Washington\n...
