I'm assuming there's someone listening this afternoon it's going to retire and the next couple of years as you get closer and closer you want to line up your Social Security statement\nWith your retire excuse me with your investment allocation and you actually want to coordinate the two together and figure out how would you take advantage if the market went down also how would you take advantage of the market went up\nAnd so that no matter what happens you're maximizing Social Security and you're the SP for example and other words you're decreasing your last opportunity cost hold on our\nHands on do we need to be with our different investments in the investments inside our T s\nP do we need to be messing with all the time\nSo I think he really should be hands on when it comes to your finances you should be hands on but I Want you to put your hands in a different place\nIn other words the instead of deciding what buttons to press as it relates to your T. S. P. you know should you ms money to see us and I should you moved out to G. N. F. so did you change your allocation what is your risk tolerance what is the market going to do\nHow is the latest tweet gonna impact your money in your retirement it's so easy to focus their right in the in the consumer in the consumer environment that we live and where we're fed news were fed ... headlines we one instant gratification and many instances\nWe should take pause and we should shift our focus to\nTaking notes taking notes we don't want to press buttons\nWe don't want to time the market an impossible task if someone learned how to time the market then we would stop doing the show we would all time to mark it perfectly we'd all have great retirements it'd be kind of like winning the lottery over and over again but since no one knows how to time the market let's not pressing the buttons right now\nInstead let's just do what we're supposed to do\nBut maybe it gives us pause when everything's going great sometimes it's hard to be disciplined it's hard to make good decisions\nWell when things are going so well sometimes it's\nSometimes it's hard to be disciplined it's hard to make good decisions\nWell when things are going so well sometimes it's a time for reflection I mean that's what happens in my life when I fail it something I take a step back and I reevaluated so maybe when the market's going down it gives us pause to step back\nRight in a perfect world in it in a textbook world which none of us ever live\nFive to seven years out we would start incrementally shifting all of those accumulation strategies that have worked for you towards the distribution strategy in retirement right we are building the groundwork towards retirement income plan\nSo that's the that's the easy answer John five to seven years out ... what does the person whose life doesn't follow textbook like mine [noise]\nWell they likely find themselves in a place closer to retirement than five to seven years\nTwo years three or six months well then you need to start your distribution planning right now in your retirement income planning and you need to think about your pension projection what you're going to do with Medicare and your federal health insurance tiger and a handle your Social Security was going to be a good withdrawal strategy for you how do you deal with market volatility\nAnd that's what real retirement planning means and I think for breakfast and although he is Fifteen sometime in the next ten years he'll have his first job probably before then\nAnd so he'll be doing some retirement planning to he might not even know it maybe he'll start a four one K. and he'll say than to it so that would be doing retirement planning but that's not\nQuote unquote real retirement planning that's retirement planning in the abstract what I'm Talking about now is taking what has been abstract for so long the accumulation of pension credits the accumulation of Social Security credits the accumulation of T S P your retirement planning and

to spend down that nest egg and how to how to do this in a strategic way\nOr I'm going to say Seager Jennifer okay\nLet me tell you figure this is just between you and me and everyone who's listening this afternoon I Am to spend or in my household [laughter] oh All right and the spender and it's my parents' fault\nHonestly and it's not because they were spenders it was because they were worried that I Would never spend so when I was a kid or you're not even gonna believe the story\nWhen I was it gets I grew up on a farm in Indiana ... my parents were grain farmers and so the work ethic was you always work yeah it doesn't matter how old you are you're always work never arrest and so in the summers I was on the rock crew the ...\nCrew okay I Know it sounds provocative it is not [laughter] what that means is that there's an adult driving a tractor with a trailer behind it and me and my friends my friends fellow very easily so there's this big rotation in me\nThat we would walk through the fields and we would pick up the rocks that could damage the farm equipment and we put it on the trailer Mm yeah glamorous work you're right it's\nGlamorous work it actually stinks yeah I don't know I don't know if you're let's say if you've ever walk through a field and picked up rocks for summer\nI'm highly doubtful because I found out this was not a normal thing like after the facts right and we we we go through a childhood and sometimes we're like gosh our parents are so smart like how did they figure this stuff out and then you realize after the fact that maybe some of your experiences are unique to your family [laughter]\nAnd so in this case the rocker who is very unique to my family and I found out\nThat farmers don't pick up rocks out of their fields that their equipment can handle it it's actually built to plow through Iraq\nRight that it will be okay but the really the secondary intentioned at my parents' other than that I was learned a work ethic was that we put the rocks around our pond\nRight so I don't know what it's like in different parts of the country but an Indiana everybody has a pond yeah like who needs a poll you have plenty of space and you can just dig out a hole in the ground and so then you put rocks around the edge of the pond to keep it what's it called a ...\nRight yeah 'cause you could prevent erosion yeah\nMost normal families I learned after the fact they have a company come in and put rocks around the pond but in our family it was three summers of the rock crew and we had rocks around the entire pond\nMen and put rocks around the pond but in our family it was three summers of the rock crew\nAnd we had rocks around the entire pond so here's the moral of ... I got paid a dollar an hour while I was on the rock crow oh wow and man I work so hard for that money I mean really hard for the money sweat equity went into this so I was I didn't want to spend it\nI didn't want I'd worked so hard for the money I mean I literally walk through fields\nTo get the money that had them I say it was kind of they want to spend it so one day mom says hey and whenever we need to talk when you talk I'm like okay and I\nGo through my mental rolodex like why did I did what did I Do [laughter] I tracked like school days outside of school I\nCouldn't think of anything I've done wrong so I'm listening and she says well then are worried about you I'm like okay and she said yeah we're worried that you'll never spend your money\nAnd she said so we would like you know whether you put all the money the ... crew and you're in the bank and we're proud of you for that don't guess Ron we're proud of you but we really think that you should reward yourself you need to buy something you need to learn\nHow to spend more of the story I ended up with the Janet Jackson city [laughter]\nRight in a written nation yep no doubt case yes because we had one story in town and it was a small town of Kmart at the end of the street about two miles down the line and they had they were selling the Jim Jackson CD so I bought it for twenty dollars or Fifteen or whatever it was so\nComes back you know what so many people that I Need an old do not have worked in a ... a rock crew I can tell you the federal employees have held to retire none have ever told the rock crew story\nTo me from their own experience but what they have expressed is the fact that they've worked hard for their money\nThat they've been diligent about saving it they've been frugal that in a lot of ways the reason why they're in a good position for retirement is because they didn't spend too much they lived within their means and so that ethic that I learned on the farm\nA lot of federal employees I may have that same ethic and it's put them in a really good position but\nI worry about them in the same way that my parents worried about me\nHow well they know how to spend it if they're good financial position was built off of knowing how to save then how can we teach them to spend and still feel like they're being responsible\nAnd so for me that's purpose that purpose because we get into routines we learn to save into the CSP an ad catch up\nWe learn how to grow our money and the right allocation um for our preferences and we hang in there and federal service to be eligible for pension and Social Security but you know mom was worried about me because she knew that I wouldn't be happy if I just had money in the bank\nThat if I was just working my butt off and I had money in the bank\nI wouldn't be fulfilled I Would never get the reward and so people save another ts fees for retirement\nThat's abstract they saving ever been to the CSP for financial independence\nTo not work and not worry about money to go and more trips to spend more time with the grandkids to live the quality of life to be rewarded for what's been accomplished in federal service so in some very weird way it's like my experience with Iraq crew\nAnd so I encourage people to do is shift the accumulation thinking\nAnd start thinking about how you're going to use your money effectively you might even be able to buy agenda Jackson CD\n[noise] [laughter] well you can find out if you can get that Janet Jackson's CD or anything else on your retirement bucket list by calling ... eight five zero

here's the thing taxes apart allies and we don't want to avoid paying our fair share\nBut we don't have a more than that so is there a way to avoid having such a big hit\nThere are ways our strategic ways to avoid having a big hit we can't avoid paying taxes we do need to pay their fair share but we can be very strategic about how we pay taxes for example that reminds me of a a couple that we're currently working with that lives in Leesburg, Virginia\nThey're one of the highest not worth couples we've ever met with with almost ten million dollars in investments\nAnd they have an investment advisor that they're working with but not someone who can really help them with their retirement income in other words\nTheir distribution plant and getting that money out this person is from is really help them grow it but growing their retirement dollars and getting those dollars out and distributed to them over the rest of their life as a whole different type of basically retirement income plan\nSo they said you know what they were really happy with our current investment advisor he's done well for us but one thing we don't have as a distribution plan and the other thing that didn't they didn't have was tax planning when it came to their investments in other words strategic\nTax planning as to which accounts should they tap first\nShould they start the Ross conversion process and

Twenty one trillion dollars and we believe one of the big ways to kind of conquered the debt is to raise taxes\nAnd there are so low right now they've got to go up from here I'm sure\nRight if you asked you know a hundred people do you think taxes will be hiring the future or lower I bet you Ninety five out of a hundred would say higher\nYeah I mean things are really good now across the board you know with the stock market in general ... and everything but I mean everybody knows things don't stay good like that for too long and getting to that point yeah\nSo you don't want to assume you'll be in a lower tax bracket and retirement number one you stop working you stop max and got your accounts your mortgage and houses probably paid off you've lost interest adoption the kids are probably out of the home assuming you'll be in a lower tax rock and retirement is a big mess and mistake\nBecause a lot of our clients have more income in retirement than I Do when they work\nAnother mistake is not taking advantage of tax free accounts one week unsafe so Roth IRAs raw four one K. is Ross to US peace when you have the chance and you're able to contribute types of ... you want to do so because all the money is that you put in\nOr after tax which means they can be totally distributed to you in retirement tax free free of taxation and there are no armed news on those types of accounts like a ...\nIt's not that it's overly complicated it's just that there's so many things to consider and a lot of people don't know about you know you don't know what you don't know yet and I sit down and meet with a professional like a he's going to make you aware of all these strategies that you can use to better way you're currently at\nThere's probably no better time and tax history to be
