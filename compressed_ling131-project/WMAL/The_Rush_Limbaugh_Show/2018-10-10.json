wind gusts are the ... the highest\nWind gust right now around sixty four sixty five miles an hour in the Panama City Panama City beach area these one hundred and fifty mile an hour winds are in the Iowa poll they are not the entire storm\nA I I'm not trying to to to minimize the impact here it's just that the reporting on these storms\nAnd the education on these storms in general is I think one thing it's lacking such as the way they colorized the graphics of these storms to make it look like hell on earth when any any hurricane the strongest when as are in the eye wall and a little\nExtended from it\nBut there's not too many places are going to get a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds today wherever the wall hits and maybe twenty miles depending on the size of the I Will not from there it'll fall off nothing nothing [laughter] I mean a hundred and twenty five is no slouch\nIf you think that you've experienced Seventy five mile an hour winds well it's not bad I couldn't either it's the effect of a hundred and fifty versus other Seventy five months is not twice\nWhen you're in it if there was a multiplier effect of massive wind speed so that if if the fast is the highest winds you've been in and Seventy five miles an hour and you think OK\nA cat for is going to double digits it won't it on the ground miles per hour it is but the impact of a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds versus Seventy five the just the destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four\nOr ... hundred and fifty miles an hour is dead serious that that's where the storm surge will be or the worst of it\nThe further you get from the eye of depending on the structure be the more the wind speed decreases the rainfall pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm but the devastating the worst wins of the storm\nAre only in the eye wall area and people can look at these storms and the graphics wow a hundred and fifty miles an hour winds all that's all I met a whole building it now it isn't not trying to downplay the or the damage I just I've learned all this uh we live in hurricane alley here\nAnd every time one of these things I moved here from Nineteen Ninety seven and I quickly became a consumer hurricane expert I became an expert in how to interpret and watch the media I became an expert in how to analyze the graphics that the years\nAnd I became an expert in where the actual worst damage of a hurricane is you do not want to get a direct hit\nEverybody well yeah of course Russia everybody knows that yeah but but outside the direct hit the damage or the strength of the of the hurricane diminishes quite a bit\nIt's always the direct hit that that is the most destructive and then it starts to decline as you get away from me I

how many women were actually and it tends to\nFly by wire you amazed\nI just keep hearing that the suburban women have completely left the Republican Party and that was the exact opposite of what I witnessed last night of the political\nMarket imagine you're surprised if you have you been buying into the idea that the women have Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a massage and all that and then you show up at a Trump rally and it's it's at least fifty percent women I can imagine it'd be a little boondoggle by that\nIt was I don't know if you got any feedback from any other the Trump rallies but you get feedback from but\nWhat about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were the husbands there 'cause you detect that men were husbands or are they um\n[noise] the guy that I was sitting next to brought his daughter [noise] they took a long night sleep springs thought her I was just amazed that I don't think that there's any massage any whatsoever of the

story first that has no backup and then we're going to run a second story to show a pattern\nBecause I remember that with Clarence Thomas other women came forward it showed a pattern and it helped us persuade people at Thomas was guilty and so we wanted to show a pattern of behavior with Kavanaugh a pattern\nA beat you couldn't even substantiate uh single allegation be it from both the Ford or be from Ramirez or from Adam ... client was already swept Nick\nI mean this is a flat out admitting yeah we made up a second story well didn't use those words but we wanted to show a pattern\nSo essentially they're saying we believe we can convince people that something happened just by writing a story a legit\nAnd of course their buddies intellectual gladly accept an allegation is fact and them act on it you know we needed to show a pattern here is a Christopher Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you're waited high\nHigh right very very cool to talk to you thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and wanting to get your thought you mentioned that's a little bit yesterday but with this novel as it is and with Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm\nI just get worried when the mind and they left and the accident and then fattening or if they begin to help people\nUm it just has made worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything ... cup stickers and our yard on our cars because we truly are the silent majority we're not out there\nShowing it I mean I've been to rally but um it gets hadn't really scared and worried because you can own living my day each day\nI'd certainly understandable you you mean you need your your your support for Trump is on wavering but you don't\nYou don't feel safe\nPublicly demonstrating that are showing it was basically right correct couldn't I don't blame you a bit\nThe only guy who worry me is if you said you were thinking about dropping support for Trump just to make oh no\n[laughter] no no no I just it it worries me when I'm\nWatching a lot of people are worried about this I'll tell you I think ... I think there are a lot of people like you who just don't want to call attention to themselves 'cause this is an insane group of people and they're showing a willingness to assault and the timid data intact anybody and you're right to think that violence is just around the corner\nAnd who wants to bring that on your point is that there are a lot of people like you who are going to vote but white Trump would want them to vote for him I ... for Republicans coming up in this election that nobody maybe counting\n[noise] yes um you know nobody's that sign in science and they aren't they everybody I talked to is a hundred percent ... though Trump and now they talk about it and it's almost like you know we went for about it like ... or ... or you don't have a ... oh\nIt's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were ...\nReally thought because they were afraid that the stakes that the regime was listening to him\nAnd so you're basically this driving describing the same thing the difference is that in in twenty sixteen there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump is it on the ballot leader so\nYou you there might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in charge but but your point is the outward support for Donald Trump is is being suppressed by people to not call attention to themselves for your\nConcern about violence to share it let it grabs not like number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul he was on Fox and friends today and uh it was only usually Earhart or should you have a big fear about this rhetoric your fear is if somebody is going to get killed\nSomeone almost did I was there at the ball field when Stevens police almost died from a very very angry violent man\nWho is inside and really by rhetoric on the left and this has been reported enough when he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to two hundred shots at our school shooting five people in almost killings things ... this is for health care he also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket\nWhen he was willing to kill so what happens when Democrats say get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really call them the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that of assassination is going to say what the Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask them to calm down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these people\nBut privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party wants America to think\nThat this in unhinged behavior is\nPretty natural pretty normal that it is representative of of a majority of American people like Democrats want that perception out there they want the anger and the un has behavior justified on the basis that Trump is so unacceptable Trump is so bad so dangerous so sick so whatever\nAnd there's a lot of reasons they're not going to tamp down there's a lot of reasons they're not going to distance themselves from it and there's a lot of reasons why they're not going to ask these people to back off a little to be more responsible\nThey don't think it would help them they think this kind of on the hinged I'm Sorry for not having a better word but I don't know better when\nHow many times can you call 'em insane or not right or mentally disease or what have you but regardless what you call them the Democrats think there's value in these people doing what they were doing in the Senate office building and confronting people in elevators and basically frightening the\nWhatever it takes what ever it takes to get\nDone what they need to get done so don't don't think that they're going to get a dose\nSensibility or responsibility and asked for it to be dialed back and part of it I think is that some of the Democrats themselves are afraid of on the leash and misbehavior on themselves\nWhen I'm not going to be said Russia ... worth\nAugust prices for peace building's only genetic code windows ... additional business owners rent or at least space including storage space
