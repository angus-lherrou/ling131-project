day to day\nYou you can see what the a narrative the top narratives are at a soap opera scripted the day seems today\nAt one of the overriding concerns among the drive by the president's relationship with Rod Rosenstein\nThe debate\nToday centers on whether or not Rosenstein was kidding or not in a meeting with other FBI officials when he suggested in wearing a wire the next time you wouldn't talk to the president\nWhat compounding this organ abusing people is that Trump is not fire Rosenstein in fact had Rosenstein up to the White House and men had him on air force one flew him around them got off the airplane with him so they have a good working relationship\nThe president's still will not declassify documents that Devon notice and a number of other people want deemed classified which would answer a whole bunch of questions about the soft coup and who really started it and when and where and all of that\nAnd the president and I talked to Rosenstein and frankly told Fox News today in the morning on the phone I've I I don't understand why he won't tell people I had a great conversation where there were some things he told me that need to be under\nOath so the drivers that can be because Trump doctor Rosenstein Rosenstein told Trump everything you wanted to know Trump says I don't see anything wrong with it but then Rosenstein will go up and talked to a congressman from making him do it so people can figure out what's going on let me tell you how to\nObserve this or how to deal with trust the Trump knows what he's doing here that's all I can tell you don't fall for the fact that Rosenstein playing Trump trust the fact that Trump knows what he's doing and just be patient\nHe arrested the elite of the elite\nOf Saudi well some of them even among the royal family and took over the Ritz Carlton hotel in Riyadh and that became a giant jail and he put all these guys in jail demanding a certain percentage\nOf their wealth on the basis they had stolen it\nDo the corruption and connections in ... he made a lot of enemies well Jamal ...\nHas as a journalist doesn't buy any of this and has been running around openly criticizing Mohammed bin some on\n\nRunning stories suggesting that Mohammed bin ... father ... king has grown so upset with his son the crown prince\nAnd the crown prince that he's\nTaking toys and power away from it this reportedly has not set well with the crown prince Mohammed bin selmont\nDespite some reforms in Saudi Arabia you still don't get to run around and criticizing the government and keep your head you don't get to run around and criticize the government and keep your knees for example\n... wanted to get married he had to get a wedding like a marriage license he was in Turkey\nIn order to do that by the end it before the hearing supposedly had been targeted by the crown prince and others in the Saudi royal family because of his open criticism of these reforms that other things so he goes into the Saudi consulate or embassy in Istanbul\nAnd hasn't been seen since\nHe went in to get a marriage license he was wearing get this he's wearing an apple watch his I found though was connected to watch was outside in the car with his fiance who was outside waiting on him to get his marriage license and come back out then they go off and live happily ever after at the same time you're among\n... shows up at the Saudi embassy or consulate it's down both Fifteen\nMan menacing type guys from Saudi Arabia arrive on the same day they are seen entering the same soul a Saudi consulate or embassy they are seen leaving a few hours after they arrive Jamal could show again has not been seen since\nThe theory is that he was killed and murdered and be headed in disfigured dismembered and taken out of there in various diplomatic pouches and will never be seen again\nThis is why the president others are being urged to get involved to find out what happened because we have an allied relationship with the Saudis on we cannot tolerate this if this is how the Saudis are going to treat their journalists\nNow the relationship we have a Saudi Arabia always has been very little leverage they've got oil we didn't have as much as we needed we needed to buy theirs we needed them to stay friends we needed them to have a a open ended the relationship with us as such we treated him with kid gloves we protected them they left the sub build a base\nA air force base we protected them it was kind of a mutual ... scratch\nA relationship but now it's changed because we don't need Saudi oil we have become the largest producer thanks to fracking of fossil fuels in the world and we have reserves that go beyond what even the Saudis have not been widely reported but it's true\nAnd so the pressure is now on to not couch out to the Saudis to find out what happened here to this journalist ... ...\n[noise] and if in fact he ends up\nHaving been murdered and dismembered and then and disposed of in various diplomatic pouches\nIt would not look good and for Mohammed bin Salman who really is he's he's got the world convinced that he's trying to reform the ... the the Saudi Arabia and oh there's another fundamental aspect the Saudi\nSaudi Arabian society has been governed by ... which is a very extreme it terrorist inspiring strain of Islam\nAnd by decree the royal family in Saudi Arabia is in charge of Islam\nSo it was with the apparent endorsement of ... that the Saudi royal family existence they run a mecca for example\nThe annual pilgrimage what Mohammed bin ... mom thirty two years old crown prince is it tempting as part of his reforms\nTo distance Saudi Arabia and the royal family from ...\nFrom militant very human terrorist inspiring Islam This has many other people upset these are the kinds of reforms that you never really expect to see in totalitarian and\nAutocratic countries like this but he's a millennial and\nIt's just the case that as generations come and go there's always going to be a generation coming up that will at some point refused to accept\nThe circumstances of the traditions of its parents and grandparents and he may represent that generation of Saudi Arabia but there are a lot of people rebelling against it don't want women to be able to drive there don't want women to be able to\nYou know associate go to the movies or knitting clubs or whatever they do they don't want to be able to do that without they don't want the male position to be weakened whatsoever\nAnd he didn't win any friends when they gathered all of the corrupt wealthy tycoons ... took over half of their wealth under the premise that their games were ill gotten he's made a lot of enemies but he's made a lot of friends to in the United states and in the u._k.\nIt made a lot

a shrinking economy\nHard nurses no let's not forget something for most of ... time in the last eight years prior to Trump\nPeople like you were also told that this was his but does it go and get that you had to work\nAnd acknowledge that there was a new normal now and that America's great days of the past may not have been totally legitimate and ended this this was more like the way it's going to be now you will also told not only were you on a flat line economy you weren't told don't have any lofty expectations here\nRight ... exactly how\nHow let's jump forward to this growing economy my next question are you actually there's no wrong answer here it's not a trick are you actually aware of a growing economy because you're living it and experiencing are only are you aware of it because you see economic numbers reported that say it's good\nI I'm In a small economy in Asheville North Carolina that is its own separate\nEconomy so I'm aware of it via\nInformation but I can I can feel it I can sense that I can I'm I Know that it's true that is that if I mean it's hard to build your life\nIf you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build a life\nAnd and I literally feel like the finances in America there's been a short ... hold on to this depletion of it I mean I'm old enough to remember\nSitting around the table and my parents

of it\nIt's because of poor management and our government that has the lead to all of this money out of our country and and people here are suffering and you talked about the opioid epidemic they can and and all of these you know these the fruit the fruit of having no work\nWhich he used to be just standard knowledge you knew that if there was a population of people that didn't have work they were going to have\nOf other problems exactly right but the point is you're\nYou're you're living economy or you're not just saying and thinking it's good because people are telling you you're actually experiencing it\nWell I Am experiencing it and I feel blessed and I feel grateful to the president because people want to act like oh well he was just given money well a lot of people win money on lottery and it's gone a year later oh hey real yeah\nOh that's a whole nother you're absolutely right that is a whole other subject watery lottery winners at all what\nBecomes of um the you're absolutely right I just I'm Glad to hear you say you're living it you're experiencing it manage real did you that it's not just the results of me or people like me telling you that things are good that matters\nJust one thing my mom also told me Christine they eat everything on my plate because there were people starving in China\nBut I was a smart ass I was a smart alec and I turned I tried to use logic on every example of parental discipline I could\nSo when my mom said that to me after a number of times and I got tired of hearing I said mom you telling me that if I eat everything on my
