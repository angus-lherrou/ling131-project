a long time that there hasn't been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now\nIs that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene points advantage of the American people will realize their mistake electing Trump or the Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argue against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason the two thousands actually in\nMidterms the

openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal aliens is going to be swept to a massive landslide\nWhen the American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice and are not asking for a political party\nTo stop paying attention to the border and let everybody who wants to in in the American people are not there the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\nDon't do your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you

had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority American people Donald Trump never\nGotten the Republican nomination if the\nPeople of this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump would have never gotten the nomination he's certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go up\nYou know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall\nThis proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want in let them yet and we should feed them we shouldn't house then they have nothing they're poor are coming from ... countries left them that's not a majority opinion of the United states\nThe media is going to try to make people think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people so I\nI none of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build the wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very subtly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan\nTrying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad guy

bought by and they're going to charge people to get Trump those encouraging but again and he's got they're going to charge fingerprint make money off this they're clearly picking back piggy backing off what Trump's doing and they want to get in on the action and they want to prove to themselves and the Democrats that they can draw crowds too\nAnd they aren't going to pay all there are not going to be Seventy five thousand people\nOn the action and they want to prove to themselves and the Democrats than they can draw crowds too and they aren't going to pay all there are not going to be

many times you're just saying this\nTell me\nTell me how many times have you [noise] it doesn't happen often\nI Know it is Miami and you're thinking Little Havana and all that\nBut I'm just telling you like the Democrats want to get in on me they're taking heat\nFor all of this garbage that they're doing they're taking heat on the way they did Kavanaugh they're taking heat for forcing Cruz and his wife and others out of restaurants nobody's in favor of that that's not getting any support what's not building a movement it may be sent to satisfy the already existing loan attacks\nThat make up the Democratic base but it's not growing it\nAnd so I think I wouldn't be surprised if the Democrats staged this whole thing to try to get sympathy for polo see much like all these attacks\nOn the turtle and his wife and Ted Cruz and all these other Republicans have been forced out like cures to Nielsen\nIt just reeks of copycat to me\nIt just reek like Bill and Hillary want to get in on the
