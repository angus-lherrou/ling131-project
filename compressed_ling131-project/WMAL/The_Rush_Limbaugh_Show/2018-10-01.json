L. or Washington comes to\nMy friends are Rush Limbaugh and\nThe execution of assigned hostilities flawlessly with zero mistakes\nAnd I'm going to make an executive programming format change rather than get to the Trump somebody's not 'cause I Can't squeeze 'em all in here we're going to get back to the phones now people that are waiting patiently for\nA long time anyway so we'll go back to Washington DC we'll glad you called sir what's happening\nBecause it's a pleasure to be here\nUm I work at your thoughts on on the ethical issues that go on to be paid if you recall during the doctor or testimony the prosecutor asked her how to pay for her legal fees are security on as you mentioned her primary page and those three pages of close to a million dollars\nAnd I happen to be some kind of ethical issue what you could just accuse somebody without any kind of cooperative evidence and then go public with that and raise you know that that amount of money as it is a very very properly thought if\nThere's a lot of weird offensive there for people to make you raise your basic triggered waves there are a lot of money or if you're crowding out or\nYour crowd outdoors and look this is a toughie uh in in a strict capitals sense she has identified a market and that is there are a range lunatics who want her to be right\nTo hope she's telling the truth they want her to continue to speak and tell them if they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw cabinet they're happy to pay for it this is how they can be involved in politics beyond voting there are more than having to pay it doesn't matter to them as she can afford her lawyers yourself\nIt doesn't matter to them that her lawyers aren't working pro bono because this is a political case\nSo she's identified a market there are people that want to support her with money so she starts the Gulf on me page I actually think somebody sent\nMe a note today that uh go fund me go find me is not new money laundering is essentially money laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were uh make us\nWhereas a lot of this money going to go a lot of this money is going to go to these two lawyers who are then going to be well they're already involved and Democrat Party politics so it's just it's a it's a new form of fundraising that's not call fundraising miss\nIs made to look like people supporting have big drag older and falsely accused a stressful\nReally in bad shape woman who can barely barely get through the hearing terrified they're happy to help\nAnd I you know this or that she's not the only one using it for ... there's a lot of Republicans organ that a lot of people who are using go fund me pay just to raise money for their legal bills and other expenses\nAnd if you can convince\nThe American people to support you\nWell I mean there's there's I don't think there's anything immediate that can be done to stop it and I don't think that you can join the conclusions about her from it\nUm in terms of whether she's being truthful or not or if you wanted to draw a conclusion that the Gulf ... pages I'm\nI'm a way to get Democrats suckers I. E. voters\nTo pay for this other doesn't cost people already have a lot of money and the thing then you could try to make that point that the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you Jeff in Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nRussia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea to have a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left as always be like bullies and they'll do anything and they've never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you know ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nEvery hour of every day exactly what Graham did make that the ongoing about putting them on the defensive make let media repeat these charges ... Graham laid out\nBut instead it was a standalone Graham said it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it\nIt was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican and solve grams impassioned allegation of the Democrats was followed by agreement\nJeff flakes\nTo me that the FBI being allowed to do one way to get there by not allowing fine\nSenator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs if you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're gonna have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to become the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past for some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated it and we shared it with ... way to go and it dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nLindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just has to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to\nWorry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the when did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care when they got a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys know they said they didn't Lincoln Mr German we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff\nThat they said they did oh what about an investigation huh well Tom ... says we're going to investigate Feinstein we're going to invest some of these other things that needs to be followed up on their needs to be follow through but I for one I Know investigations are nothing but I'm getting tired because all they are for the way\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible enters the mile\n\n... why is that so hard she didn't have any evidence that she made a credible witness how well she was really suffering and in may so\n\nNone of that stabbed Bush's credibility an attitude doesn't give us credibility pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering over something\nNow want to go back to my production [noise]\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out cabin on that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held up pay\nBecause voters are going to be fit to be tied up being led down again\nThen the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this gave up Republican voters are going to get some ticked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and they hate seeing what's happening in the capital and they don't want to management happening there on Ken they're going to show up in droves well I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\n\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just thinking about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting if Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh is not confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to be so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad you feel betrayed\nBecause if that happens take that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he is not confirmed in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin all were in the majority and we couldn't get him confirmed you need to come out in ... how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans that come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen Kavanaugh was not sworn in as everybody thinks that\nWhat voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness that Kavanaugh the dirty tricks and Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out\nThere were guaranteed to get their votes were going to there's going to be a Republican away because of what happened to Kevin Ball\nAnd then a Republican start campaigning and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in Europe majority\nWe know it's very small majority but you're the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work\nFolks my point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side are going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're going to show up and vote like they've never voted before but if that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\n\nThey keep working and voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump Trump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone will be able to\nTurn a cabinet to defeat and the turnout but the Republicans in the Senate and house I don't know how they do it\n[noise] ... vote for us Kavanaugh was defeated vote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nHear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout we have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing that since I've been doing this show\nSince I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here is that rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see house don't say really are you kidding we lose and it was hell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with Kevin Kevin on doesn't make it isn't gonna really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up the base\nThat doesn't make any sense to me you know what I mean the other way around this is another trick\nI think that gets played on Republicans your base is going to be really fire enough if Kavanaugh doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nYeah is is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell rush voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what the guy got railroad railroaded and our guys couldn't stop it and and we're supposed to say well okay\nMan we're really loaded now that's going to cause that turn up to ... I'm Sorry ... I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's gonna happen is that voters are going to be out there saying\nEven what we vote Republican Democrat still run down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep elected re it's got to be the other way you got to\nWin this we have got to be that Democrats not look to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of ah people who think their expert political analysts and they all\nWell not all but I mean a whole bunch of them have this theory that the way they get the base all fired up we want to let them destroy a great life great\nPatriot a great American his whole career his future maybe his family in order to win the midterms how does that work\n\nYour football team loses make you want to become a season ticket holder\nOr is it when they win if you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team why do we have to keep losing to fire up our base you're talking about a trap she asked me the media's behind that the Democrats a Washington establishment I got to take a break be back after\nPart of owning a premium appliance excite the them out I'll bet you didn't just shout the installation premium apply it to me kept him installation for that you need scale than expertise brain way that brand scars from cutting granted to modifying your cabinet trade are certified\nIn salaries are custom installation part for a while I've been filtering refrigerator cut the top you name it including brand like sub zero in loans\nFor custom installation track the railway Branson I Swear it doesn't cost more to get more\nRemodeling your kitchen doesn't have to be overwhelming ... brain scarred manager project from start to finish and get great deals now on the appliances to make it happen\nDouble rebates on electric you profile packages plus get free bonus appliances with select GE came on a grand purchases brand scarves kitchen remodeling experts do it all and they do it right from teaching designed and measure but all the way through installation remodeled your kitchen and bringing scar hurrying now or visit ... dot com\nDo you what I eleven would which do you I'm a a Washington\nShot one thousand dollar for time\nUntil you hear me now to me let's face it [noise]\nAnd they all news it too I'm a real nice at new this hour Republicans have made a decision on where there are a host the national convention and twenty twenty\nCharlotte North Carolina is where the Republican National convention will be held in twenty twenty party chairwoman Ron and make Daniel made the announcement today\nAnd says it will take place August twenty fourth through the twenty seventh Charlotte has hosting experience as the Democrats held their convention there and twenty twelve a divided Charlotte city council voted six the five in July to approve the bed\nTo host the Republican convention the mayor says she looks forward to showcasing her city I'm Kerry shoemaker\nPresident Trump is celebrating his latest revamp trade agreement with America's two neighbors and calling the pack for the United states Mexico and Canada the U.S MCAA\nThis landmark agreement will send cash in jobs pouring into the United states and into North America\nGood for Canada good from Mexico and set up jobs leaving for overseas they will be returning back home and we've already had\nThe president also asked today whether he thinks the FBI should interview Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh as part of its investigation\nI think it's fine if they do I don't know that's up to them I think that he spoke very conclusively and very well I think it's been a very rough period of time I guarantee that I had a period of time like this you can\nSee that entire news conference a double\nA parent a double your nail dot com starting today in Maryland new red flag gun laws go into effect\nPrior to today law enforcement really had no statutory authority to actually go into somewhere where the person may be and to remove firearms\nMontgomery County sheriff Darren Tompkins says the new law allows close friends and family to ask for an extreme risk protection order\nIt will allow these orders to be issued twenty four hours a day seven days a week ...\n... says the new law will save lives Barbara ...
