oh\nThirteen eighty one view on the hour every hour every day on Washington Mall Antonio Fort Washington comes to top [noise]\nLast night the ceremonial swearing and Brent Kavanaugh Supreme Court was their living room buzzing Ginsberg who will never mind\nHere she was a way [noise] um [noise] she's admitted that she shows up at the states of the union speech is having a little line\nTo get through the night that's why she esteem falling asleep at the courses is nothing wrong with that uh\nUh Atlantic Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean who way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard you lay the Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the court I I'm not sure that this is going to do the court any good\nA Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kevin O's replacing and here is the president of the United states we started hearing audio soundbites seven he is apologizing cabin on on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to bread and the entire cover all family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who step forward to serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this covers right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in you follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over\nEverybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping the fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin author openly promising to continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to nullify the power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this is one of the word over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I'm telling you folks this is crucial we don't I I Can't think of any former president would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles\nI Can't think of one who would do it and it's just as important but Trump do this and it was important when Trump at a rally explained to the American people what the American media has not told them\nThought [noise] but they don't ... folks\nWhat was the more effective persuasion will be it's always been my feeling on his thoughts\n[noise] but they don't ... folks we are not legitimate in their eyes\nIdeas are not legitimate our existence is not legitimate and not even worthy discussion or acknowledgement\n\nAnd they don't even look at the United states the way we do they don't accept the founding of the country the principles in our founding documents they accept none of that none of that is relevant to all of that is part of the discrimination\nThat was founded as part of this country as far as their concert\nAnd it was all on display in the catalog hearings everything that we are up against the absence a presumption of innocence cabinet was guilty because he's a conservative Kavanaugh was guilty not because they had any evidence cabinet was guilty because in their minds he's got no business being a judge\nAnd he's got no business being a judge because he's not one of them it's no more complicated than that how they get rid of him that's another story\nBut his image intimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely non just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring former and a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with\nThis and that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court\nThe rest of it the history onyx but child like wailing in immaturity is the result of the liberals socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way already suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another\nVideo and video of these kids on Saturday afternoon literally calling at the doors of the Supreme Court they get in to try to stop a real swearing in they were literally calling at the doors\nThere wasn't any humanity and this this was just raw hatred and fear\nCoupled with massive site disorders\nAll of it promoted not denounced all of it\nPromoted and encouraged by the powers that be and the media and the Democrat Party and the ...\nOf the left\nAs I've been saying what a decent people do in response to this decent people are we're we're not going to become them\n\nThey may have as an objective a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not dumped me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of us that are here on the periphery but do not doubt me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents goes right to beat them but we're not going to become who they are we don't have it again is to become who they are so given that how are they stop it's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... facto career and life political murder to stop things they don't\nWant to stop people if they don't want how do you how do you oppose them how to beat that back\nDo you do it with the city to do it with politeness do you do it with\nManners I'm Sorry I'm going to cut it sorry never Trump or his bought the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia trip but churches rock solve all the churches where in during the violent [noise] uh not anymore\nThe churches are like every other institutions sucking\nUp the people they hold power everybody needs\nMoney churches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things and you're going to do it this is happy to take a look at\nYour papa\nAnd what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places serious serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our\nWay of life underneath the umbrella of decency\nWe're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it\nUnderneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest levels of power in the country Donald Trump fear loosely pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it\nMedia is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are I mean their bodies accused the media being biased over the years\nBut nobody accuses them of fake making it up\nParticipating in the open and want to ruin a nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that and I'm not I mean we may hear but its highest levels that governs never had before there's Donald Trump doing it\nAnd from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night this really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\n\nWith that I must say that use are\nUnder historic scrutiny were\nProven innocent thank\nYou [laughter]\n[noise] Margaret\nAnalyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness and courage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is\nI'm Sorry never Trump or his but that's just pure class\nTo take the time to look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two young daughters\nOf breath and Ashley Kevin all your father is a great man every father wants to hear that every father loves having his children told him he was a great man few ever are afforded that\nOpportunity with Trump did it last night then\nProclaiming Kavanaugh's innocence I mean that is akin to taking all the poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee and every member of the media tried to ruin the capital\nTo openly proclaiming him innocent\nHe can't do that that was it according to last you know this isn't all but they had him guilty didn't say\nHe was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford and written a letter to die on science I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or is she was also a sewage\nBut somebody suggested she write that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates from the yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination or the Kavanaugh would pull out\nAnd they would never get as far as ... as it got\nVery was clearly\nIllustrator jihad no evidence no cooperation no nothing in their strategizing of this event they never thought of it go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull the nomination presidents don't want the grief starts reflect\nPoorly on them they go to the nomination look [noise]\nIt won't work nominate we can't sustain this you got to pull out nominees Assad damn it's my one sorry nominee I'm pulling my support nominee present get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah blah but he pulls out didn't happen here Trump refused pullout withdraw ghetto capital that's where they gummed up the works\nAnyway I got to

Pennsylvania and Michigan I'm telling you what's going on here they're seething with jealousy bill and Hillary on those rare moments where they're at home at the same time and together\nThey sit there

thought we were popular back at it now is that we can draw a crowd like this we ... we could have done that how we could have done it better jobs that you believe this we have and then they start

I'll\nGet right to the point I have one comment one question and comment is it's going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that the the president is teaching the Republicans how to fight I actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like a loose\nAnd I don't think anybody's pick it up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen it because I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media\nIf instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival\nAnd safety because I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like he's preparing for the Republicans to hold the Senate maybe even expand it or hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house\nIn numbers we haven't seen and who knows how like since Nineteen Ninety four and I'm Wondering what it says what if all of this is just a bunch Akaka\nMedia and and and polling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixty and that got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen his trumpet fifty one percent approval the CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling data the drive by trust shows them just even now after the Capitol hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\nAll right well as I say we're hypothetically pretending this is true what has Trump done to generate that\nKind of discussed other than be alive and be president what has he done no no I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm being serious what he wants it\nAlls certainly said he separated families at the border I'm Glad you reminded me of that\nIt's getting harder and harder to watch television shows what was I watching this this last week was premier awake for all of the new network prime time shows I think it was law and order and you yeah law and order and you're SUV or something and and\nUh the show started out focusing on a bad guy who had little kittens in his basement in a cage and the FDU\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and they don't\nKnow officer you know our government\nIs separating the two parents that are born or I don't see them\nAnd the cops we fought ever say oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watch this uh well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Adam so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nAnd it's to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated\nSo I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who\nAny under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a queen size zero because here's rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and the saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancel law and order and you're SUV I get rid of that has been out there a long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\nSo you really you think that\nTwo hundred nine Republican House seats coming up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating families [laughter] [noise]\n\nUh\nBut that wasn't explained to hundred night certainly says it's a lot of Republican retirements ... yeah committee chairman or retiring cause their term limited\n[noise] forty three members are retiring summer coming to Germany and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got attention get t._v. time\nYou know you matter but when your term limited out of your chairmanship when you quit and you're part of your time they're into big bucks in the private sector\nYeah there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred nine of them but my my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven retirements does not explaining not with the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't think it's policy will ... there were people if this is all true there has to be something or a series of things\nThat the American public is just fit to be tied over and want to take it all out of the Republicans was again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people's country hate Trump embarrassed in front but that's what they think\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump just isn't there in any even that even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval that's not in the twenties where George W\nIs Trump to it isn't fair in any even even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval that's not in the twenties where George W. Bush was where they drove him down and it was six year anyway uh let me take another obscene profit break we will continue after\nThat [noise] who endured the mainstream American media just gold rush but he I be men were\nSmall and now Washington\nComing to talk of President Trump and congressman Kevin McCarthy are working together to keep the Republican majority in Congress together we must protect the house that is giving you back your money with historic Mexico doing jobs was drunk or trade deals and your security with\nBorder enforcement and the Republican Congress is taking power and money from Washington and giving it back to you but Democrats think your money belongs to the government wants to raise taxes what types of criminals was things were cities and reverse the twenty sixteen election within feet but that's\nThe Democratic agenda and the only way to keep the the Democrats from raising taxes is to do your part vote for Republican Congress on Tuesday November ...
