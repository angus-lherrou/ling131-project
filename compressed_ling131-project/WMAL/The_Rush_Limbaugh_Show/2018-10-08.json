N. A. L. more Washington comes to talk [noise]\n\nDonald Trump was on wood judge Judy and Saturday Night after his rally and she asked him why he did\nThat why does he call out the fallacy of her testimony and this is what the president said\nAre a lot of things happening that orange crap they weren't true there were a lot of things that were left unsaid and I thought I had a even the playing field because it was very unfair to judge now I can very nicely if they just this cabinet are very unfair\nEven the playing field because there was very unfair to judge now I can very nicely if they just established are there was a very unfair situation though I even the playing field that once I did that it started this tale through they were very very unfairly\nThe Democrats have no guts the Democrats are a bunch of paper tigers and Democrats what Republicans walk all over\nNow how many of you think it's the exact opposite this is pretty common to there are a lot of people on both sides who think their own side as a bunch of\nHorses but I don't know how anybody paying attention on the left can think that their sights a bunch of voices but the fact that they do is fascinating to me\nNow here's another such pace and we have said that this woman once before I don't remember specifically when her name is Alexis Grinnell she has written on gender and politics for the New York daily news the Washington Post and other outlets [noise] she had a piece\nOn Saturday in New York Times it may have been actually published on Sunday and released on the Web on Saturday Night the dates October sex since I don't read the paper anymore I don't know when the stuff actually shows up in the print edition\nSo my guess is this thing was released Saturday Night on the Web to be published in the Sunday paper but it could have been under Saturday paper as well doesn't matter white women come get your people\n\nI I don't even know where women who is thoughts are this convoluted and you're going to hear\nI don't know why they come from I don't know who's responsible for creating the motive I think it's gender studies I think it's a combination of feminism and gender studies\nThat\nLiterally corrupt young minds in fact there is a there's a there's another link the peace [noise] today\nThat describes a hoax three self described left us\nRan on active duty him in a nutshell three academics self described left wing or is\nAre doing a kind of project merit costs like ... of how left wing journals except crazy studies as long as they contain the right buzz words and support leftist doctrine and they've gotten journals\nOf higher learning in applied disciplines of the academy to accept honor nonsense\n\nAnd one example of this as a feminist journal in academia accepted and anti male rewrite of mine comp these posters reroute a free thousand word essay\nOf mind comp\nAnd tool that as anti male pro women feminism and this journal accepted it\nSo basically they accepted a piece an excerpt from Adolf Hitler's mind comp read too old to have terms that would be buzz words and knee jerk reaction causes to them and they ended up falling forward left\nHook line and sinker another reason why I left winners are doing this because they're worried that the disciplines that they trust and believe in our being shattered by a bunch of absolute gobbledygook insanity\nAnd so they have prepared a series of hoax essays and papers and presented for peer review journals of higher learning on the academy\nThere obvious hoaxes the anybody who knows anything about the origins of the papers that served as the basis in this case mine comes\nBut this group of women accepted an essay right out of mind comp with just a couple of three words are terms changed to make it look like it was an anti male pro feminist piece\nOrderly embarrassing the details of this for a long and detailed in in the weeds\nBut it is that kind of thinking it makes me wonder or makes me realize where people like a Lexus Grinnell come from\nWhite women come and get your people let me give you just a sample poll quote to get an idea what I'm Talking about white women benefit from patriarchy by training on their whiteness\nTo monopolize resources for mutual game in return they're placed on a pedestal debate cherished and revered as Speaker Paul Ryan has said about women but all the while denied basic rights does anybody have any idea what that is\nDoes that make any sense when you heard me to read that did you go oh yeah yeah totally agree with you know you're shaking and say what\nThey read it again white women benefit from patriarch\nYeah I totally agree with you know you're shaking your head say what\nThey read it again\nWhite women benefit from patriarchy but those have you on the Rio Linda patriarchy means like where you live women are subjugated by the Mad Men run your house right but that that's what this means patriarchy\nWhite women benefit from patriarchy by trading on their whiteness\nTo monopolize resources for mutual gain other words they trade on their white and it's defined rich white guys to marry they sell out the sisterhood they sell themselves out\nAll to be placed on pedestals\nBut in doing so they are denied basic rights by the patriarchy and women who do this are sellouts and are not happy so every one of your white women who's married loves your husband loves your family you're a sellout now this has roots traceable back to the origin of metal and feminism in the late sixties\nBut then you have to stop and grab yourself and say she Alexis we don't really believe this is New York times must because they published it after a confirmation process where women all but slit their wrists\nLetting their stories of sexual trauma run like rivers of blood through the capital\nThe Senate still voted to confirm judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court with the exception of Senator Lisa Murkowski all the women in the Republican conference cave including Susan Collins of Maine who held out until the bitter and\nWomen all but slipped their wrists letting their stories of sexual trauma run like rivers of blood through the capital I guess she's talking about\nBalls the Ford some of the other is that\nBaird at all except balls they weren't getting bear anything we don't know where what happened\nAnd we don't know who did it\nAnyway next paragraph these women\nExcept for Lisa Murkowski are gender transfers to borrow from the hands may tell you they've made standing by the patriarchy a fulltime job the women who support them show up at the Capitol wearing women for Kavanaugh T shirts but also probably tell their daughters to put on the less revealing clothes when they go out\nThere more sympathetic to Orrin Hatch of Utah who actually shoot away a crowd of women in total the grow up or Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina who's response to a woman telling him she was raped was I'm Sorry color cops\n\nThese are the kinds of women who think that being falsely accused of rape is almost as bad as being raped the kinds of women who are agreeing with Trump it's a very scary time for young men in America but the people are scared me the most writes Alexis Grinnell or the mothers the sisters in the lives of those young men because mice to put uterus\nStill holds out some insane oh solidarity you women who love your husband's have gotten married have had families including sons who supported Kavanaugh you are selling out your honor fellow universes out there\nAnd this election is fit to be tied over it because you're being ... by the patriarchy you're thinking you're happy and having a good time but you're not you're miserable your rights are being denied\nYou're being mocked and laughed at by people like Donald Trump whom you're nothing more than a uterus\nWe're talking about white women she writes the same fifty three percent who put their racial privilege ahead

hello\n[laughter] Hi rush it is truly an honor to speak with you I Wish you could live forever and be on the airwaves forever [laughter]\nAnd I took a thank you very much\nI'm just a quick question for you um you know I think that the senators knew they weren't going to get the votes\n[noise] I'm just a quick question for you um you know I think that the senators knew they weren't going to get the votes\nOf the Democrat senators that is to oppose Kevin are and make make sure he's not on the bench and the Supreme Court so I was wondering [noise] um do you think that\nThe way they framed him with the media is something they're going to use later on to find the entire Supreme Court\nHack this strategically necessary and this goes back to the question do we need why women question at every candidate\nIs having a lecture real question every candidate needs to ask do we need it white women [noise]\nNow this wouldn't be happening if it hadn't been for the realization that a lot of white women supported Kevin ... and I don't know if it was so much that white women supporting Kavanaugh is that they were ... it it it scared to death at what they saw being set up\nAgainst men\nThey have sons they have brothers and anybody would have half a brain watching what went on the last two weeks would have to have been blind to see that the Democratic party had a line the itself in such a way\nThat men were stolen medical aid guilty simply because they exist\nSimply because they are capable [noise] in fact\n[noise] let's see there's actually a story with that exact point may the here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it\nBecause he has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball the forward that cannot could have done it well if you're old woman with the sun is in a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this\nYou wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation does require any evidence in fact the fact that there's no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nBecause that's what men do be cause man can and men\nCan because they have the genitalia necessary to do it and if you're an average ordinary decent woman watching this stuff how in the world you want to sign on to that well you dumped\nAnd so now these leftist women aren't enraged when they have discovered that they failed to persuade\nA bunch of average ordinary white women to join their cause anti Kevin Ball\nSo now these women are sellouts and there are ... are sellouts and their rooms are sellouts and they're selling out to the patriarchy and as such they become worthless and even a liability to the point now that here we have a soundbite with two women experts in gender studies saying\nDo we need white women\nIt's an electoral question every candidate needs to ask let me remind you in November of two thousand to eleven the Obama presidential campaign has written about by a Thomas Edison all in the Washington Post\nMight have been in New York Times on down\nThat they were for going the white working class\nAs a voting bloc and instead we're going to put together a winning coalition of us sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base because white working class voters were becoming less and less\nDependable because they weren't buying Obama an Obamacare and because of that they were becoming racist the traditional democratic little guy voting bloc they express no ... this is simply an evolution of that\nSo while the white working class was totally go pounds sand by the Obama campaign two thousand eleven now in two thousand Eighteen or\nDo we need white women it's an electoral questioned it every candidate needs to ask\n[laughter] folks ... misunderstand what I'm doing here I'm not doing this simply to express in the credibility of this\nDoing this under the auspices of how in the world can a majority or mainstream of Americans in any way support this party\n\nRealize I'm setting myself up here for what might be a major shocking disappointment the day\n\nI realize I'm southern myself up here for what might be a major shocking disappointment the day after the election in November and I'm not making any predictions here I'm just\nI'm I'm I'm genuinely serious\n\nI just don't see how the actions the words the policy is the attempts to inspire and persuade I just I don't see how any decent normal people fall for this\n\nI realized that Democrats have educated a lot of people in the last two generations\nI realize a lot of college educated people have come out of these institutions that may have been corrupted and polluted with this crap and since most people are not what they wish they were most people are not as successful as they ... want to be\n[noise] most people do think about what they don't have rather than what they do\nAnd if that's who you are if that's if that's the personality type then it's not very big step to start blaming somebody else for what you don't have becomes very easy to blame some faceless patriarchy some faceless white privilege power structure some faceless bunch of\nMeanings depriving you denying you discriminating against you\n\nSaw the lab has to do is get hold

unhappy people it's not challenging to find a bunch of people that are\nBeating themselves up and all you have to do is ... is convinced those people that\n\nSomebody else did it to the Republicans but white privilege power structure did it too and there's only one way to fix it and that's the wipe them out I Know they've educated a lot of people believe is now anyway back to the phones we go in

know they're going to kick them front and center he's not going to go away in ... defeated him\nThey would have just pick someone equally is right wing his cabinet on at a random through in in a lame
