twenty ninth team the calendar and the article it shows the optimal dates for federal employees to retire now\nOr the state's going to be the same for all federal employees\nBass dates to retire you'd be surprised how often I get this question especially from federal employees because there's some\nThere's some just general consensus out there that there has to be at best date to retire to maximize your federal benefits it's it's kinda like one of those things where you feel like everybody else has the answer and that you should get the answer but you don't have it until you need it\nAnd if that makes any sense whatsoever but it works that way with me and parenting too [laughter] yeah I feel like I shouldn't be doing something but until I'm faced are are confronted with having to deal with with something with the kids I don't really learn how to do it and so for federal employees as they get into their last maybe year or two of employment\nThey start to evaluate their federal benefits they look at there may be there and knew their annuity projection their pension projection how their ts he is going to work and retirement but then they also want to know\nHow you know what what is

spending time with family or going on vacation or living in a different place if it's spending time with your grandkids or traveling the world whatever that is for you\nIt's important to get into that retirement mindset and write it down what's going to make your life facility and close if you don't mind just first second when you're doing this close your excel spreadsheet shut it down I\nDon't think about your accounts don't think about the pension rules or the federal benefit rules and said just for a moment think about you and think about what's going to make your life facility and then once you have a target once you know what's going to make your retirement worth it\nThen go back to your federal benefits and figure out how to connect your vision to the assets of you've accumulated\nWinter and his team can help you go through this process where you can shut down that spreadsheet as winter said and focus on you make the focus on yourself and what you like to do and

L. more Washington comes to talk [noise]\nThanks for spending part of your weekend here with us on about federal benefits and let her trach\nFilm I'm generally jak alongside winter you can learn more at winter attracts all dot com winter a new study by Merrill Lynch called financial journey of modern parenting indicates parents are putting their retirements at risk with almost three out of four parents putting their child's interest ahead of their retirement needs\nHow can parents balanced taking care of their family's needs well also setting aside enough for retirement\nYou know I think it's a tough balance I mean not just with family Gen but but also just\nSpending today and maintaining the quality of life that you're looking for today and then balancing that with what you're going to need down the line ... and it's even you know it's tough when you think about family whether you're helping a parent with medical expenses or if you're taking care of kids that you always want to do best for the people that you love\nAnd but you also don't want to put yourself at risk and I think it's a challenge for all of us especially as we go through the accumulation phase\nOf retirement but you know there is one thing that comes to mind it's it's something that we hear every time that you fly is that you pull that off if there's if there's no pressure in a cabin you pull the oxygen mask over your face and then you help others mhm\nRight I think a lot of ways we forget the fact or it can be forgotten that if we don't take care of ourselves we can become even more of a burden to our loved ones\nRight into in some ways if we sell ourselves short\nThat it's going to come back and hurt our kids or parents more than more than we ever really anticipated I realized it's interesting Gen when people get to retirement I find that a majority is no perfect way but a majority liked the idea of of making sure\nThat in retirement that they're going to be okay and then they think about maybe passing on money officially to kids\nBut you know so many people that I meet with at some point you have to deal with settling a parent's estate\nAnd I've seen all different kinds of situations siblings fighting probate taking six months twelve months Eighteen months that everyone agreed on how things should be settled how fair should be distributed and I often think about the fact that if you have a good retirement income plan\nIf you know your withdrawal strategy if you understand your federal benefits if you know how to use the CSP are Social Security if you know how to draw your pension and set up your your equity and and your situation for retirement than many times you also solve for taking care of your kids to pass on\nYou know oftentimes I say well the best gift that you could ever give yourself is to have a true distribution plan to retirement\nI mean the benefits are obvious peace of mind secure retirement and understand how to build your quality of life but the secondary benefits you don't really think about the secondary benefit of having a distinctive plan for distribution\nLeads right into the efficiencies of what's going to happen at the end a retirement in other words\nIf you know how to distribute your assets if you know which accounts to withdraw from first and second and third and if you have a tax strategy if you know how to use your ts be effectively\nThen it's that distribution plan is going to take into account how you should hold those assets in the second half retirement or maybe even how those assets are going to pass on to your kids or how you're going to have enough money for a long term care or the flexibility that you might need down the line\nAnd so Gen in many ways a good distribution plan\nTaking care of yourself that retirement\nCan often times also take care of your kids sometimes without you even knowing\nRight and we think about people who stay in that accumulation mindset\nIs what our financial advisor would tell us to do right we just stick with our investments we stick with our T S P as it's currently invested\nAnd the only difference or the only change that we make when we retire is occasionally we make withdrawals\nAnd since we're untrained sometimes we don't even make those withdrawals until the government forces us to at Seventy and a half and so we just keep going and we hope it works out and and we never truly have a distribution plant we never get everything that we can out of federal benefits and then we pass on all that ugliness\nTo our kids they get inherited IRAs they have armed D's if probate to go through what man what if we just flip that script plus just\nTo our kids they get inherited IRAs they have armed do they have probate to go through what man what if we just flip that script plus just flip the script let's be proactive have a true retirement income plan to have a true distribution plan\nTo them and and what happened to them with their mom and ... and his wife and so sitting across the table from him and explained to them how those retirement dollars weren't really his and fall\nThat the IRS has a portion of matter of fact if you take too much out any given year then\nYou could end up paying more taxes than what you didn't pay while you were working\nAnd no one had told him before\nKnown and told him before noon and everyone had just encouraged him to save as much as possible and to the retirement account if you could get the match maybe even save and do catch up and maximize your four one K. maximize your T S P\nPut money into your IRAs and you'll be okay for retirement but in this case no one ever pulled him aside\nAnd asked him about his dream with his daughter never asked about how much money he would need to find this restaurant\nAnd so we had this time bomb this tax that needed to be paid that he wanted to avoid and it really compromise his ability to live the retirement that they wanted in a way that he wanted he might be thinking well winter I I feel bad for the gentleman but you know I'm not going to start a restaurant\nBut I Want you to think about taxes in a different way because ultimately the money that you've saved for retirement you want to ... for you to use and some of it's going to be to replace income that makes sense\nBut what about project at the house what about traveling a little bit more than than you might be able to while you're working what about paying for your kids weddings or helping with the grandkids or whatever it is it's important to you will have a cost\nAnd so it's really important that you not run into the same tax situation as this gentleman did\nRight and I think oftentimes people will save into retirement accounts and not really be sure how to use them and they grow and grow and grow and grow and we get to our MDs and we pay taxes that that bomb goes off and we pay more taxes than we ever thought that we would\nAnd we don't have the flexibility that we need to get new windows or put a refund their house or redo the kitchen or help our kids in general really impact me as most people just aren't sure what to do and they do what I like to term value engineering let me give you a glimpse or look into what value engineering looks like\nWorking with a couple of for about two years they have a distribution plan but the husband had been working with an accumulation of advisor for Twenty years and so even though they knew enough\nTo put a distribution playing into place they were still learning how to truly live it out and so we're doing in a in a review and and the wife brought in the husband I could tell to meet with me so that I could kind of re train him on distribution planning right it's kind of fascinating\nHow this works where she gives me looks she asks questions I kind of lead me into certain answers and then she just looks at the husband is if he's getting it yet and so she explains to me she says winter you know we're we've been arguing about whether we should change or into a cruise to an every other year Cruz okay\nYou know what we can do financially and she also asked me about moving their laundry room from the basement to the main for something the wife had wanted for a long long time we talked about it and are planning and kind of how to strategically take care of that\nAnd I had to remind the husband that things are different when you're spending money versus accumulating\nAnd in in this case they had left some of the money with accumulation advisor they move some money to for their distribution plan and and so they were hearing both sides in terms of the voices they heard accumulation advice and then distribution advice for me and there was some confusion and I had to remind this particular client that\nAssets need to be segregated and retirement\nThey have to be segregated and what I mean by that is we don't invest all the money the same way like you would have in your accumulating\nRight and and some people have different accounts and they think that's diversification right they might have an IRA or tea SP but most of the time the monies are invested in similar ways and and they're invested in a way that's built for accumulation willing distribution we start segregate him money according to use\nAnd so what that means as we might invest money differently\nFor the money that's going to produce income different than the money that's going to be for future long term care different than the money that might be used for a cruise or a house project two years down the road and so we start segregating assets\nBut the husband just couldn't get out of this accumulation mindset this idea that the real objective in retirement was to continue to get a rate of return and to try not to spend money\nAnd it's funny right because great savers make for horrific spenders [laughter] right every savers I mean imagine being a great saver and this couple I can tell you lived well within their means and accumulated\nHorrific spenders [laughter] right irate savers I mean imagine being a great saver and this couple I can tell you lived well within their means\nAn accumulated a lot more assets than most of retirement because of that and the husband but she was she was stuck there that have been was stuck there that the only way he could be responsible was by oil is saying no to the cruise into the carpets because he didn't know how to live the distribution plan\nAnd I think what we all want where we all want and retirement I think is you're listening this afternoon maybe even what you're thinking is how do I go about making the right decisions financially for retirement\nAnd still be responsible right if I if I earned my badge of honor financially by learning how to grow and save my money how do I learn how to be just as responsible\nAnd successful when I'm spending it\nAnd that's a tough one because if you have accumulated assets by always saying no how do you learn how to say yes and it's all built right into knowing how to distribute your assets I mean imagine how exciting it is for me to be able to help people really use their money right accumulated money's boring [laughter]\nHumility money doesn't pay the mortgage accumulating money doesn't pay for vacations while you're working its just accumulating for a time and retirement but what's so exciting about the show and and when I get to meet with listeners and help them with their distribution of planning is we talk about how to use the money it's a different mindset\nAnd so I reminded the husband in this case that we had invested money\nFor the house project there was money set aside for the vacations and it was segregated it was not going to impact their ability to have a quality of life it wasn't going to touch their emergency fund their slush fund for the second phase of retirement that it was already built into the distribution plan\nThat we had factored in all of the unknowns and we had matched their assets up to their retirement vision and when we sat down that first time it was clear what they wanted\nThey wanted to maintain their quality of life\nThey wanted to be able to go in there cruises once a year and you know what those house projects that they've deferred all these years they actually wanted to do so that they can enjoy their retirement more and I just had to remind them that that's what a distribution plan is all about\nOutcomes it's about the outcomes that matters right it's it's not saving into your TSE that matters the most it's knowing how to use what you've saved that matters it's the outcomes you know think about it\nI think about how you would feel if you got into your late eighties and early nineties reflecting back on your retirement and you didn't achieve the outcomes that you wanted if you didn't have a life fulfilled if you didn't go on those cruises and you never move though the laundry room up to the first floor if you didn't\nHelp the kids when you wanted to help them and you were always worrying about money think about it think about the regret that you would have an instead\nTurn it around turn it around make your retirement about the outcomes be selfish don't worry about what product you own or whether the market's going to go up or down next month we don't have any idea\nBut instead learn how to use your assets learn how to use your federal benefits effectively so that you can go on the cruise you can maintain your quality of life you can do the house projects when they come up you can travel and help the kids and you don't have to worry financially\nRight the worst plan the worst plane is one that requires you to pay attention to the spreadsheet and pay attention to what's going on in the market the best plan the best plan has you focusing on your spouse and your family and your quality of life in retirement\nAnd if you'd like to get started on that retirement income plant in that distribution plant it's

hundred seven hundred eighty six number like usual but what was surprising to me that I was telling you before the show is our social media lines blew up between the consumer affairs the network capital dot net the Google phone number\nAnd those type of resources was definitely a spike a lot of families were interested in cash out pay off credit card debt cash out home improvements\nCash out to afford ball holidays I mean I'm not surprised that people are saying yes right now I was surprised with the amount of phone calls that came in so usually around right now people can afford their Christmas they like a month off the mortgage there's no real better month\nTo have the month off the mortgage payment than right around the end of the year\nYou get a lot of people that start or New Year's resolutions around right now so I'm excited about this week I have a feeling the the the trend is going to continue to filling a lot of families are really going to kind of digest the market that we're in they're going to realize hey this is what it is like the numbers aren't going to change\nIf anything they're probably going to go the other way on us now we can actually maximize our benefit we can see\nAnd ... they're going to realize hey this is what it is like the numbers aren't going to change if anything they're probably going to go the other way on us now we can actually maximize our benefit we can see results today and one thing I like is\nNetwork capital really has a package deal that most families are going to say yes to one thing I like about him is the lender own money which means you get access to amongst the lowest rates in the business they lend borrow money which means you guys get access to the fast during times like a ten day close\nWell that is definitely going to be a merry Christmas so were there with that forty five thousand dollars in cash and not to mention saving twenty seven hundred and thirty dollars a month in\nCredible this is the mortgage radio show I'm ... back with a mortgage experts John met her be sure to like us on Facebook follow us on Twitter and Instagram for the most up to date financial news and homeowner tips a big thank you to so many of you\nWho found that were capital online last last week our looking up\nAnd that we're capital on Google on consumer affairs on Yelp on Facebook on the better Business Bureau and so many folks called eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight it was just a great week and of course network capital\nDid some research they did some pretty sophisticated research actually they wanted to know\nHow was this show doing the people who called how how much were they saving we're we're we're networked were the folks who called really saving 'em enough money to make it worthwhile and what they found was\nAn average monthly savings of five hundred and twenty eight dollars and of course that comes out to six thousand three hundred and thirty six dollars a year\nNot bad for making a simple phone call to eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight they have mortgage banker standing by right now I live we do this every week shot and I this is our two hundred and first\nShell can't believe it and I just want to let you know that if you call that number the person who answers the phone will be a mortgage banker not somebody to take down your information and make an appointment as somebody get back to you know\nThe person who answers the phone will be the person who answers your questions because if you've been listening to our show for a few weeks or a few months or even just today you have some questions like for example what would your specific\nMonthly payment look like if you shorten the term of your loan\nUm but we before we get to that 'cause I I Love talking about short term loans ten years Fifteen Years and how much that can really change change your life in saving money but first before the break John brought in a recent result a family that went from a thirty ... thirty or fix ended up saving\nTwo thousand seven hundred and thirty dollars a month now like I said average savings five hundred and twenty dollars a month but this is just over the top so I was so curious about so many things first of all you mentioned they had thirty one thousand dollars in credit card debt and forty thousand dollars in\nPersonal loans and car notes\nIs that right so they were walking around with this humongous amount of high interest\nOne thing about that resolved that I'm really I Want to do a better job of explaining this is the customer only owed a hundred and two thousand on their house okay so on the personal loans in the car note the about forty eight thousand soldiers called half\nI mean it's truly close so half of the balance but it was more than triple the total monthly payment on those deaths because of the alarm in interest rates so what happened is is a lot of families might not have the best credit position or income position or equity position so they're backed into a corner\nThis family had to take personal loan and we're going to die in a personal on throughout the show you're going to see why I'm so against it but unfortunately we're having spent over two thousand dollars on just that dead so by eliminating the debt getting much better interest rates\nThey were able to really achieve maximum benefits so what I like about this result is gone are the days of ... over paying for for these high rates gone or the or the credit card debt\nGone as the days of let's say damage credit so the white the financial slate clean\nNow they don't have to worry about things in the past like the focus forward this family now has one payments to make I think\nYou know I've told my head was somewhere in the twenty amount of twenty dead so we eliminated all into one so instead of writing corny checks I'd rather just make one low fix payment\nAnd that's how this family was able to save so much money no like me I'm In the position with my age I'm thirty five years old I don't really care right now about going back to Thirty years and saving twenty seven thirty\nEven though there's a lot I can do with twenty seven hundred dollars in savings with investing and different aspects out there that\nA lot of people can teach you guys what to do but I Would actually go with this approach I'm already able to afford to keep my head above water what I'm doing now not a penny more penny less goes out of my pocket but I'm able to pay it off in four years a lemon month member they were sixteen months into a thirty year fix oh I see much more benefit by\nBy going that route I could have this thing paid off you know before I'm forty years old an apple find my savings of foreigners Seventy two thousand now I've got incredible credit the ...\nBy going that route I could have this thing paid off you know before I'm forty years old an apple find my savings of foreigners Seventy two thousand now I got incredible credit the next car I buy get better you know better rates the next time I Need to go and start a credit card I get better rates if the gift that keeps on giving the month off the mortgage can be used for Christmas\nThey didn't even have to pay for an appraisal so this thing was done in ten business days the Esther refund money is cash money into their pockets so\nThese are the type of results you guys can expect when you dial eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said now that was more than five times the average savings of her mortgage radio listener so you know for the average\nCustomer when you dial eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said I Want you expecting the same about six thousand three hundred and thirty six year if you were to do with the thirty year figs cash out pay off some debt and really just set it and forget and work with nowhere capital so I Love their programs I Love the people behind the scenes\nI Love the business model that they structured I think it's going to be quite wonderful resolve this time moves on you're going to start seeing this result as rates continue to go up more and more companies are going to either raise their interest rates\nAre even more they're gonna raise their margins are going to\nAdd in lender fees they are going to try to supplement the loss of clientele so I don't want anything to do with that I don't want you guys have anything to do with that and for that reason I Want you to work with nowhere capital dial this number\nEight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said one percent mortgage professionals available at eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nAnd one percenters and know how to make it fast how to make it efficient they understand if your weekend and that you don't want to spend forever on the phone they can help you in terms of a lot of the paperwork gathering using pretty sophisticated software so if that's keeping from calling let me assure you\nThey understand that your time is precious and they can make it real fast and number\nEight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight one a lot of folks asked about and we touched on it\nThey're curious about at ten years or Fifteen year to shortening the term and of course there are tremendous benefits but not everyone is a great candidate a lot of the reason people call the number\nThey want to know what their specific monthly outgo would look like the tenor of the Fifteen I personally think that's a great use for the number maybe it's something you could afford because the rate break can be pretty steep so who's listening should be thinking about possibly going down to maybe a twentieth Fifteen or a tent\nI'd say somebody that likes paying less interest I happen to be one of those guys like you know when you showed me the numbers I was on one of the articles that you found that the difference between a thirty or fix any Fifteen year fix was sixty five percent difference on interest alone so that's alarming to me that got me like\nThat was like the stamp of approval with major easily you sold me hardcore on that\nI'm also I'm a control freak with my mortgage I Wonder when I make a payment I Wanna see principal reduction I Want to see noticeable results I Want to see that this winter something of value not interest I don't want to make it rain of interest on my lender\nLike they're not giving me Christmas cards they're not you know scratch my back they're not there in the time of need so I Want to take control and that's why I Love a shorter term loan I'm also credit guy I Believe in not only can I help my customers\nSave money on their mortgage but I can show them techniques to what to do with the month off the mortgage what to do with the U.S to refund I like to try to funnel that money towards increasing my credit scores maybe paying off delinquent dead\nMaybe you know offsetting something of maybe my my refrigerator needs repair to need a new stove I Need to upgrade some appliances within my home\nThat's great to use the leftover money for like a\nOf families loved that idea I'm also big on building a security nest egg of equity for a rainy day when you build equity you pay off the loan and when you build equity you all a little bit less which means you own a little bit more and that's why it's called a home owner and own a home over so\nStar with shorter term doesn't mean you have to do it a lot of our customers like starting with ten and then they kind of scale back to Fifteen a lot of customers start what twenty and then the scale back to thirty\nThe ten and Fifteen are very similar to the twenty and thirty are very similar so you know it's really a case by case it's a matter of what your goals are what you're looking to do how long do you want to be in the home you know what's up with your job is this a safe line of work for you is it stable like if something happens can you find you know a similar job in that market\nSo these things specifically matter and these are the conversations you have when you pick up the phone and you make contact with network capital there they they really want you guys to know that they don't charge cylinder fees that they can knock this thing on as little as ten business days this week the special offers it's four percent on the tenure fix\nThe a P R just dropped the four

M. A. Alabama's higher Mickey with Eva Shelley added to the ad is financial services\nTired do we need life insurance still because her about that and I work in your life\nInsurance is meant to supplement incoming taste something happened but we still need it after we stopped working I say\nYes and here's why so when you're young and you have a family and you have kids you have a mortgage you know typical you're going to buy term life insurance which is really cheap to pay off the house supplement income if you were to pass away while your family's still growing\nSo do you need term life insurance into retirement probably not said\nDo you need or can you benefit from permanent life insurance that can last year the rest of your life probably yes here's why I'm thinking of a family that were meeting with now that live in Fairfax [noise]\nShe was a schoolteacher for over Thirty years\nThey decided that she was going to take the pension on her life only instead of choosing a survivor benefit by purchasing a life insurance policy for the difference and monthly pension amount\n[laughter] they're able to buy a life insurance policy that can basically replace her income\nIf she was to pass away early so that's one good reason why you may consider a life insurance and retirement is for we call it pension maximum is Asian making sure the surviving spouse is taken care of should've pension stop should someone pass away you know much earlier than we have just a\nSecond reason and probably just as important or the living benefits available in life insurance today so another family just came in that we've been meeting with from maclean Virginia right near Tyson's corner\nThey've had for the last two years these long term care policies through a big property and casual the company that everybody would would know the name of a matter of fact showing I we have our insurance them our homeowner's insurance to them\nWell they've been paying three hundred and Fifteen dollars a month the last two years obviously nothing's happened early in their sixties haven't had a need for care\nWhat we recommended instead is permanent life insurance that's going to last and the rest of their life with long term care benefits added to it they're they're hybrid policies that can be used multiple different ways\nObviously the money will pass to each other when they pass away sacked free the whole death benefit can be spent down every month for a long term care and then they also have tax advantaged and potentially tax free cash accumulation inside the\nPolicy to put it really simply life insurance is not just here's something that I purchased in case something happens to me and I need to protect my family it can be used for many other ways apes discussing that is a totally different kind of mindset from the way people think of it currently\nSo this family and McLean loved the flexibility that these new hybrid life insurance policies offer because they can be used three different ways instead of just one way when you purchase stand alone long term care insurance\nFind out if life insurance could be used and otherwise you've never even thought of when it comes to your

planning on retiring in his mid sixties but some health problems happened and now he's fighting to get disability protection from his employer and from Social Security\nAnd he's got about a hundred thousand dollars in his four one K. and basically he may need to start tapping into that right now yeah and so he came into our office and pretty pressing needs and concerns or he has no life happened to him and he now needs to go probably into his four one K. for income\nYeah so there are a lot of wrenches that can be unfortunately thrown into people's plans or situations and I think maybe in his case it would have been helpful how'd he may be started planning with an advisor prior to something happening and this can be a health issue it can be a family issue anything like that but it's always good to make the time\nI think that that's the biggest thing was am I doing okay a lot of people want to know the answer to that question but making it the priority you know over your kitchen renovation or your vacations or your medical and dental you have to view it kind of on the\nWithin reason on the same playing field and that's really kind of sometimes what we see is a struggle is do it before it's like oh my gosh I have to figure out what's going on now\nIt's a big deal to wonder how you're doing because a lot of times you're wondering that 'cause you have concern you don't feel confident in what's going on with the future of your retirement that specific question how am I doing is why aid does where do I stand plans for people just like you are listening nearing in retirement\nIt's sitting down with a B shelling the team for an hour or so and then even the team developed an additional three hours or more\nCustomizing this where do I stand plan for you doing a detailed analysis of your risk tolerance explaining what required minimum distribution means farewells researching all your Social Security benefit options and hospital healthcare and long term care costs you might need to prepare for just like that story we just heard about\nIncorporating inflation into the plant and ultimately Abel help you make sure that you're a legacy plan and retirement income plan Metra needs in lifestyle now and in the future we set aside some appointments in the coming weeks for you or radio listeners for that where do I stand plan that second opinion\nFive seven

accounts and he has business analyst just less than just says that was their ideas is to require planet minister raiders to show you how much income your retirement could generate\nWhen you get the lungs sell them out today it would also have to be translated into what this means for lovely income in the future I think is a good way to get people to sensitized to the fact that you got a lot of money in there but when you look at it as a monthly income is not that much money\nWould be helpful to give people a more specific idea of how long their money might last\nAbsolutely I mean this is essentially what clients want from us is hey we have this amount of money we have Social Security we may or may not have a pension\nWhere this amount of money in our four one K. R. T. S. P. R. Irish how are we doing\nHow much income while our funds create can we leave any money to our children grandchildren but most importantly are we going to be okay and retirement is this amount of money saved up enough to create the income that we need in retirement so but I think it's\nNot what the government kind of over eating that's that's why I get a little nervous I got to be honest\nI see it in a positive light I see him perhaps providing you know calculators and different types of things like that or do I guess that would allow participants to kind of run some numbers on their own and say okay I have a half a million this is going to create thirty thousand dollars a year or twenty five hundred dollars a month for the rest of my life\nAssuming a certain rate of return and inflation and all these things so I see it being a positive thing but ultimately everyone's needs are different every ones\nAssuming a certain rate of return and inflation and all these things so I see it being a positive thing but ultimately everyone's needs are different everyone's goals and income needs and retirement are different and you know you really want to meet with a professional and make sure that what you had is going to do what your four one K. statement says it's going to do yeah\nAnd I think it's really important to note I Know we've talked about this before on the show that aid is uniquely focused on the income part of your your life ... so you have the accumulation portion where your nearing retirement and then you have to start thinking about how do we come down and how do we generate income and is that enough\nAnd that is something that a lot of people are still kind of stuck in the wrong phase of where they should be um and they need to start thinking in terms of income um and it really makes people feel better to have that plan and to really have a good understanding of how they're going to come down that retirement mountains so to speak\nAlmost all retirement planning advice is given on the front and part of retirement planning the accumulation part all the growth what are your earning rate of return et cetera\nThat's really not ... but to our clients those clients that are fifty five to seven fifty five Seventy five they're also concerned and want to know how they're doing with the backing part of retirement planning the second phase of retirement planning which is income\nThat's what we specialize in\nOkay trust and you have this amount of money ... this is what it can generate every month for the rest of your life ultimately you save the money for yourself and you've probably saved it for income your income in retirement so that really should be a good part of the conversation\nWith anybody anyone really fifty or older because now you're getting really close to having to start to tap into your retirement funds for the first time in your life\nSo we believe retirement is all about income and you've got it on your income plan figure it out\nIt's all about income when we really get to the bottom of the each week here on the show and it's not because they have until they want to sound like a broken record it because it's that important when it comes to your retirement\nThat you have income coming in those are all things that they address what the type of planning that age has been doing for over Fifteen Years helping people nearing and in retirement with their wealth and that where do I stand plan helps you figure out where your income is going to come from\nAnd how much you're going to have and how much you're

know when and how to take it all the Social Security options that can get overwhelming and confusing and knowing how that affects taxes and the retirement and the possible options with health care cost and long term care and how expensive that could be in the future how you're going to afford that\nMaking sure inflation is a part of the income plan\nAnd ultimately eight helping you make sure
