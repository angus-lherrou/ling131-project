into these are the owners I went to a donor a bunch of people\nThink there's going to be a red wave like you can't believe I tried to test on them\nI rather than joined them in their enthusiasm I tried to talk them down a little bit I just wanted to test whether they were being emotional or whether they actually bought it out\nSo I ran or you do I got to be a red wave and it's going to be big it's going to shock everybody people are going to be done just like they were two years ago I said okay well\nI Hope you're right but let me let me give you some facts on the ground\nForty oh yeah we're going to get to the birthright citizenship is just a second here but I Want to set it up with this man this is great what Trump is doing on birth for all this is exactly what Trump was elected as my good friend McCarty any recording that you gotta have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nAll of the above surprises in advance have worked to enhance the conservative red wave according\nAll of\nThe above surprises and events have worked to enhance the conservative red wave according to this guy instead of creating or building a blue wave of the red wave continues Republican voter intensity exceeds the much heralded\nBlue wave even by the way this is what you want to blue wave would be what we need to properly defined a blue wave would mean the Democrats win everything they take back the Senate they take back the house by a large number if the Democrats win the house by two or three seats for England it's none of them that's not a blue\nWave a blue wave means a massive massive realignment and it doesn't look possible they are going to they're going to win the Senate they don't want the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about um reality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want if they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and turn out\nBy Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented Republicans seldom show up as well in early voting it's hard to explain it away\nBut the conclusion is that there has been all blue way there's not even to the blue ripple that you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSort of blow bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support longtime blue congressional districts\nAnd major coastal cities so this guy is on the firm belief that a conservative red wave or Republican a red wave is coming and is on the way [noise] many other people are either I've [noise] I've\nHeard some people who were rush look if I got to be very very careful those forty five Republican retirements that's that's [noise] that's just awesome I don't know how to factor all of that that's more retirements in a single year than we're ever used to having to factor in\n\nHere and the power of incumbency and those forty five seats has been has been lost I think by the way the\nPolitical professionals are going to be\nHyping the fact that this as things stand now this is probably what you're going to hear from a lot of places same set now looks like the Democrats might win a house but maybe four seats and that's going to be\nDesigned to get you to not get lazy and overconfident that don't don't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the is the evidence of panic\nThat is prevalent throughout the drive by media because their efforts to derail Trump have failed every one of them including one big one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly ... loaded with Russia's Robert Mueller was supposed to have delivered the guards the\nSpecial counsel buying now was supposed to have core Trump Trump was supposed to be on the way out by now do not doubt me that's what everybody on the left held out in great hope for the special counsel investigation\nBarring a natural report they had been hoping and praying for a week [noise] that would be\nIndicative that the report does say that Mahler found hard evidence that Trump important cheated and stole the election from a court shows over the hill\nDummies but there aren't even any such leaks\nThat's the big one that has blown up do not doubt me on this\nBy now mother was supposed to have delivered the guards that drive by media was supposed to have delivered the leaks\nSo now it's off the plan B and plans see and so forth and that's why I say that kind of it's obvious panic also argues against the fact that they feel confident\nIn a in a blue wave let's take a brief time out will come back we'll delve into will get started delving into the

cutting edge and doing what I was born to do by the way some of these forty five\nRetiring Republican as some of them were rhinos I mean but they're not at all not total losses there were a lot of never Trump or is it in there and that's one of the reasons they retired I Would be remiss if I didn't mention is there were a lot of them I don't know about the total number forty five but a lot of them quit because they were just fed up\nThat Trump won and that Trump was leading the Republican Party and they don't want anything to do with it some of them are committee chairmen and decided it wasn't going to go back just being a regular house bozos because it's such a calm down you know to have been a committee chairman then go back to being just a regular bender or back venture\nIn their place\nAnd this this ... in their place many of the Republicans who got the primary nomination was replaced knees never Trump hers were retiring are Trump\nSupporters there Trump and so the the total number forty five resigning is not ... in and of itself a completely negative characteristic\nFine I'm resigning is not ... in and of itself a completely negative characteristic the power of

[noise]\n[noise] but let's get the birthright citizenship this I think as a follow want it to Donald Trump following through on one of the primary\nCommitments they made as a candidate which I think is responsible for his election and that is his promise to build a wall to get a handle on illegal immigration\nAnd to stop it because of its for ever changing consequences to this country but\nPrimarily with Trump is a law and order issue as it is with all the rest of us it's simply a law and order issue we have laws\nDefining legal and illegal immigration we have a political party that is pushing illegal immigration and actually both parties have\nTo the extent of promoting programs that have amnesty involved for all of them in both parties have different reasons for supporting in the meantime the very definition of what America is and what our culture is is under assault\nAnd the politicians in Washington don't seem to care because they think they're always going to be insulated from whatever negative changes result\nAnd in some cases it's even worse than that the left wants those changes the left wants this country\nOver thrown from the days of its sounding\nOut to the left America is it legitimate to tip morals it's in the sun because we were a slave nation and we discriminated in the original white privilege was the founding fathers\nThere were no founding mothers only founding fathers they're bunch of white privilege rich white guys make set up a company for themselves and their descendents so that was the argument leaving everybody else out and it's time to overthrow that and change it and it's a serious movement and it's\nIt's a ... you could have been traced the educational roots for this back to the Nineteen seventies Nineteen seventies as a [noise]\nAn offshoot of radicalism in the sixties is where the changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story\nDonald Trump and let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims akin to defy constitution and the end birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump offered a dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed a loon unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric with a weeks ago before the political mid term elections\nTrump's vow to enter the rights of citizenship for children of non citizens authorized immigrants born in America came in an interview with CEOs released yesterday Trump did not say when he would sign the order\nAnd some of his past promises use executive action of gone unfulfilled but whether he follows through on his threat or not the issue joins\nA string of actions intended to thrust the matter\nOf immigration into the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks as I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this is what pushing back looks like he was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent and dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept election results anymore and you know what that means we humans hold this country together all these years is the honoring\nIntellectual results yeah have a heated campaign you may have political parties and all of us really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago even go back two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections in shock\nGeorge W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by on the left what convinced that they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the senator waivers people were fed up with the Florida recount remember all that\nAl Gore got jobs the Democrats got cheated and Democrats are loaded for bear out what happened to Republicans won an added seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started talking about how well we're gonna have to modify some of what we believe are odd values so basis that goes in exit polls showed that values were a large factor in why people voted Republican\nWell fast forward it two thousand six than there is no knowledge with the Trump won they do not accept\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they\nDidn't want it we've gotten to a point where the rats\nAbout they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they didn't want it we've gotten to a point where the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is allowing to overthrow an election and its results of the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama the O. J. we're used to overthrow run a silent cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse those election results it's unprecedented\nPat Buchanan has peace out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty eight featured even more\nViolent unrest that we haven't yet seen this year but we're getting close\nYou can always go back in time and find a period where it was worse than it is at present you can always go back and fight the civil war but it is a seminal moment when a political party\nAs its official position refuses to accept election results and that's where we are and that's why we're where we are they refused to accept it for whatever reason they hate Trump I don't feel good about it they disagree whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous thing\nBecause what if it keeps up what is the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections you know I I predict that some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out as well was just a lemonade elections of elections or what's holding us back let's find a way that will lemonade him\nPeople laugh to come on rice it's never going to have to do not ever say the left isn't capable of anything ever\nSo now Trump rather than being intimidated by their refusal to accept his election or rather the feelings hurt Trump doubles down triples down every time they hit him he hits back\nWith additional energy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order and birthright citizenship is huge and it's why he was elected when things are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong and out of control\nYou have to have somebody willing to go outside the so called boundaries in Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defines this is what changing the left is the way it looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\n\nAir requires a strong stomach and strong foreigners to an end there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they had made the promises Trump made I think all of them would have caved by now\nBut Trump hasn't he doubles down All right I'm going to just some of the district executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship [noise] let me read the or the fourteenth amendment ... begins\nAll persons now the fourteenth amendment goes back to Eighteen ...

the local leaders are saying that we must come together and stuck we must stop the violence we stopped\nIsn't that interesting\nThat's what's different now there is no interest in that\nWe don't even

get them on the on the legal immigration side of course are\nBut this this mass illegal immigration has an entirely different purpose behind it ends at political support is entirely different for it then for standard or immigration so what Trump is doing is simply with his executive order if he does this\nWill be reestablishing the constitution to re asserting it so yeah no you're exactly right about that so two calls so great points the the guy who from Pittsburgh who asked a question he lives there and he watches the news and he's been blamed\nFor the Senate God surely [noise]\nWe've got

it'll have to get there that\nNo Senator Graham is going to offer legislation that in the Senate ah\nLook we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here\nWhich has to happen there\nThere there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject\nOf immigration and so Trump and his ... the roots of an executive order is good but there's the you know they're going to be a judge\nThat's going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that I mean that'll happen within hours of Trump signing the executive order everybody involved you know it was that's going to happen that then begins the process and it probably will end up at the Supreme Court unless Congress does\nRight legislation in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nOr it may take more than just the statutory act\nAnd the left and they've got\nPlenty of judges out there are going to be using every damn one of them to try to shut down every effort here\nLet's see this is how folks this is how we ended up having a chance to win by shining a light on the left in who they are and what they do by forcing them out of the shadows and

Americans ... because\nAll of these things are why the people I talked to who think that there's not going to be a blue wave thinking they think more and more Americans because of Trump are finally the liberalism and action as opposed to having been told what liberalism is and who liberals are\nThere now see it and once that happens it's it's harder for the left to win\nI mean if they could win

I just wanted to make a quick point that's a hard left and the media and the specially Hollywood and I think it has been engaging in gas lighting a the right\nWould you what would you define that I hear so many people to use that word [noise] okay what you're telling me how your impending it to be defined\nOkay gas lighting um\nThere's so many people to use that word [noise] okay would you tell me how your impending it to be defined\nOkay gas lighting and the most common example is when I'm In a family they cripple usually been nice this child in the family to take care of all of that they can and burned\nAnd what they do is say ridicule that person they talk about and they snare at then especially when people aren't looking\nAnd then at that person dares to get angry oh look look look at look at how bad you are and then they tell everyone they know how bad this person is and they make an entire narrative and what they believe rush it that that person is an idiot they're not even\nGas lighting is if that's what the definition is now heartily endorse it and ah and\nAccepted and it's this arrogance and just supremacy or superiority that goes along with that kind of coverage and it's it's everywhere it's\nYou have a the synagogue shooting ball with the obvious the obvious explanation is that Donald Trump and his conservative media posse are radicalizing and this becomes the narrative this becomes just the way it is and everybody thinks this\nIs crucial for the made it a weather report these things to make it look like they are the majority and they are what's normal went increasingly they aren't\nAnd what really is happening here is that people who know they're not by definition\nSpent numbers normal are trying to turn everything upside down so that what they are is normal and what everybody else is is the one that's odd ball abnormal the media is right in their facilitating this or that I'm telling you it isn't it used to work like a charm\nAnd on many people still does we still have a lot of people in our sights don't want to couch how the media still wanted to find whether or not conservatives or Republicans are succeeding by virtue of whether the media as being nice to or not it's frustrating to no end when I run into people like that and they're out there\nBut the\nElectoral results just in the past two years ah indicate that people are more and more aware of this in pushing back\nAgainst that uh to see what [noise]\nI didn't see this I didn't watch Fox News Sunday Sunday but apparently Chris ... I gotta I got you know I'm On Fox News Sunday twice a year\nDuring ratings month [noise] and Chris Wallace is always very\nPolite and exceedingly nice and asks me to make sure to tell you not to get mad at him for interrupting me because he doesn't he would never get a question and after ... the first one\nSo I got a note from a golf buddy who watched this past Sunday man this guy wall as you say he's a good guy but disguised gone so far left I don't know if I I don't know if I could believe what you're telling me about him anymore\nSo I said well what happened well it clearly wasn't this\nOn Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace contrast in front page headlines from the Washington\nPost the day after ... was shot in Alexandria, Virginia by Bernie Sanders supporters with the Washington Post headline following the capture of mail bomb mastermind\nAnd Trump's support her ... and not surprisingly the post made sure to emphasize that say ox political views were mentioned in the headline while a guy that shot up ... was not mentioned\nPolitically at all and it's Chris Wallace holding used to headlines up and pointing it out let's say I can line written bombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump\nWallace said that the headline really surprised him he expected the Washington Post headline to read something like suspect arrested\nA closer inspection of the article finds it does not even mentioned that ... was the bombing suspect and someone for paragraph instead the first three paragraphs read like a psychological profile of the guy talking about his support for Trump and all of stickers on his van\nBut on the other hand the headline after the ... shootings send congressman shot in Virginia in didn't mention his name it didn't mention his support for Bernie Sanders and the front page article did not mention um anything infected foot noted\nHis support for Sanders and it barely like an asterisk mentioning that the guy was highly critical of President Trump so here's Chris Wallace holding up the obvious evidence of media bias here that he said surprised him\nLater on in the in the show adjacent in riling up a Wall Street journal was on he said if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and if you want to know why Trump won't give up social media this is why these two headlines or why and they ... play right you folks it every day Donald Trump\nWon't give up social media this is why these two headlines or why ... play right you folks every day Donald Trump is the only Republican waving\nOr informing people about the success of his policies everyday stock market good Trump's tweets everyday consumer confidence up Trump's tweets that every day what ever the economic noses or whatever the successes that his agenda his administration is having he tweets\nAnd if it weren't for him it wouldn't be out there are other than us of course here or in so called alternative media but the but but the point is the Republican Party is not even touting the Trump administration's agenda successes Trump alone is doing it\nAnd that's why he's not going to give up the opportunity to do it and I hope he never does\nBut when I when I realized this that Trump is the only guy like today there are a couple of tweets from Trump tweeting the consumer confidence\nAs being at a record high and and relating to how can people be voting Democrat when this kind of great economic news has been the ... the news of the day for two years\nThere's all kinds of Republicans running for election and four hundred and thirty five house seats [noise] thirty five thirty six Senate seats where\nIs I don't ... McDaniel is out there waiting some things out now but where is the party in general touting itself\nAnd its achievements and you don't see it other than from Donald Trump\nAnd he's not whining about that he's unabashed aide just tweets about two and a and gas and eat sweets the truth out about the media\nAs they report on him and lie or distorts or what have you but there is an incredible incredible series of success stories\nThat at any time in the past would have been of great help\nAnd you and assistance in running for election or reelection great news that would portray and show the Republican Party integrate light and Trump's it for the most part\nUm it really when you stop to think about it is it's such\nA one man show in many regard as such such a missed opportunity the consumer confidence news I\nCannot even be with all the news you see every day if you tuned into any drive by outlook\nEven reading the drudge headlines you wouldn't think we're on the verge of ... floating and yeah consumer confidence is at an all time high well that's a reflection of how people living literally living and their and their their thoughts on the future\nAnd his role bus positive\nHow can that be if everybody's running around miserable and and the various stages of fatal is Yvonne defeat\n\nIts it's important it's very uh being positive is a hard thing to do in any circumstance were not hardwired for it human beings are hard wired for pessimism\nI've discussed this many times human beings have a natural tendency to defeat ism and federalism 'cause it's easier uh it leaves the victim hood which of course that's attractive 'cause it always means somebody else's to blame for what did happen to you or did the failures or whatever so\nIt's just a natural tendency to tend toward the negative everybody knows how and everybody does it but it takes direct application you have to pause and take stock\nTo actually think positively about things I Do it all the time I'm I'm ... I get my cell phone in his or over something and I'll I'll stop and remind myself\n... unbelievably fortunate I Am an blessed but this tendency\nIs to be overwhelmed with the things that are disappointing or depressing or angry\nAnd\nFor that reason I it's easy to get caught up and all of them\nThe negative is them and we are no doubt in the midst of of a serious serious challenge for our country but it shouldn't override or neck gates\nThe real true is that we still live in America and we still have the greatest opportunity if we want to try to make the most of it can capitalize on it yeah the obstacles may be bigger and there may be more of them but it's still possible because people are doing it every day\nAnd I think the the ...\nAnd there may be more of them but it's still possible because people are doing it every day\nAnd\nI think the election needs to be looked at in a with a combination of these ways it's a positive opportunity to continue on the corrective pass that were on\nAnd it it it's just better way to live but it takes application to do it when you're bombarded constantly\nWith negative things that I must you know we all are guilty of doing that in a sense because we all want to sound appropriate warnings budget important to keep things in perspective at the same I've got to take a break I should develop this even more", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "city": "Washington", "day": "30"}
