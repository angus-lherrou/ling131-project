M. A. L. more Washington comes to talk\nAbout that are all benefits of winter track both things so much for joining us today I Am generally pleased to be here alongside\nWinter and winter you mentioned how kitchen design is like retirement planning tell our listeners what on earth you're talking about how these things are similar\nSo heavily so I was meeting with\nA perspective new client and she was like winter I Need to know what to do with my best friends and I wouldn't answer\nAnd not that I was like avoiding the question but I kept wanting to go into a more much more strategic direction and she said winter winter winter you're not listening and you're not listening and she happened to throw into our our small talk before we got into the planning that she was a kitchen designer and I said okay\nI said tell me about kitchen design\nAnd I said just go with me a little bit on the right and she said okay she goes well I design kitchens and then\nWe remodel kitchens and I said okay do you normally start with\nLike the type of countertops than the colors and the types of cabinets or do you normally start with a strategy and she has a ...\nOkay and I said yeah right you mean with their clients and you'd probably talk about their taste their preferences maybe even their finite resources and finite space and you try to get a feel strategically\nFor where that particular household fits right so you have I think the professional has the skill set the versatility to kind of understand different perspectives and then you learn the perspective of the client and you understand the financial resources in space and kitchen design\nAnd then you propose you a blueprint\nA first set of ideas hey Mr Mrs ... you know what I considered your resources your budget your space your preferences here's my first glimpse here's some just some pictures of the type of style that I think that we could do any kind of get into that strategy conceptually\nAnd assuming that you get agreement you go to the next step if you don't get agreement then you adjust the vision you adjust that concept and once you have the concept is only then that you do the real design and even after design\nThen you're picking out the color countertops and that type of counter tops and the type of space because you know how it fits into the whole project\nAnd so we went through that conversation I said well yeah that's what I Want to do in this meeting and that's what when someone comes into my office the first time\nWell of course we want to kick butt and retirement but the way that we're going to do it is we're going to first learn\nDivision we're getting a better understanding of the resources and the time horizon but even more than that we want to really understand preferences why does it matter to pick the right ts be option why isn't important to get the rights Social Security strategy or whether they're not to take Medicare\nYou know what are we trying to accomplish for this particular in your case for you or for your household what's\nMost important for you and then we can take our years of experience of having the you know the fact that I've been retired for a couple of thousand times through our clients I can take that knowledge in my own expertise and tried to apply it to that unique vision\nFor the person who comes in and so we have a concept okay conceptually based on what I've learned about you and based on your resources here's what I think you here's what I think the choices are here's the conceptual plant here's the distribution plan addict conceptual strategic level\nAnd then in the same way that you can work through the blueprints of a kitchen design we can work through and amend in changing adjust that conceptual strategy were not tied to product\nWe're not tied to the investment that someone has when they come in we're not tied to any bias because it's just a blueprint as just the strategy so we don't have to be limited and are thinking\nRight we want it to be practically correct with other than that we're not limited and thought and then once we have strategic agreement\nThen we go back to how the kitchen is right now and we talk about how to retrofit it we go back to the investments that are held right now\nAnd knowing that we want to set it up for retirement we want to upgrade it we want to build for the transition to retirement it's only then that we would know how to retrofit\nSomeone's accumulation assets the SP IRAs investments savings thanks cetera how to use ... how to use the pension and Social Security it's only then that we would know the\nThe SP IRAs investments savings ... how to use ... how to use the pension and Social Security it's only then that we would know because we have a strategy will have a plan and we go back and then take those accumulation assets and transition them towards distribution\nSo we all like the million dollar houses but what's going to be appropriate for your assets and your retirement and and your priorities and so with a retirement income plan we start connecting the retirement vision to their retirement assets and start\nDefining what are the choices to be made\nYou know it's interesting there was a couple that that came in a few weeks ago and and they were\nHad both been divorced um they've found each other and and we're we're kind of setting up a new life for themselves but their in their mid fifties and\nThey not only had the challenge of integrating their household situations together and their finances together but then also in their new life they had some ambitions in terms of quality of life and things that they wanted to do and traveled that they wanted to do\nBetween now and retirement and then they wanted to move and retire successfully and so a lot of moving pieces\nAnd what they wanted was different than what it may seem right they didn't want to know the best mutual fund to own the best insurance product to own they were interested in what the stock market was going to do next week and said they had real definitive tangible needs\nThey wanted to know the most efficient way to set up their finances\nThey wanted to know well now that they're going to buy a house together for the near term what's a reasonable amount they should spent how much did they put down for a down payment what was going to be best for them especially considering the context of retiring in the next five to ten years\nAnd it was interesting because when I was asking them questions I think they were kind of mad at me\nSo mad like hostile mad but like man this guy's wasting our time he keeps asking us a lot of questions why won't he just tell us what to do\nAnd we got into the strategy and I noticed within just a couple of minutes they were leaning in like they were all in there hanging on every single word because they knew that the strategy conversation was where they were going to make things happen\nRight they knew when we talked about why their down payment should only be fifty thousand dollars\nAnd how they should say under a jumbo loan and how if they were able to find a home that four hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand range standard jumbo loan keep their payments at a certain amount keep their down payment on a certain amount that they could have flexibility in the near term\nThey would have enough money to save for retirement and we started connecting\nHousing decisions directly into their retirement vision\nRight and it became very real because they in in in one of the spouses that you know what I'm so excited and I'm like okay [laughter]\nAnd they're like we're so excited because we didn't tell you this but I had already met with a couple of hours as a matter of fact we've had kind of a debate we've been kind of argument about whether we use my advisor\nOr we do a new and we've heard you on the radio and we kind of decided that we you were speaking to us over the radio and so we decided to me with you and I've been a little bit hesitant\nBut for all the times that I've spoken with my advisor they've never shown me the path to using my money they always are talking about my portfolio or the investments or why they made this trade or that trade or a rate of return but anytime I've asked them about how to make her time at work\nHow to negotiate through changing\nMy housing or getting married or divorced they didn't know what to do they just kept defaulting back to my investment account\nAnd so I always knew that I needed some different in when I listen to radio show I feel like that's what you're talking to me\nBut now I can feel the tangible benefit because you're really showing me that retirement income play like even though we're not retired you're showing us how to use the money that we've saved to accomplish what we want and when it comes to housing that's what we're talking about we're talking about\nReally appreciating where you want to live and what you want your life to look like in connecting it most effectively with the assets that you have\nSurely there are no one size fits all answers when it comes to that retirement plan winter and his team that bridge mark wealth management can help you build that customize plan it's going to factor in your federal benefits as well as your other assets and they'll help show you\nHow to put all those pieces together into your own retirement income plan\nThey'll show you how to make the most of those benefits and they'll help you work toward your goals and retirement but you need to call now to set up a time to get started on that retirement income plan you can do that by calling three oh one eight five zero zero six eight three again that number is three oh one\nFive zero zero six eight three winters we talk about why\nStates three again that number is three oh one\nEight five zero zero six eight three winters we talk about lifestyle in retirement we're all familiar with the process of test driving a car before you buy it we all do that we know to do that do you ever tell your clients to test drive their retirement lifestyle before they just jump into it\nNot really [laughter] I don't know I don't think of retirement those terms again of retirement\nBeing much more like a marathon oh I was a cross country runner so maybe a little bit of bias here now many many many years ago you're not going to find me running through a forest these shows but\nI was a long distance runner so I was a very good at the hundred yard dash but if it was a ten mile race I was going to be pretty hard to be and so I think you've trained for that a little bit differently than sprint or even a test drive\nInto retirement is all about having a plan that's built for years and years and even decades and so we don't need a test drive it because we can recognize in here and now what's going to happen\nCan't way mhm sure right we know that the market's going to have years of going up and years of going down we know that inflation is going to happen we know that\nYou're going to live potentially a long time or a short time you're living in perfect health your health we're going to deteriorate but we know all of the possibilities the trick is setting up your assets\nTo deal with all of the unknowns moving forward that's the whole idea of having a distribution plan a retirement income plan the ideas that we couldn't test drive it even if our life depended on it\nRight and I told the story before I'm a I'm going to tell her right now as of this trip that we made to the Steamboat Springs Colorado Steamboat Springs Colorado we flew into Denver and we rented a car to Steamboat Springs I have no idea I couldn't find it on a map is just so long ago [laughter]\nBecause and I couldn't see anything I mean have you ever been in a snow where you [noise] it's kinda like a fog but no fog it's just no and flurries and everything but my dad was a determined guy [laughter]\nHard working guy and determined and we were going to get to Steamboat Springs so we're driving through the mountains and I don't know if there were a guard rails on the road I don't know\nI didn't feel like there were and so mom was crawling underneath the dashboard and she was talking like we couldn't quite hear what you're saying is muffled because she was in a fetal position\nAnd at every Kerr she thought we're going over the side and the mountain\nNo it was too young to know the difference I thought it was pretty exciting [laughter] yeah but she knew that she didn't want to go over and she didn't know what was going to be around the next Ben was there with no draft where he is a ... car stuck you know she just didn't\nKnow what was going to happen and and a lot of ways that's retirement we don't know what's coming next a lot of times mistakes can be made if we just presume what's coming around the corner of well the markets always going to make seven percent\nWell you know what's worked for the last Twenty years is guaranteed to work for me the next Twenty years oh I have enough for retirement so I don't need to worry about it\nRight requirement industry says don't apply to me taxes always be the way that they are now and when we do that we wake up one day and were crawling under the dashboard and our car afraid of what's to come because if we plan for retirement\nBased on how the world looks today we're never going to get it wrong\nThat's right you don't want to be worrying about your retirement income plan while you're trying to enjoy

him with these ridiculous credit cards and high car notes and personal loans and damaged credit and they don't teach them what to do with the month off the mortgage and the Esther refund that can be funneled into something positive for the customer\nEvery dollar matters in my opinion on these situations because we want to reinvent their entire life we want to make sure that they are in the best on now in years to come so you know call this number see exactly how much you can save the average\nMortgage radio listeners say five hundred and twenty dollars per month when they picked up the phone

hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nAnd Sean just mentioned the average monthly savings for folks who called network capital at that number\nFive hundred and twenty eight dollars a month network capital use some sophisticated software they ran the numbers they want to\nKnow just how much they were helping people and it turns out five hundred and twenty eight\nDollars a month six thousand three hundred and thirty six dollars\nA year for ... for folks who called this number but that's the important part that's the part they can't do for you so I'm gonna ask you to take down this number wherever you may be maybe you don't need to do or ... maybe you have a friend and I should also mention that\nUh they do specialize in VA loans if you know somebody who would qualify and take this number down eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight of course John been talking about\nThe ten year but they do Fifteen twenty and of course Thirty years and that five hundred and twenty eight dollar monthly savings is on folks who went from a thirty or fix to thirty or fix\nCashed to cash out on their primary residence so let's talk about\nA term sell some people um you know they have no interest in shortening the term of their loan it seemed too aggressive and some people are really like the thought of saving you know if you do feel from uh thirty two Fifteen year\nYou're saving sixty five percent off the cost of your house and who should be thinking about going to a shorter term well\nI think a lot of attention I Know like you're never supposed to discriminate on a lot of different things in this business for you so you have to be fair to every different style of life for one thing I pay attention to you know whether it's wrong or right I look at the age like I really mean it means a lot to me like when do you want to retire like how long do you really believe in your heart that you honestly going to stay in this property\nWhether it's wrong or right I look at the age like I really mean it means a lot to me like when do you want to retire like how long do you really believe in your heart that you honestly going to stay in this property those things matter because you want to make it like a made to measure mortgages\nCustom fit in I like my suits made to measure from the ground up a brown every inch of me to make sure it's it's like you know that they always say like you're swimming in your dad do 'cause it's all big you know I feel like that's just your general mortgage out there it might help you in some aspects of life but it's not\nThe perfect lawn for years so what I Believe in is making it from the ground up around your income your credit ... what are your goals what you're looking to do how long you want to be in the home thinking big picture like we ask questions like what's up with like your appliances is there any big cash purchases you know you need to eventually make that it'd be smarter to pull the cash now while you're in the lower rate era\nCompared to where the market's moving we even talk about school like how the age of the kids\nThese things matter now when it comes to the shorter term person I was ... when I bought one property there in West Virginia I was like thirty one years old and I was thinking I don't want to paint on his things for the rest of my life so my goal is to do a Fifteen year fix and have it paid off and five so you know everyone has a different idea to me I like the raid break\nThere a difference between thirty and Fifteen year in those times was over ... percent and a half\nSo to me I'm like wait a second I could easily sling a slightly higher payment compared to what thirty year and I get to trim a hundred and eighty payments I get to see more noticeable results I get to increase my credit scores I'm In control and not letting the banks stretches out and milk me for every dime of interests\nI like building a security nesting of equity for a rainy day\nAnd the other day when you get that mortgage bill and you see the principal reduction it's going to put a smile on your face you feel like your money's going to something of value\nIn that value as owning more that portion of your home that's called home equity there's a reason they call it a home owner Tony home or so you know start with a call and look at shorter term I Will not tell you guys that every single call go shorter term because\nNot everyone situation is is to have this thing paid off\nSome people need the lowest possible payment\nSome people need to stretch this thing out some people need to get out of jail free card and here's your opportunity\nThis week the special deal is a ten year fix more and more callers are asking about the ten to Fifteen I like to tell you that they start with a tan and usually say yes to the Fifteen or the other side\nThey start with a twenty and say yes to the thirty 'cause they're really similar ten and Fifteen are quite similar twenty and thirty quite somewhere so let's find out what's the best known for you now in years to come and that starts with a call so swing for the five hundred and twenty dollar average savings the best way to do it\nCash out the pay off dead cashing out to do some home improvements maybe even stretching the long term out its case by case this number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said registering ... three point seven five\nTen year fix any four to six ape yard they're not charging lender fees they can do this in his little is ten business days now the balls and your record dial this number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nWe talked about it earlier it was in the new news homeowners racking up a hundred and forty one billion dollars in credit card debt to do renovations and as you said and that makes really no sense when you look at credit card interest rates versus home loan interest rates so if you've been thinking about\nDoing some home renovations maybe pull some cash that number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight of course it is the weekend and Sean what do you say to people who they liked the sound of this and maybe they they do want to call just to get\nA no cost benefit analysis maybe they want to call to find out if they could afford or a ten or Fifteen and they want and what their specific monthly payment would look like and by the way they can usually get you that information but Sean there but they're thinking I cannot deal with the paperwork so\nHow much of that can they delegate to their mortgage banker\nI don't blame them nobody wants to do a lot of work so we do have a lot of window shopping Theresa where they call and they just want to say hey like if I\nWere to cash out fifty thousand dollars you know does talk did away with my pain and be like could I still save money we get a lot of people just say hey I'm willing to invest two hundred and more on my mortgage like that means nothing to me that's not going to make or break me but\nHow much cash can I get if I spent two hundred more so\nThere's a lot of great questions week after week that people are looking into we we have people that call and they just want to see like hey if cache of a hundred grand to maybe go buy a rental property outrage what's that going to do to

that don't make the customer do hardly anything we really just want you guys call and tell us what you want some were let us go after this\nAnd the other day they make their own decisions over decisions over there and now we're capital like if they need to push the square peg through the circle per se they will so that's a huge advantage they have an advantage on the way they have an advantage on the ...\nThis one's over their network capital like if they need to push the square peg through the circle per se they will so that the huge advantage they have an advantage on the raid the of an advantage on the current times on their product portfolio the people behind the scenes were with us from start to finish its not like passed around like the game phone tag and in your story

I mean we're in the cash out world the cash out craze I mean this is when most people spend money so they love the idea of paying off dead like credit cards\nCar notes student loans collections it's a good feeling because not only do you get rid of that and get rid of those discussing interest rates but you've seen so much money you fix your credit you're in a better credit position so we can have
