have the right now my neighbor who they should give it to an century what the government do it they're telling us they're going to\nBasically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give up the choice and that's my point [noise] it's\nA good point too it's a classic illustration his reacting to the soundbites we play the John Case it was a ringing his hands and guilt over the fact the caravan is coming up it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it\nAnd it because we're not in it but could be ... except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls because God doesn't want that\nAnd we've got to realize that that was just plain lucky it's kinda like written Richard Gephardt doubt winners of lights lottery\nYou know we were just minding our own business one

basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never if they've never been in and they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world the United states poverty is not really poverty I got in trouble Everytime I point that out but it happens to be true\nOf statistically financially however you want to look at it but but the the way to look at these disparities is not to simply say oh oh that could be me and then the run around feeling guilty about it\nUm\nThe way to deal with this is not to run around constantly imagining well you know it was one\nAccident and I could have been in a caravan and then having that impact\nThe way you deal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion and lots of

divorced their father she's one civil actions she'd been a commissioner state house representative us representative and the senator\nAnd I look to other ... other than politics I Can't find where she's worked or or had a a career in anything besides politics she votes one hundred percent with the other far left us in the Senate\nOr website says that she's a true friend in fighter from Michigan\nWebsite says that she has a focus on job creation but she's never created any jobs\nThan Iraq Hussein all administration doesn't know how to go about doing that\nIn fact be Iraq was saying

center\nBut how was that what a school for\nI mean even if you're going to have girl diploma you should be qualified to do something while you need to go to a job retraining Mr Limbaugh this is true you don't understand this is for people who have\nWho ever worked and their jobs have left them their jobs have been moved overseas and they don't know how to do anything else other than jobs they were doing that Republicans have shipped over really so you need to build a job or read training centers\nSo if people show up and do what their reach trained to do what nobody ever tells us what three training is in there there's just a bunch of bureaucratic BS\nAnd the proof that they're totally unnecessary as the last two years\nJob retraining centers why even\nHave schools what the hell are they will say schools today where you're going to learn about women's studies\nGender studies climate change studies and all this other garbage that doesn't prepare you to\nDo anything but be
