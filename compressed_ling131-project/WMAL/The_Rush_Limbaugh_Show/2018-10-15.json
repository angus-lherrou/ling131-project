think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that his man made I Will say this um\nI don't want to give Koreans and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs\nI don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can go to Greenland march these huge chunks of ice just falling into the oceans raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nExactly and you don't know that it doesn't happen all the time anyway you don't know when it started you don't want an end and you don't know how natural it might be\nBut did you hear her say that the chunks of ice forming into the ocean or raising sea levels I remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing this in fact there are two things\nThe first I pointed out because I read it and the Heritage Foundation or action to report that this was during the spotted owl earth first a natural forest station controversy if it was all part of a global warming\nCraze in the early nineties and I pointed out that there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ... act our founding\nThe left when fatty they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we and chop down trees and we haven't replaced them to make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I pointed\nOut you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is\nThe woods the industry they need one right I didn't get what you have to grow trees it's not a finite resource and for every tree that's cut down\nFor a new ones were planted it's part of the policy warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to it that doesn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest\nMore forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two than it was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them because they don't understand capitalism or economics everything's zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want to cut down the redwoods never come back you know I'm the same\nToken I remember saying well it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more trees forested acres in America today than there were even fifty years ago\nThe second one was when when I um when I pointed out that are falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green is going to raise sea level I said it's like ice in a glass melting ice had just not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice cubes being jumped into the ocean and not going to raise ...\nYou're crazy it's crazy it's you know what you're talking about of course it's going to raise you know it\nDoesn't get a glass eyes and pour some water in it filled up still not glass in ice\nPut as much as you can and filling up with water the ice is going to melt you tell me what the glass overflow\nIt will not\nThe volume is the volume a bunch of ice chunks falling off a glacier\nAre in no way capable of raising sea levels it's too massive it's too big but it's all about they thought you know what you're certainly you're not a scientist you can see this\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's natural\nIt's too big but it's all about they thought you know what you're ... you're not a scientist you can see this\n\nTrump is right to say we don't know if it's natural or not but we sure as hell and not the ones causing and if somebody gave you the order okay you need to make ten percent of Greenland melt and have the ice formally what

all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over [noise] was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but let's say this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two they were there were two things that were portrayed in one was just the ... of what happens in those clinics but even more than that\nWhat was that

or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself\nThe numbers of children born alive killed by this man is stunning and shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less whether you're done they've always done their best to suppress it\nIt was nearly impossible to get this movie made precisely because of what it revealed\n\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future careers by taking roles people like Nick Searcy who um a is a ... and across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take or [noise]\nWhatever you want he travels to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major

specifically which one but they wouldn't allow any was\nFacebook would not allow any kind of a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all is actually kind of a lot of let's say amazing miraculous buddy if it was it was a a lot of hard work at a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nAnd it was a real challenge for maybe how how difficult is it\nTo focus on the fact that this abortion as did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of ah of abortions in the world but the numbers of born alive that this man murdered\nIt's just stunning everybody thinks late
