having here they are still\nAll circling and focused on the age old argument between conservative and liberalism and that is the role of government and people's lives\nAnd the answer to why people on the left are unhappy at great economic news is because they can't claim credit for it and it threatens their whole existence where in people are not capable of this and need to vote Democrat to basically live\nThey need to vote Democrat need to continue to vote democratic because only the government can provide for people only the government can help protect people against injustice

while the more independents success people have\nMore people rely on themselves get jobs improve their lives just the fact that Democrat Party gets mad that that is all anybody\nThe more people rely

party not upset about new instances of diseases breaking out we've already cured and they're not concerned about it\nBecause it is harmful if anybody makes the connection\nHow anybody can say the
