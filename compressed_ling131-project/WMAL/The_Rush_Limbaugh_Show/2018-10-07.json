six\nTwenty five loves to talk to you were talking about the demographic imaging and\nIts applications to breast cancer and a vascular problems within the body particularly in the head and neck which are very easily said also in the legs by the way it was said before the break that\nYou know this is not only are a female problem when it comes to identification of breast cancer guys unfortunately because of our environments we're seeing more and more men with breast cancer\nAnd the percentages the statistics are all over the place it depends on who you're reading and what their angle is on it but you know you'll see some authors said three percent plus you know all cancers today are\nAre male and some say well you're down to about one percent of all of them well and then the statistics that says one out of eight hundred one out of every eight hundred men will develop a breast cancer at some point in their life\nBut the bottom line is is that because of our environmental pollution semester genetics and the increase rate of prostate cancer as well that from a graphic imaging can\nGive clues based on blood supply and remember what we're talking about is they've done a vacation of a seat markers and that he markets have to do with blood supply inflammatory\nReactions within the body so when you see inflammation in a number of I always said information means acid ... acid means inflammation\nIt's really good to know where that stuff is in his identified you know somebody has a major headache you get somebody with a migraine and take a a demographer of their neck\nTheir face in their head and you can see all kinds of things\nAbout the head for a while you know you have somebody who presents with a bad T.

MRIs and other forms of diagnosis can give you a tremendous amount of immediate right now data without increasing your risk through radiation exposure to mammography\nRemember member graphic images of women that you that you've had them before they take that soft tissue that breast tissue\nThey crush it with about forty five pounds of weight and then they\nRadiate it and because of that you increase your risk of damage to that are very sensitive breast tissue\nBut in addition you know you increase your risk of cancer because the humiliation of radiation over a lifetime [noise]\nSo you know you uh\nThere's about a ... a ... many of them a graphic a sites will tell you the the risk of cancer in women is about one in eight over a period of a lifetime and they're talking a lifespan of eighty years plus so that's about twelve percent of all women out there but I guess what if you could catch this early\nAnd before he became a tomorrow became a duck to assist or an invasive carcinoma of any sort [noise]\nWhat age would that give you well this is opportunity this Wednesday evening the tent at the results center of feeling in Fairfax to listen to one of the best [noise] ah ... for his around does has been after since two thousand and eight\nAnd she has a tremendous tremendous background when it comes to diagnostics and she works with a group of very astute medical physicians that's all they do is they read these diagrams so she takes them she sends out\nA these guys read them and they come back very very quickly and the digital images indicate to them whether for a at other\nOr diagnostics need to be done in some cases they're going to say listen you know you need to send out for a mammogram but it's that's the last thing that they they want to push towards when other things like um our eyes and ultrasounds and combined with say\nThey want to push towards when other things like MRIs and ultrasounds and combined with say a demography scan can be extremely extremely impactful\nWhat bothers me is the fact that the the medications that you say that he's on and it increases because there's ... there's going to be some bleeding and the Brits infections that can you can have a you can have some infection you can have some bleeding or you know you can puncture the the wall\nA bladder cancer depends on the type of cancer that is can move very very rapidly in some situations\nSo but there's other you know again I'd have to have ... much more to tell you yes or no what\nBothers me is what they do about it you know people can guy with the faith with cancer and like not a guy that was something else\nWell that's good that's correct and and you know the thing that they're going to suggest and I don't know this is true I'm just going to give you some guidelines you know they may tell you that you know if there's let's say they they go in and they find cancer throughout the ... the bladder the first thing they're gonna want to do is to remove the bladder\nOr if it's a localized situation they ah they may do radiation a ... a type of of ah intervention\nThank you I didn't think it would be helpful and they live and I asked\nYou know there's a lot of them look him up anyway thank you for calling so I appreciate it a again based on his history in which you've told me you know he's got an increased risk simply because of the blood centers that he's on\nAnd it doesn't go without a side effects and somebody that of that age group that got to be very careful so the question would be asked why are you considering this to begin with and is there another way and what happens if we don't do it and why do you think that this is you know the the first line of intervention\nAAA six zero nine six two fathers triple late sixties zero Ninety six twenty five this Wednesday evening death painter we'll be your host as a result Center for healing\nAnd she's going to be talking about some graphic applications demography diagnostics and everything that they can be applied to I think you're gonna find it extremely fascinating join her a there is a is an amazing intellect she's a has\nA the capacity to look at things in ways that ... or others kind of miss you know she comes from a a tremendous background a again she's been at this thing or\nTwo thousand eight and she's been in our world and a healthcare since two thousand and three [noise]\nYou know she had a tremendously long career as a forensic psychosis a psychologist and then she went through some significant problems on her own and ended up with us lucky us ah she you know she's been aboard sort of as a certified demographer by the American College of clinical demography\nAnd you know she\nThis intuitive sense and many of you know her know her very well she has an intuitive sense a vats some people will never have and uh she presents a informational gonna make you think about it and if nothing more join her this month as breast cancer awareness month\nThat there was a senator healing this Wednesday evening as go the phones Alice how can I help you thank you for calling\nYeah I'm I'm sixty four ah my brain on the bottom of my faith especially hurts when I'm trying to sleep\nHow long has been going I'm Sorry how long have you been ... from Iran now okay four or five months what your blood sugars like sugar is fine I'm fat and sugar it's like an eighty or something um do you know everyone says\nYeah it it below a problem it's not at all and have you had any problems with your back any injuries any back pain remind pack I Do have some degeneration in my back\nOkay so the the uh the pain of ... really not any kind of blood sugar handling can come from a lot of different things the first thing that you look at is the neurological traction the low back\nThose nerves go and do your legs are going into your feet so at your belt line you have the nerves that go down in your feet so if those areas are compressor irritated then you can have this ... this Robin now so when do you sleep on your back is sleeping aside\nI sleep on about it on my back on my side do\nDo you feel more when you're on your back or feel it more when you're on your side\nSo what's happening there's the post ... ... a gliding points of your spine are called for sets\nAnd so when you would lie flat on your back off and those foot sets a flat and they pull and they they extend like telescope and if they're irritated if you have degenerative changes in there with a second it's called high perjure fee [noise]\nUh then in that position they can cause more irritation and reflexively cause pain all the way down and your legs your legs will feel sore or heavy they can hurt they can ask a put your feet\nThey can cause more irritation and reflexively cause pain all the way down into your legs your legs will feel sore are heavy they can hurt they can ask a but your feet can a burn or be irritated so that's the first place that I Would like the second place that I Would look wouldn't be in the vascular beds I Would see if there's any kind of\nIrritation information that is going into the legs and into the faith demography by the way it would show that up dramatically [noise]\nUm so you would take a look at that you would see if there was a blood supply problem or without that the next thing that you look at is how you would look at the ... system the bottom of your feet\nHow was the beginning and end of ... of some significant channels delivers on the big toe ah the kitten is on the bottom of thoughts you have the ah acupuncture channel for the what's called the bladder Meridian with by the way starts on your face and goes all the way down and ends on your little tow\nSo you have to rule out different systems but where you start with to begin with is that you look at the spine and if it's final it can be treated you would look at the blood supply and see if there's an inflammatory reaction coming from something and again once you have the answers of you know why is that whereas it coming from your country to directly\nSo those are really not blood sugars those are the next uh more probable situations that you would have to look at the great the classrooms attendance ones they even get a lot of data and they'll be have a few people around to be able to answer questions where he was well\nHopefully that's helpful Alice thank you very much for calling appreciate it AAA six zero nine sixty five [noise] you know the thing that we forget is that the the low back controls everything from the organ systems within your abdominal area all the way down in uh the nerves in the muscles of your feet\nAnd we have to be careful that we don't become an optic you know that we don't look at just one area that we expand our vision and look all the way through that's the beauty of of demographic image in particular you have a full body demography it can show things that are going on and where they're coming from\nAnd that's the clue that's them the most important case so this Wednesday evening there at the painter we'll a\nPresent a very interesting uh uh subjects on thermal graphic imaging the alternatives when they should be used with other traditional forms of diagnosis which is really really important you know we're not saying that this is the only way to go it is a\nA an additional way of diagnostics is a a\nIt's a complementary piece it's not something that necessarily needs to be separated from but when you have\nA the ability to have some sort of early detection in any real earlier when I was starting to form the blood supply that ultimately become significant one it makes sense to at least find something out about it\nWith the pros and cons I this is not something that replaces mammography although some women choose to do that this is something that is used cooperatively is read by very ... very educated and a medical physicians that that's all they do\nSo it's important that you do your homework on this stuff and so why not start by listening to somebody who's had ten years of experience in doing demographic imaging and working with some of the best doctors that ah that's around but remember\nAnytime you do a mammogram you know there are side effects to mammograms as we said earlier you know a mammogram shouldn't cause a bruising or any long term side effects but sometimes they do [noise]\nYou know like a any X ray mammograms exposure to radiation and if the ongoing effect of accumulation radiation\nYou have your your uh your breast tissue or any other tissue radiate it and then you know you have some other area radiator then you have some other area irradiated your body holds on to that radiation you know can mammograms or spread cancer\nWell if you go to the national Cancer Institute\nThey'll tell you that you know that the compression you know the the squeezing other breast tissue on getting the mammogram cannot cause cancer to spread [noise]\nMy brain says this if you break the the uh ductal area where the cancers is hiding or sitting and you smash that area and you smash any the lymph nodes that are in there\nAnd some of them are more sensitive than others and there's just this may running through my head space and letting you know how I think there may be some problems I'll let you use the guide given brain and things to that mammograms you know require radiation\n... you know they're telling you well you know the benefits outweigh the damage the harm maybe do they again this is something that you have to make a decision that\nSome cases you know a MRI is used you know\nKnow uh and breast screening well much safer in my opinion than using a mammogram and then if you combine ultrasound and you combine demographics damaging your your false\nBy now we all know the number one cause of chronic\nRight now we all know the number one cause of chronic and intractable health conditions is information\nInformation causes a decrease immune response that can lead to cancer cardiovascular disease against when resistance and the gender the loss of muscle and bone\nOr did you know the number one cause of chronic inflammation is lack of sleep multiple studies have concluded that stress short sleep cycles hormone and balanced low blood sugar chronic pain and environmental issues like ambient light caused mostly

no idea how much they're going to need to save for retirement so you can see right away why retirees do that so many problems Kelly how much thought our people putting into how much they're spending is going to change in retirement\nAnd I think the problem is not many people by thinking about this at all as a matter of fact you know people are focusing less on the expense side and more kind of on the communication and making sure that nest eggs growing instead of thinking okay when I retire a month from now five months from now two years now whatever the timeframe I'm going to give up my paycheck\nAnd at that point I'm going to need to really focus on you know how much I'm going to spend and I need to know where that money's going to come from\nI mean that's really what people should be focusing on but not many people do which is a little surprising to me\nI guess I'm not complaining because that's what we do and that's how we help people take care of it but you know many cases people are either going to work less they're not going to work at all and so either that salary goes down or goes away and so you've got your necessary expense and you get your discretionary spending discretionary like eating out traveling\nEither that salary goes down or goes away and so you've got your necessary expense as you get your discretionary expenses you know like discretionary like eating out traveling hobbies you know you bucket list kind of things but getting a handle on those expenses that's what's really important and that will answer some really big questions that people haven't retirement like can they make it\nWhite on returning welcome back\nI'm ... and former here with Kelly Campbell you're listening to ride on retirement forever twenty seven years now Kelly and his team at Campbell wealth management had been working with people just like you creating financial strategies to help\nThem get to and through retirement and successfully Kelly is here today to help you enjoy your ideal retirement Kelly lift his medical and health expenses as\nThe jumping off point for a little deeper dive into retirement expenses that we all have what can you tell us about this particular line item on the extent she\nYeah it's important thing to look at because there was a government analysis that was done that found that expenses dropped for most people in retirement in all categories except one which is the one you brought up medical and health expenses\nSo people are justified and they're concerned about him because not only are they going up but we don't necessarily know what's gonna happen to another was a lot going on with health care in general like the cost of health care the cost of insurance costs of Medicare\nSo the question is you know where's that going to settle out\nBut anyway household expenses for health care and medical care average about thirty nine hundred dollars per year right for those in the kind of fifty to sixty age range but five thousand dollars for folks between sixty five and Seventy nine year range so that's a jump of almost thirty percent ouch [laughter]\nThat that's a big number thirty percent increase so that goes up and you've got to plan for that right expenses in other areas of drop so I mean that's good news but the cost of health care and medical care high and you know they're increasing it a much higher rate than regular inflation to\nUse that an average of about five thousand a year for people's sixty five Seventy nine and that's a little bit low and then there's other surveys who say that health care retirement could cost as much as two hundred and fifty thousand dollars for a sixty five year old couple who are retiring this year I've seen that one a lot which is a huge number how\nDo you account for this in a retirement plan Kelly\nWhere you really have to start planning now and I always say this is never too late or too early to get started because a lot of people say oh I'm already in retirement I don't need to do any kind of planning already there it's too late for me hey it's not too late it's time to get it done because I'd rather put things on paper now and find it out I Would say that people\nHave run out of money in retirement do you want to know now or when you run out\nNow yeah I'd like to know now so if you could\nPut it together you know the worst thing you do is do nothing but you know thinking about creating a budget evaluate your overall health in general you know and if you do not as healthy maybe you should say okay let's budget more money towards my healthcare start researching Medicare and what it will and won't cover you know just so if you're going to be in that situation where you going to need more medications or if\nYou're gonna need more of the care you know you'll be able to account for that as well but then look at the different options that you have any plans available and you go to Medicare dot Gov to get some of that information\nThey really do have some pretty good information on there as well there's a guy called Medicare and you and it's a really good guy it's actually pretty easy to read as well I've printed out accomplish pretty lengthy but the beauty of it is that it's fairly easy\nTo read and fairly easy to understand as well\nBut that all comes into play when we start talking about\nOur writer retirement financial trio show again I'm offering this today\nFor anybody that has five hundred thousand dollars or more invested for retirement and they want to really find out where they are and they want to make sure they're in the right place but just give us a call at seven I was three two one five two to five to be one of the first time caller and we will set you up to come in\nAnd we will actually do a write in retirement financial tree is it no charge for any of it but it's a really good way to you for you to find out if you kind of had it in the right direction if you're on track and if you're probably going to stay on track is really the important thing so give us a call today it's Seventy three\nTwo one five two to five two and we'll get your set up for your right on retirement financial tree ...\nThis is right on retirement with Kelly Campbell presidents and CEO of Campbell wealth management image over twenty seven years of experience\nIn the financial services industry Kelly's been featured in a US News on Fox Business and the NBC said today you are getting some valuable wisdom placed upon you check him out on our website Campbell wealth dot com again Campbell ... dot com\nThey were talking about making sure you know where your money's going to go into retirement was talking about health care and medical care and how we need to pay attention to that is but what about longevity because we know that\nHas to play a factor in retirement and as our health care continues to rice you know we are all living longer so this could be a problem how people plan for living a long long line along retirement maybe forty years Kelly\nThat way and that's a great question because what we're finding which is really interesting is that people now are looking at their parents in what I say hey you know we take all of our clients financial plans out the age Ninety five it used to be I guess\nWe're in finding which is really interesting is that people now are looking at their parents and what I say hey you know we take all of our clients financial plans out the age Ninety five\nIt used to be I got a lot of people that would say Ninety five oh you live there like you know Seventy five right\nNow we're getting people are saying well yeah Ninety five may not be long enough my mother's actually Ninety four or my father died in Ninety two and so for some of those people were actually take 'em out to one hundred\nBut that's the part that's important is that goes into the planning process in other words if we say that we're going to put a plan together for a couple or an individual and we're going to take 'em out to Ninety five what that means is we want to show them mathematically that they're not going to run out of money before he's Ninety five\nIt's a matter of fact we want to show I'm Still having plenty of money after Ninety five as well so the further we take that out and we take it out to one hundred that means or monies last longer and that's really what we're focused on\nSo your question is a great what how do you deal with that longevity the first part is to put it in some kind of financial planning program because if you put it ended up plan and the plant says hey based on your current investments assets your income and in your spending habits\nYou're not going to make it you're going to make the eighty five but you want to play in the Ninety five what that means if something's got to change you may have to spend a little less you may have to choose from different types of investments\nBut the beauty of it as you can start to make those changes now\nAnd put yourself in a much better situation for down the road it does work but it's something that needs to be focused on in something that needs to be included in some kind of financial planning model\nThat when you take your clients through this financial ... showed that mathematically how their money is going to laugh how do they feel\nOh my gosh you'd be amazed by some of the reactions you know I'll say this nine times out of town I find that people are going to have enough money but they're in good shape they're going to have enough money but what's really interesting is even though they are in good shape a lot of people don't think that way right so\nRiver we said the beginning of the program we said you know people just aren't focusing on these things what they're doing instead of focusing their remember they're just looking at the nest egg in general you know need accumulated need accumulate\nBecause they don't know but when they do know and when they say hey wow I'm In pretty good shape it's such a relief to them and that's when they say you know what I Love everything you guys are talking about you're giving me the confidence that says I'm In good shape it I'm doing the right things or\nI'm In good shape but as long as I make these changes that's really what that financial planning ... is all about and that's why it's so helpful and that's why people like it so much\nYou know none of us know how long we're going to live so that's not exactly in our control and other thing that's out of our control as inflation up here clans battling ... end up for grabs and that eroding a portion of their retirement savings [laughter]\nYou know that's interesting that people have different ideas on inflation right some people say I think the inflation is going to be really high some people say it's going to be really low but we had a guy that came in probably two years ago and hit and those pause plan he was an engineer\nHe had great spreadsheets it was really incredible as a matter of fact he knew I think he wrote excel he wrote that perhaps because he knew so well but at the bottom line is he had all these spreadsheets and one page led to another and you know it just really like embedded programs going one to the other and things and it was is beautiful but he didn't put in place and then there\nSo we had all the models worked out but he had no model for inflation and so he said hey you know Mr Campbell I you know one disease kind of take a look at this but I think I'm going to find you know looking at everything I'm doing I can retire tomorrow and so I basically looked at it and said well okay what's your inflation rate you use and he said what I said what seemed ...\nSays oh I didn't have unemployment rate oh no [laughter] so I said well that's a big piece you're missing and that's where that can really blow up your plan that's where it can really get to go off the edge where you haven't planned well enough because his favorite this way so let's say you're spending a hundred thousand dollars a year this year\nAnd next year inflation goes up by three percent well that means you need next year a hundred and three thousand\nTo buy the same exact things that you you bought this year\nAnd if it goes up by another three percent just add three thousand each year right than a hundred and six seven hundred nine hundred and twelve hundred and Fifteen so you can see that going up fairly quickly\nAnd if you look at other factors like you know that's regular inflation but what about health care or health care has been going up by a lot more than that so you when you really start focusing on that inflation rate and you put that in the planning what you'll find out is that while you may need\nHundred thousand today you may need two hundred thousand ten or Fifteen Years from now just to to kind of keep it going with the same level expenses have today\nAnd things like Social Security that does have an inflation factor but not a great when there's a kind of things you need to think about but that's also where our financial planning ... comes in so or write a retirement financial tree eyes is a great program to help you look where are you are everything you're spending everything you're doing to make the right decision for your retirement\nAnd if you're already making those decisions as to how to verify that you are making the right decisions so for the first ten cars today if you say five hundred thousand or more\nGive us a call now and will set you

financial tree arch its are right on retirement financial tree as program will take it to the whole process no cost no obligation but it's a good way for you to get to get a handle on whether you're making the right choices are not so just give us a call to partake in that\nThe number seven to three two one five two to five to again that seven to three two one five two to five to\nWith a mortgage and that live on a fixed income you know both those things come into play so that's where it becomes important to start looking at those things because maybe you need to think a little differently about having so much money into the bank and I'll tell you Lou and lately we've seen people with literally hundreds of thousands of dollars sitting in cash\nSitting on the sidelines of the biggest thing I hear I didn't know what to do with it [laughter] I was worried about the stock market I didn't know what to do with it\nSo that's where I kind of our planning process comes in and that's why we are for this today so\nFor the first ten colors that are say five hundred thousand dollars or more that really want to go through a planning process to really want to find out where they are are they making the right decisions should they be thinking differently or they're making the right tax efficient decisions are there things that they can do that will put them in a better situation from an income Sanborn going in retirement\nThese are the questions we can answer with our writer retirement financial tree out so get the one of the first ten callers to our number seven to three two one five two to five to again give us a call Seventy three two one five two to five two and we'll get to set up to go through a write in retirement financial ... process\nI think you'll get a lot of

A. M. P. B. E. L. L. well dot com\nYou know we don't all have a good graph of you know how we should generate steady income in retirement when we're not receiving regular paycheck I think a lot of it is because people don't even get a pension anymore right\nYeah there are a lot of people don't get a pension now in our area it is a a lot of government employees a lot of a military so a lot of folks do get pensions here\nBut you know they're not always the biggest pensions and not everybody does get them so if you don't have them or maybe it's not enough to cover all your expenses what you want to be\nFocusing on or your investments in others rumors that the thing we talk about all the time it's that three legged stool you've got pensions if you have a Social Security and then the backdrop or your investments those are all the things that are going to provide income to you and retirement and that's what you really need to be focusing on so if you don't have\nA pension you got to make up for another areas but starting with income planning that's one of the most important things you can possibly do is have some kind of written income plan that says the day I leave my employer and give up my paycheck here is where my money's going to come from\nAnd we do that for every client because we feel it's really important to you know from day one when I started this business I said you know it's important to be factoring in why people are investing and for retirees people close to retirement income is the key\nSo you need to build a plant around income and unfortunately most people don't have it every one of our clients does which I'm proud to say that but let's take some work I mean you really got to make sure you focus on a fix you put it together\nBut that income plant will help you determine exactly where every dollar you're going to need a retirement will come from and and you mathematically proven make sure you're going to mathematically make sure that you're never going to run out\nKelly with guaranteed income in mind tell us where Social Security fits into retirement planning and how you can maximize those Social Security benefits\nThat's a great question too because when we talk about income planning income planning and I said that second leg of that three legged stool of income is Social Security but they didn't say when to take it and that's key 'cause when you start focusing on when I'm going to take incoming how I'm going to take income the beauty of it is that kind of structuring it the correct way\nCan lead to hundreds and hundreds of thousand dollars more in your income plan or in your assets\nYou know before you die out a lot of people say well you know hey I don't want a lot of assets when I die I Want to spend my last dollar my last day well that'd be great if you do when your last day was\nMost people do so Social Security is an important piece but remember everything was so security falls around what they call your F. R. A. your full retirement age benefit for most people kinda nearing the retirement age right now is there a sixty six are pretty darn close to it but what you're focusing on with that is if I take it at my full retirement age I get one\nNow is there a sixty six are pretty darn close to it but what you're focusing on with that is if I take it at my full retirement age I get one hundred percent of what I'm supposed to get if I take it earlier than that which is as early sixty two I'm going to get twenty five percent less\nNow if I take it later if I wait till after age sixty six read or write full retirement age for every year after all the way up to age Seventy I'll get an eight percent increase in eight percent guaranteed increase\nIn that number so that's why that such crazy planning becomes really important to me to watch your overall I\nMean that's why in that financial planning tree ... right so a write in retirement financial tree out program we will actually go through that with you and help the kind of understand how to take Social Security why did take it early why to take it late what to do with it\nAnd that's all part of the planning process so get if you want to take advantage of coming in to see us be one of the first time caller to save five hundred thousand or more of invested assets for retirement and costs seven oh three two one five two to five to seven oh three\nShe won five two to five two and we'll put together a right on retirement financial ... which will help you look where you are all the different assumptions going into what's going to happen in retirement\nIncome asset since Rachel return tax rates and inflation rate and how long you thinking of running around and we'll build a plant around that to help you determine are you making the right decisions are you in the right place and will you retire effectively and efficiently and with confidence\nSo cost now seven to three two one five two to five job and get your financial ... now\nKelly was shut last how their retirement bucket list expenses that into the retirement spending equation coming up next you're listening to write on retirement with Kelly Campbell Afghan\nWealth management Don retired were jelly gamble [noise]\n\nYou often hear retirement called the golden years\nBut it is when it comes to your health it's clear you consult your doctor word right why not consult for professional when it comes to money just like your doctor's advice you get from a financial advisor to have a direct impact on your quality of life are you paying too much in the with your current financial professional what could happen to your nest egg if there's a market correction\nYour insurer about the answer these questions it may be time for a second opinion Kelly gamble as an independent advisor doesn't have a boss on Wall street Kelly in the ...

he has opposite is right here in D.C Kelly has been a leader in the financial services field for over twenty seven years now helping others get right on retirement and that is why he's here today\nAnd we've been talking today about where your money goes in ways to help you ensure that you will outlive your savings Kelly I'd like to talk about the mindset shift that has\nTo happen when you stop working and then you enter their retirement world can you explain the difference of the accumulation phase and then the withdrawal phase once we're in retirement and why it's so difficult\nYeah absolutely so think about it when you're kind of investing for retirement you know you're working basically your entire adult life are into that income putting money away on a regular basis and then at some point what happens well the income shops and all that you said is there to take care of you know or hopefully there to take care of you\nIf you put enough away right you've been in Cuba waiting for all these years\nNow it's time to withdraw and that's a different face it really is and it takes a different mindset it takes a different investment philosophy everything kind of changes a little bit so it depends on your particular situation on what changes but it could be that hey I don't have a\nA pension and my Social Security is kind of small so I'm really depending mostly on my assets so it's also a time when I say that folks\nYou been working for your assets all these years now that you're retired your assets need to be working for you so it takes a different planning structure different planting thought process on how to start taking money out of your portfolio rather than putting into your portfolio\nAnd you know it seems like one of the real benefits working with the financial professional like you Kelly is understanding that shift in mindset I mean that's what you do making our many grow like it did while we were working doesn't make a lot of sense once you're retired because you have to protect it or not\nIn mind that I mean that's what you do making our many gross like it did while we were working doesn't make a lot of sense once you're retired because you have to protect it but not all financial professional specialize in retirement like you did so tell us what kinds of qualities should a person to be looking for when they're trying to find someone to handle their finances\nYeah that's a great point because a lot of people don't understand the withdrawal phase of retirement so you could have one of the best most season financial advisor been doing a great job for decades for their clients but they don't know how to actually take assets out for retirement\nOr legal advice you should talk to a qualified professional or making any

N. A. L. more Washington comes to talking\nWelcome back now here's some more conventional wisdom that you bring the man on a mission to retire American one version that\nHe will go\nBack to do on the radio show in the first segment we are talking about\nGoal setting in about a a video that I watch today a by some guy that just doesn't look like he's what he thinks he is a which is a personal business coach because he's saying things like uh don't set a realistic goals don't set to many goals less is more focused\nImportant at all he's talking about it say how to get across town from my my job today I mean this is unrealistic is what the pool was all about\nYou had been given a set realistic goals from your childhood don't do this don't do that they'll play in the street and get hit by a car all this messaging you got your entire life leads to a life of quiet desperation think about the lives that we are told during our entire life don't play in the street\nSo you tell your kid do play in the street what are you done\nYou've taken away their ability to get anywhere because now they're afraid of the street when the truth of the matter is you walk out on the screen you can play it at all you want as long as you looked you left to look to write because cars only come from two directions and you watch for big noisy things coming at you then you can play in the street all you want\nWell the same thing is to take your money and put in a four one K. and put it I re because it's safe and you but what you've done as you've taken away the vehicle you've taken away the vehicle to get to where you want to be like to be wealthy successful financially you can't put your money and if or when Kate in Iraq so you've been told your whole life to do these moderately\nEasy things so\nYou go through like you go through college because if you don't have a college degree can't good a good job so then you go and you get a good job now you're working\nAnd and you're saving ten percent of what you are in the five percent of what you are or whatever\nNow you go out there and you find yourself a spouse and you get married and now you have to go out there by yourself house this expected abusive now go and spend your money on the house and a car now your card house broke and then you get yourself a baby and then you get two babies and three babies now you have a baby broke\nAnd then you raise in these kids in your life is miserable you get up every day you go to work and you're suffering you have a miserable life you come home and after the ...\nAnd then you're raising these kids in your life is miserable you get up every day you go to work and your supper and you have a miserable life you come home and\nAfter the boss gave you crap all day long you come home and the kids give you a crap and your wife gives you crap until you got to do all the stuff you don't want to do and you're tired and you're busy worn out but you can't do any of it and you know your kids loved you until they get to be about fourteen after that\nThe older they get the dumber you get and so you have all these things going on your life to make your life miserable but every day you got to get up and morning go and drive for an hour to get to work and then work all day long and drive for an hour back\nAnd all this time your money's already know money you're developing no savings you're not getting any closer to being retired and you realize you have to do this for the rest of your life and then it happens\nRight it's just you're you're almost nervous breakdowns at this point what you do is you need somebody you love you 'cause nobody else was loving you and so you get yourself a dog and the dog loves you and you come home you got somebody loves you problem is you've got to pick up its towards in the backyard\nSo he's ... crap everyday to now now you got more people give 'em your crap and you do this for thirty or forty or fifty years then you get to the end\nAnd you go I did it a\nCop pushed what I set out to accomplish I did what the plan was to do I got the kids through college they're out of college\nWe're empty nesters don't really know my wife anymore we really don't have any type of relation\nAnymore but we'll we'll get it back ... back now which she sold that you know I don't really want to look at her I'm so out of shape that I really can't do anything if I did and you know we'll get back we'll try to live sixty five years or like the next five to ten years\nOf our elderly lives\nExcept for one problem we don't have enough money to do that so I'm going to have to continue to work part time\nOr or if we do have the money retired just barely enough and we will not be able to travel the world because we don't have enough money to travel the world we're just going to have to live frugally and go to dinner at four o'clock every day to get the seniors discount [laughter] right that's life\nAnd that was well late plan that was a serious set of goals that you had for your life\nLike there are mediocre what\nGood is to set goals that are mediocre this guy is so crazy so out of it\nHe's teaching the same lies everybody else in life teachers which is less is more don't set unrealistic goals wow manned\nBy the way don't set in more than one goal right like you shouldn't have a goal that by the time and during my entire Thirty years working I could stay physically fit that I could create and maintain great relations with my spouse that I have a great set relations with my children\nThose goals are too many you can't have them all you got to get that money that you can retire with you've got to get that forty years of work under your belt you got to have that big house and you become house poor you need two or three car gene for college degrees little Billy can't even read or write and he's going to college because that's\nThe goals that were set up I guess my friends you have a set of goals and there will be they are realistic aboard you really want him\nJust because you can be wimpy doesn't mean you have to be wimpy or that you should be wimpy\nYes we all have the capacity to live a mediocre life a life of quiet desperation we all have that capacity but does that mean we have to use that capacity does that mean we need to live down to society's\nStandards I don't think so I\nFirmly believe that you need to shoot for the stars you've got to go for something big hey I'd rather go for something big and not get their missed the stars and hit the moon than to go for something moderate that I can achieve\nYour way better off right so\nTo do that we go back to the questions you have to ask the right questions how do I retire in five years not in thirty five or forty or fifty years you have to have a timetable and it has to be an unrealistic one\nAnd that's what people do when they come to latch I'm going to retire and five years or less\nYou have to say I want to retire making more\nTaking hold more cash than I take home from my job I don't want to retire because I'm living poor no I understand that I make a hundred thousand dollars a year but I only take sixty thousand dollars a year home\nThat's all I take all and that's what I live on after taxes and my four one K. contribution and everything else that comes out of my check so what am I going to do I'm going to take home sixty five thousand dollars a year of tax free income and keep it all\nThat water one sixty five thousand dollars worth because I Want to do better than what I did it\nThe dollars a year of tax free income and keep it all\nThat water one sixty five thousand dollars worth because I Want to do better than what I did at my job I took um sixty now will take I'm sixty bucks\nSo I've got these financial goals but at the very same time I'm accomplishing these goals of the next five years I Want to lose twenty five pounds and I want to keep it off\nAnd I don't want to do something I don't enjoy to do it so I'm not going to doing starvation diet or joined it but what are you stupid diet programs I'm going to learn\nNow do you expect your family to get anywhere financially when you're making less than one percent on your network\nThat's a very scary thought to try to figure that out how you think you're going to get rich on that or are you going to live off that even if you had an eye network the only made half a percent or a tenth of ... percent I mean you're talking about they don't even have a percent return and they have a tenth of a percent return\nIs what you're looking at now that's about Ninety percent of the people and then some people have some investments see another ... another five percent to six or seven ... seven more so you're up to like Ninety five Ninety six Ninety seven percent and they're making somewhere between\nOne and five percent return on their network\nAnd that's because they've employed this capital to do something\nRight now the problem is some they might even be making deals to make a hundred percent return on a real estate deal but that a hundred percent then is divided out across the\nEight hundred thousand dollars with a network than it doesn't really mean anything because it's a very small percentage so they have lowered this return even though they're out there doing stuff that's very successful investments\nBut they've lowered the rate of return on those investments by having too much actually\nSo the number one thing that kills an investor is dead equity that's money sitting there doing nothing what are the worst culprits the worst culprits are your personal residents your four one K. and your IRA now I Know you think that you've got\nFour hundred thousand your IRA or your four one K. I'm Sorry you don't\nBecause you have to give up half of it to take it out even if you wait until you're six fifty nine and a half you still have to pay your income tax rate on that money to get it out\nSo you don't have what you think in there so it's really kind of delusional you know you're thinking wow there's things making me money but it isn't\nBecause you never got it if you don't get the money you are earning the money this is something you have to understand until you earn money and get it where you can spend it you have an ... say well it's on a piece of paper called my four oh one K. and I see that number is on that piece of paper getting larger sure and they will in 'til the day they don't\nAnd that day they might go backwards on you\nSo you can't say well I was up to five hundred dollars and now I'm Down to three hundred thousand so but I made the two hundred that no you never made the two hundred thousand guys\nThat's the problem you're not seeing it for what it really is you've\nGot to get that personal residents which you got four hundred thousand dollars each person of your life savings in that house what does it or knew nothing\nDo you still have to pay taxes you pay the mortgage but did you start to pay the taxes yes you still have to pay the insurance she asked you still have to pay for maintenance and repair yes you still have to pay ... you know get to spend time and money to ... ... whatever that maintenance I guess all of that stuff\nBut you haven't earned a dime by paying it off none if you get sued and it's not your personal residents say it's a rental property they can take it away from you it's just the thought of paying off the house is so common yet so\nIgnorant in every way shape and form there's absolutely nothing logical about paying off your personal residence other than this and this is the one logical one and that is you got so much money cash to invest that you can make the income that you want to make with the money you have liquid\nAnd not need the money in the house but if you cannot make with the cash you have available to you enough income to retire and live the way you want then that money sitting in your house is killing you know let's talk about the guys on the radio the other day he bought nine houses over four years\nAnd turn around and look back and say wow they're all good deals ... we did really well in each one of them\nBut for years later he's got eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nEight hundred thousand sitting there let's do some math let me get up to trust the phone here let's do some ... just to show you what I mean Iraq he's making four thousand a month for a thousand times twelve making forty eight thousand you're divided by eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nHe's making six percent return to see what I mean now\n... thousand dollars of equity he's making a six percent return to see what I mean now what did he invested all those houses he probably invested less than twenty five thousand house will say twenty grand house\nTimes nine was come up with that number just sort of the difference what he thinks he's earning or what most people think they're already twenty thousand times nine\nHundred and eighty thousand dollars now take the the um four thousand times twelve forty eight thousand a year to buy to buy a hundred and eighty thousand and he thinks he's making\nTwenty six point six percent return the numbers he's calculated it and the numbers he shared with us was that kind of return in the twenties high twenty returns he thinks he's making twenty six percent return\nBut in reality he's making six percent return on his family's network his network than those houses is eight hundred thousand bucks\nHe thinks it's a hundred and eighty 'cause he's not counting all the dead equity it's just like it's not even there\nJust like you're paying for all that money is not even there\nIt's just kind of thinking guys that keep you for\nWhat I Want you to do first of all I Want you to figure out if you want to make any money become rich and retire early that's a first step but if you do then what do we need to do that we need to get on top of where your money's going to come from to invest\nOr do we have enough to work to start with without doing anything he just got money later I Will do that that if not where's the next easiest place to get the money to cost us the least to go get the money\nAnd we'll take a look at those options maybe it's borrow from your four one K. maybe it's liquid ... four one K. maybe it's a liquid that your IRA maybe it's refinance and cash out refinance your house\nYou got rental properties maple refinance and pull it without a baby it's time to sell them and move on to something larger like an apartment complex\n[noise] those are the kinds of decisions we have to make about your financial position before you even start making a move because if you start small and collect pedals are going to end up with a bucket full petals and you're never going to own a rock\nIf you want to own a rock you got to figure out how to go buy a rock and that rock may mean you have to trade in all your bubbles remember monopoly for green houses and then turn it over to a hotel and then three hotels yeah that is monopoly that's what we're playing it like\nThe same game Mars is called my short break you right
