lifted veil how to get your brain back how to make it work again but more importantly you need to know what the triggering mechanisms are and that's where we're trying to go over today\nThis Wednesday evening seven pm as a result Center for healing is going to be doing just that is going to go over this in detail and give you some options and how to reverse this thing and how to get your life back\nSo much of this is in fact the ability to change things that you have control over before they get to the place where they cause damage and this can cause damage we talked a little bit about no transmission and now that it does affect them and get more into that and just a little bit\nBefore we do that I Do want to go to the phones Marion thank you for calling how can I help you\nOh hi I'm going to I went to a lot of people do about the new polio like but I don't know if it violates that cap and you can find information the newspaper anymore you know on the TV screen and it could mean accepting of kept\nIt should be a ... it's the it's called the F ... for short and it is it's something that has been around for a long time and it's something that shows up but it doesn't have a tremendous amount of widespread\nA contagious application it is not transmission of transmissible from person to person\nOh I thought it was like what am I can tell you know if they if they can pay\nCan now it it uh it can be you know one person to another may be spread by um a mosquito or flea or some other things like that uh you know depending on which virus they're talking about and it's it's a multi dimensional viruses not just a singular type of thing [noise]\nAh ... as we you know been told on the news media and scaring the heck out of everybody is that it is it's sudden and then you end up with weakness in the lens ... muscle control a ... it's not fun and you know particularly when it hits younger people they can go into you know respiratory failure and so forth\nSo paralysis that takes place is real the the fortunate part about this is is not as prevalent as everybody wants to make it look like\nA it's a you know again you brought it up as a polio uh like presentation but it's a it's a non polio was cut an interim virus by the way\nThat they had a very new and they didn't know how like that for twenty states but we can go I don't know how many states\nNow that's not necessarily true like many other things that are put out there that have are half baked and have true [noise] uh you know it's a strain of a respiratory virus and once it hits that respiratory system you have some problems\nYou have over two hundred different viruses that you've been exposed to in your lifetime and a lot of them are just linked into your your genetic map your DNA\nAnd the reason that they ultimately have the ability to lock in and cause symptoms of because your immune system has crashed so we're seeing more and more people with a more susceptibility today simply because of the fact\nThat they're not eating the way they're supposed to they never go outside the vitamin D levels very low they eat so much sugar that you know uh they're being susceptible to all kinds of things as we said you know one teaspoon of sugar decreases your white blood cell activity activities off of the ability for it to work\nBy eight percent for twelve hours and if you look at that and you have any kind of virus of bacterial pattern or fungus or mold that comes by and you're exposed to it and you got to sugar too sweet tooth\nYou got a good shot of having that kicked Ken so if you want to keep a then the viral patterns under control and and I'm I'm including the flu or someone to segue a little bit in what you're talking about\nYou know you have to make sure that you keep your score but your vitamin C. levels high tech things like echinacea you increase your using 'cause I'm going to get rid of the ... the the sugars out of your diet\nOr get a little bit of exercise keep your vitamin D levels adequate and high and those should be tested at least once a year by everybody so you know where the ... were were were cave dollars we don't go outside anymore and in to that extent ... immunological responses to all kinds of things but the the symptoms\nCame dollars we don't go outside anymore and in to that extent ... logical responses to all kinds of things but the the symptoms of this polio like a virus and you know it's also called DVDs uh sixty eight I've just I'm pulling up the CDC website right now\nProcessing the way it's supposed to know when we get into trauma and blows and injuries\nAnd you know we don't think about it oh it was just I just bought my head but yeah bumpy your head and then you bumpy had again and then you compound that onto stress patterns where you compound that onto bad dietary patterns and now you have a major issue\nGive us a call AAA six three zero nine six two five Dr John ... let's talk about a ... what happens over a period of time as you neglect of this you know how does it begin manifesting I led into that little bit but I I really want you to touch it what happens when the head\nContinues to be foggy you know we don't move into the direction of clarion it\nYeah so what happened is the same as saying we want to find the cops we won't know what a cause that burned fog if you cannot as you cannot have on their cars ... and ... for example a you have some uh fifty issue so just like I said you drink coffee and not who do you have very bad habits eight\nBy you ... you don't buy you don't take what we don't think so I think it's good you secret by three ... a lot of people ... a staff of our late at night and also also um they they don't have enough sleep at night and they feel are tied in the morning\nAnd also there's the doctor said OK you Rio Rio so some people said okay I I don't sleep at night I can make up in the day\nAfter his told her raw you cannot have ... on the city with a knife in the day even though ... says the ... Madison\nSo all we always to because I have my and tries to manage the education practice in China for eleven years uh I always combine the two together to analyze what's going on there for you keep it out of the brain fog going in former times managing your ...\nYour ... your ... your kidneys will pathological stopped death amongst the in the way they're supposed to because it brings up\n... ... ... is the is the most common most commenting on symptoms they can they function\nAs a very interesting so you better start explaining to our listeners oh yeah because otherwise I'll do it for your\nHeart January and I didn't get it done times ... with top on their on their own game taught channels that akin is the foundation all of the body\nSo um do you not get foundation so Ken the whole kinda got hold of the energy conclude that she and the life of forced labor as a possible energy on a ... year old ally for its high over if you don't have enough energy on ... and now your brain cannot look at it and you can get a get Tony fight\nThe brain ... don't have enough and you turn the ... and ... avenue to function\n... is from another um medicate Madison to explain what I have heart a word oh why oh get at the brain fall\nSo let me make it real symbol for our listeners that they can I mean there's many different reasons why you're talking about I was hoping that you were going to touch upon the\nKidney is in Chinese medicine is the life force in the body and the western society we call it the bodies constitution the internal strength of how the body works so that it's ... there were just exchanging words for something that means the same thing\nBut here's the situation so if the kidney energy\nIs depleted or we started seeing kidney damage or trauma\nOne of the reasons in our society that causes that in his very straight across the board or people who are dehydrated yeah don't drink enough water yeah they're not flushing the toxins out they're not they're not clear and the kidneys kidneys build up with a lot of poisons and and so forth and even kidney stones and debris and so forth and those\nFrom a western point of view those toxic elements that can't get out of the body make us feel extremely sluggish tired I a brain fog yes right\nYes also the the seek out the ... and also or walk Walter mix up other seven Seventy three all of their brain the brain has along the water\nThey Seventy percent of the brain Brent yeah as water is water yes yes I have a comment but I'm gonna keep Atari stuff yes there's a few people that I like to use that analogy with but I won't do it [laughter]\nSo Seventy three percent of the capacity of the brain is water is water yes and without water we know that ... or anything that's a lead trickle can't a function properly and we know that the brain is electrical\n... you can ... is is another way to explain why the killing of ... can cause a brain fog Bernie phone try and keep it going to destroy a ...\nSo what do you tell a patient with that you tell them you know you're not you're dehydrated you're not drink enough water and they said but I I drink tea or coffee all day long isn't that liquid\nOh it's a nuclear bomb however I don't I don't drink coffee\n... no no coughing why why because the coffee can just do you remember we talked to San Antonio ... may and this spring chemistry with the caffeine kind of slow it down the ...\nWhy because the coffee can just do remember we talked about San Antonio's dobbin may and this spring chemistry is the caffeine kind of slow it down to San Antonio a law to an adult in may and an increase the conference on\nCaught on to get the stress ... hard as all cultures um yeah it's a stress can cause of the cause and go out and they can fly and the fight your body of are very nearby either stature is always in the fight and fly team\nIs kind of relax that's a lot of people would come to a clinic said okay how stressed out ... low back pain because that's just the ... muscle muscle pull out there what it costs me alignment\nSo what is it which I'm going to go back to something you said earlier yeah because you said that which we know doping Maine if it's inadequate levels of doping mean\nYou're going to feel depressed ... worth it if you don't have a ... no value no no about value so the more coffee uh drank the less worth you're going to have [laughter]\nI think so [laughter] yeah it does is yes so all your coffee drinkers out there you want to start having some trouble you you ... you start you want to start having some value about who you are give up the coffee drinking water\nAnd ... and ... green tea is very ... and ... actually adopt an age\nOld thing you're going to the ... good luck Floyd yes that's the choice to\nDrink [noise] this was the evening the twenty fourth of the month seven pm Dr ... is going to be presenting an amazing eating series is one\nI'm having a lot of fun right now with with this topic but the truth of it is is that brain fog is a symptom a logical representation\nOf things that can become progress really severe in your body and if you don't get it you're going to have a problem you're going to see things deteriorate over a period of time you're going to the memory loss you gonna see cognitive patterns they're going to be a declining\nYour ... your capacity to do things in wanting to do things you're you're certainly levels are going to go away the value that you have a who you are as being also and we're just talking about the emotional pieces but these are real emotional expressions\nBased on alterations of neurochemistry all these neurological signaling components in your body and allows everything else to work the way it's supposed to work this one's

M. A. L.\nAllowing welcome to write on retirement with Kelly Campbell C L and president of Campbell wealth management based right here in Alexandria I really am former Kelly it's great to be here with you again as usual\nWhat has been going on with the stock market this past week or two something happened in the [laughter] I\nKnow some of those days you don't want to look at the market right earns and things but you know we've had the volatility which we haven't had nearly as much\nBut a lot going on with interest rates right now and and uh you know we do think it's going to settle down we think you know the smart is still has place to go but this is exactly why you have a financial advisor\nCause you finish advised can help you through this situation can help you think differently and understand why this is going on but more importantly what it means to your portfolio and your strategy and and at the end of the day your retirement\nWell because of this big drop that we saw last week on Wall street um we have an interview with David Baake keys financial educators he is in New York Times best\nSelling author and one of my colleagues sat down with him to talk about how it's going to impact you in your retirement is an interview that you won't let a mess and that's coming up later in our program\nYeah that's great I actually spoke to David Baake a couple of weeks ago I was at a conference and a and spoke to him at length about markets and some of the things he's got going on and he's got this meat program a it's a workshop for women and it's called smart women\nFinished rich and we're going to be doing that will try and get it in this year but it might be first quarter of next year\nOr so we will do be doing a workshop for women based on that subject but yeah just talking to him by brings a lot of a lot of great clarity around these subjects are so I'm excited to to have his um\nHis a conversation with your colleagues on our program I think it's a great great value to our audio\nYes and again it's something coming up here in our next segment you won't want to miss it uh in the meantime we're going to be talking about how to address major risk to your retirement assets obviously\nOne of the market right but Kelly you know when our children were little how you had to take them and for all their shots and everything to help them help protect them against any diseases\nSo that they can have a long and healthy life remember doing all that right oh I felt bad oh\nWhen my ... you know when they get their first shot you just build rubble but they have to add to that today you're going to help us and you're going to give a strategy is to help ward off the major risk to our financial health and retirement so Kelly where do we begin with the whole risk assessment\nSo that is used to help ward off that major risk to our financial health and retirement so Kelly where do we begin with the whole risk assessment\nWell you know it's interesting it's just like those doctor visits because I remember when my kids were having them you know you'd go in and the doctor would say\nDavid wealth and we are thrilled to have you with us today\nThanks for having me on your show let's talk about that and eight hundred plus point drop or the Dow Jones we know that rarely happens due to just one event so set the stage for us here what sparked a sell off\n... well it's a handful of things first of all on and so the question becomes well is there anything specific that's going on and I'll give you a handful thanks for\nThe first thing is that rates are going up and you even heard the president talking about this well let's break it down what does that mean when you hear rates are going up and that is raising rates the fed to actually been raising rates really since two thousand and Fifteen but\nMost recently the fed raises rates on the money to base can lend they called the Federal Reserve fund rate to turn a corner that happened in September and\nWhen those rates went up a couple of things happened first of all the costs to borrow money goes up right so you're going to borrow money for a home\nIf you're going to refinance your home if they're going to buy a car and you're gonna financed that car or you're going to use credit cards that matter anything we're we're you're borrowing money the cost to borrow that money is now going up and that's books\n... spoke some market right because of your home maybe people will buy the buy less homes or they'll refinance her home last so they'll buy less cars or they'll shop less when it costs more to borrow money the markets can spoof that consumers will slow down on their spending and so that's the first thing it's really been a story about\nThe fed and rates going up now we have to put down a little bit in the context because let's be honest rates have been really really really really low like you know we've had historically low rates for well over ten years and those historical rate which the fed put in place after our great recession\nWe're successful that's what got the economy going again and that's why we are right now enjoying what is the longest bull market in history so you have to put that in perspective um and they're all some other things are happening that are influencing the stock market which has as rates have gone up the Kenya treasury\nThe rates have gone up on that right now and that's the highest rates we've seen on tenure treasuries and like seven years so that's also a very interesting thing that's happening\nAnd then there's the fact that the tech market hasn't ... let me see if we see a sell off in tech stocks particularly tech stocks though I'm like Amazon and Facebook and that's not all related interest rates there's been some data breaches\nWith companies involved like Amazon a potentially data bridge and Facebook's had a recent data breach and so there's been some soften these tech stocks but again making putting that in perspective\nIt's been the tech stocks have been driving the market hire\nCompanies you know we call him saying companies like Facebook and Amazon and Netflix and Google these main tech companies have been absolutely on fire in terms of growing and they've been the stocks been driving the market hires the fact they pulled down a little bit I'm not that surprising it was probably you know about time for\nUs to see tax Sox pull back and I think the third thing that we know is affecting the market is actually the global markets that the trade wars um\nThis talk of trade war with China is having an impact and it's been really having an impact globally the global markets have been really down compared to our market like the U.S economy has just been on fire we have been\nCrushing it we've had the best stock market in the world um and so we you know us pulling back a little bit compared to what's happening abroad um it's really been\nA lot less like abroad the global markets been down emerging marked down and we've just been doing great so I think it was sort of time for the U.S markets maybe take a little bit of a pre there to an almost a recognized that things are slowing down globally partially because of the fear of these trade wars with China\nDavid I'm going to go back to those rising rate I Know that they can spell trouble for the overall economy but aren't higher interest rates are really good for retirees\nWill you know you're exactly right they are good for retirees is special retirees by the way who pay down their debt right which is something I've talked about for Twenty years the fastest way to to reach retirement early is to pay your debt off so if you reached retirement and you and you don't have a mortgage payment you don't have a car loan and\nYou're probably not using credit card or to borrow money if if you're doing one retirement than the good news about race going higher is that the rates on your money market and your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and if the most retirees\nMoney markets in your checking account and CDs and again treasuries are going higher and\nIf the most retirees live off of the income\nThat their retirement money produces\nSo the good news and I think they're actually a lot of good news I think I think before you know we will see tenure treasuries 'em over three and a quarter to even three and a half percent and there's talk that\nThe tenure treasures could eventually get to four percent in the next Eighteen months and all of a sudden we have rates again that retirees will be able to look at it and go wow you know that's pretty good I can I can live off of those\nThose income checks and so I think it is\nFor retirees it can actually be a very positive thing\nWe're speaking today with nine time New York times best selling author David by well known financial educator about the recent market dropped I Know people listening who are in are nearing retirement David they want to know is this the beginning of a market correction\n[noise] so I should pull my crystal ball right now [laughter] it's funny 'cause because here's a nobody knows right ... ... what I what what I Know and and we've been talking about this and maybe you know I've\nDone other interviews on this um I Know that we're we've we've just had the greatest bull market of our lifetime I I Know that have you been in the markets even after the recession hit and even after the markets pulled down if you just stayed the course today you have more wealth than you've ever had\nAt the same standpoint the last two months I've been telling people don't get greedy [laughter] I like I don't know it's not time to get greedy now is not the time to get complacent so it's very important if you are about to retire or you're already retired\nIt's very important that you're not taking too much risk with your money because if you're in your fifties in the markets pull back you can't afford to take the time to let the markets recover but if you were retired [noise] your\n... your comfort level was seeing your money drops significantly\nGoing to be lower so it's really important I I just can't stress enough that\nWhen you're approaching retirement order or you're already retired that you talked with a financial advisor that you work with a financial wise or if that if you have a financial wise right now that you pick up the phone and instead of paying attention to the news which I don't recommend you do all your financial advisor go back into their office\nSit down with them have them walk you through\nWhat you're invested in a lot of people who are retired that might be fearful the stock market today I\nActually have a very well we call very low exposure to the stock market like army people who are retired and they're worried about the stock market and\nHalf of their money isn't an annuity gave him a guaranteed rate and half of their money is and bonds and they've got a small percentage of the stock market under so uh but they read the news and they are very fearful so don't be fearful find out find out how much money do you actually have in the market how much risk are you taking and again I\nWork with your financial visor I just a big believer that\nA a working with a professional ... which is what we recommend people work with a\nRegistry investment advisor when you work for the financial wise or the the most important part is that they do a financial plan for you that they get they get to understand what your comfort level with risk is and then they help you build an investment portfolio based on your goals\nAnd your comfort level with risk if you have a very low comfort level would it take any risk well then you should have less money in the market um but the key right now to notice when markets are pulling back the most important you can do\nIs just call your visor don't panic sits still don't do anything every market pullback ultimately has had I Can't promise it will always out but I can tell you it's always had a recovery right every single major market pullback\nUltimately has had a recovery and so I'm just a big long term believer that you wanted diversified portfolio high quality investments built off of financial plan working with a financial wisely you can trust that's there to hold your hand when it gets like this right now which is this is a rocky parts market\nDavid fantastic insights on this market prop one silver lining here and all of this\n[laughter] well I think the silver lining is how incredible when economy we have right now like let's not lose sight of that now look at some of the numbers right now the lowest unemployment in America in forty nine years\nUnemployment's at three point seven percent right now\nWhat is that why is that because we have an incredibly strong economy right now so GDP which you know two years ago nobody believed that you could get to three percent well most people certainly did GDP right now the first half of the year three point two percent\nThere are predict shows or the third quarter\nCould be as high as four percent so the economy in the U.S super strong and things really are very very positive which is why by the way also we've had stock markets hitting\nAll time high so just notice things the economy are strong\nWhich is why but we also we had stock market it ...\nAll time show just notice the economy are strong this was a very long time to see a pull back in the market if anything is probably the that we're seeing a pull back in the market right now and just know the economy's doing really well the tax cuts that huge impact\nAnd for the first year will future we seen economy that's Kenya link to\nTwo one five two to five to we will put together your own right on retirement financial tree ... which will actually look at everything we talked about for a minute and complaining standpoint including that tax peace and Italy will even look at whether you're going to have that Ross conversion window timeframe where we can actually\nHelp you convert in the most efficient manner so again give us a call or text the word plan to seven oh three two one five two to five two and we'll put together you're right on retirement financial tree I was playing\nWe're so glad you joined us today this is right on retirement with Kelly Campbell Campbell wealth management Kelly has ever twenty seven years of experience in the industry ... Campbell wealth management their clients are so important to them in fact they're like family\nAnd social mission is to enhance the quality of your life as well he's offering\nYou a chance to call and get this right I'm retirement financial ... go through that\nFind out about your retirement are you on the right track do you have\nAny gaps and he'll help you come up with a written planned you've got to have it written down it can't just be something that you're just going through haphazardly all three of retirement check out their website\nCampbell wealth dot com C. A. M. P. B. E. L. L. wealth dot com Kelly is there anything else that we need to know about taxes and the risk that they've ... retirement assets\nYet Louis and I think the important thing for people to realize is that they're not necessarily going to be in the lower tax bracket retirements everybody says oh you know put the money away while I'm working that way when I go to get it I'm going to be a lower tax bracket during retirement\nNecessarily the case it really depends on what's going on with the tax rules at that point but you've got to think about your investments in your assets and we're going to be taking that income from as we talked about before you know where you're going to get it from tax deferred accounts um where you know you may have a fully taxable\nAmount when you pull it out or you're going to get it from a taxable invest when the cameras can be more like capital gains from the sale a stock um you know are you going to get it for cash where it's really you're not earning a whole lot but you're going to be taken it out of your cash assets and and that's really where\nYour source of income ... going to come from but\nAny one of these things has a certain tax treatment to it so and I remember when you start to think about your mortgage your mortgage if you have a mortgage Everytime we haven't paid off your house a lot of our clients have but if you have and you still get a mortgage interest deduction for that now the new tax rules have changed things a little bit and I do teach that and my tax\nClass we talk all about the new uh Trump tax plan and how that's changing for two thousand Eighteen and gonna change everyone's tax return but at the end of the day look on line to go to Capitol wealth dot com you can see one of them are actually teaching the class as we can go some detail about that but remember\nIf you are going to itemize deductions and you do have you know house interest that you're that you're paying that is one of those deductions that you're going to check that and property tax and mortgage interest again those things when you combine them could mean a lot of tax savings does say goodbye or MDs what are you start taking your required minimum distributions of Seventy to have\nThat is fully taxable but let me tell you one thing if you mess up and you don't take that are empty it gets even worse because as a fifty percent penalty that's five zero fifty percent penalty if you didn't take him and require distribution so you want to make sure you get that one right as well um and even Social Security when you start taking Social Security there's a whole different level of tax\nAssociated with that it's taxed differently than\nOther assets another investment\nUm or income sources are going to be tax so\nSo all these come into play so when we're doing planning for class we want to make sure we know exactly what's our tax structures and we want to put them in the best plan possible\nKelly that's great information on taxes because we all know that is going to be a big expense in retirement what other expenses that we need to be ready for\nThis is the important part and it's actually number three mistake is not knowing what your expenses are so it's not even the expense themselves but not knowing what they are putting in combination because you could find out hey I thought I was going to spend less time actually spending more or you know I thought it was only\nFifty percent of my pre retirement expenses but actually it ends up being eighty percent so everybody's in a little bit a different situation and that and those numbers change as well so we actually do something with our clients called the twenty four months checkbook drill miss the easiest way to find out what you're actually spending\nSo you do you go on line to your checking account\nThat we're getting everything at the end of the day flows through the checking account even if you get credit cards mortgage\nSoul written the euro always writing a check at some point to pay these things off to go to your checking account look at exactly what your expenses are for every month free twenty four month period of time in other words what at what or how much money is coming in\nIt was off she'll go to your checking account look at exactly what your expenses are for every month for a twenty four month period of time in other words\nWhat at what or how much money is coming out of that account each and every month to do that for twenty four much put it on a on a spreadsheet or sheet of paper\nAnd all those numbers up in a divide by twenty four now you know what your monthly expenses are and then you can look at it and say okay well what's going to change in retirement and then you can make those changes so if you're going to but they pay off your mortgage you can say okay well the principal and it's just part of my mortgage will be paid off so you can take that off\nRight but it makes it it starts to make a lot of sense and that's where when we start to do planning for people that's where we start because we want to you know garbage in garbage out we want to have the right numbers when we put together someone's\nSomeone's plan we want to know exactly what they're doing exactly what they're spending or what they think are going to spend in retirement so when we when we meet with someone and we're going to do there are right on time or financial tree ... we want to know their expenses we want to know their incomes and then we build a plan to be able to take them through their retirement life\nSo if you're one of the first ten callers today\nAnd you would like to participate in our right or retirement financial tree ... which is going to help you look at everything you're doing from retirement planning standpoint and make sure you're going to be OK makes you you're making the right decisions just call or text the word plan to seven oh three two one five two to five too\nAnd we will put together your own right um retirement financial plan\nUnderstanding how much you need and retirement is key to making your savings laugh to find out how to determine exactly how that works coming up next you're listening to write on retirement with Kelly gamble Campbell wealth management\n[noise]\nYou often hear retirement called the golden years but it is\nWhen it comes to your health is clear you consult your doctor board right so why not consulted professional when it comes to money just like your doctor's advice you get from a financial advisor to have a direct impact on your quality of life are you paying too much in these with your current financial\nProfessional what could happen to your nest egg if there's a market correction you aren't sure about the answer to the question\nIt may be time for a second opinion Kelly gamble as an independent advisor doesn't have a boss on Wall street Kelly under the table wealth management specialize in designing retirement strategies that can allow you to spend more time enjoying life less time being concerned about your finances maybe it's time\nFor a second opinion seven zero three two one five to two by two thick Campbell wealth management can help make sure your building years are just that golden seven zero three two one\nFive to five to seven seven zero three two one five to two by two [noise] Hi welcome\nBack on ... you're listening to ride on retirement\nWith Kelly Campbell Kelly is president and CEO of Campbell wealth management based here in Alexandria he's been featured in the u._s. news on Fox Business even on CNBC and he's an author as well he wrote the book fire your broker and he has twenty seven years of experience he's here today to help you get right\nOn retirement date we've been talking about major risk to your retirement and now we're just talking about how you have to go back and and kind of look at your past twenty four months you call it the the plenty for much checkbook drew okay that's yeah twenty four months check but drill you get an average\nHow much you've been spending every single month and then you know kind of you know what your expenses are going to be in retirement and you need to stay on a budget because in retirement you're on a limited income right you're not really making that paycheck anymore so here's the question Kelly how do you defend yourself against emergency is\nThat's a that's a great next item\nOr so when you start thinking about when you have an emergency that is our risk number for not having an emergency fund or that easily accessible cash\nAll right so how much are we talking about ... so that's the question we always get everybody's got a different number on this might be take is that you should have three to six months of living expenses\nBut I hear everything from you know three months to a couple of years\nSo it depends on your situation you know in other words if you had a pension well you may not you know let's say guaranteed pension from the government you'd probably not going to need as big of an emergency fund so maybe you're more like the three four or five months\nIf you don't have any pets you knew really rely on these assets British all the income that you need even if your Social Security kind of low then you may be the one that needs more like you know say six months to a year year and have something like that you know but this is remember what this is an emergency fund is a cash account that is easily accessible\nYou need to be able to get to it very easily be able to get cash\nOut of the paper expensive a lot of people don't have that set up or you know they're saying oh but I've got that home equity line I could reach onto we don't want to go into debt for emergencies we want to have that absolute emergency fund so that you don't have to worry about where that money is going to come from right now it needs to be there for\nThings like that car repair that dental procedure whatever it's going to be\nBut not only does it help you determine where it's going to come from but it also helps you kind of prevent that that panic that you could have like oh my gosh I Know ... you know this big march\nDoes it help you determine where it's going to come from but it also helps you kind of prevent that that panic that you could have like oh my gosh I Know some things\nYou know this big march happened where am I going to have the cash from so it gives you that peace of mind knowing that you've got that cushion for the unexpected\nOr hey what if the stock market value drops and maybe you were too little aggressive in your portfolio you could actually go to the cash to to get some of the need is you're going from an income standpoint versus having to go into the market which is down at that point so\nAgain you always want to be looking at it that that income amount that you want you have a goal and if you say okay it's going to be six months for me then you always want to keep her punishing that as well so if you spend it\nWe are not permitted to offer and no statement made during the show she'll constitute tax or legal advice you should

being on the team now officially compared to just being one of the members who's helping other members all the time\nOr you know it's a providing a little more structure of my life I definitely have to carve out a little more time before it was almost like either a friends or are people that I've met along the way would say hey can you help me with something and so it was very sporadic but I was happy to do it any time somebody asked\nAnd now that we've made it official and we have our vast members out there that no that that's my job to help them I get a lot more phone calls and I'm a little

with me here today is um Mr Scott Ben Austin is the latest new is the most current\nMultifamily mentor Houston market area Scott's been with the lifestyles for a long time on stubborn apartment complexes going after a few more right now and has been helping people deliberately even before he was on the mentoring team so Scott I'm going to ask you probably the hardest question to ask any mentor\nAnd I don't know sixty days enough for you to come up with a robot answer but maybe just you're eight years of helping people's friends throughout lifestyles may give you a good sense of where I'm going with this and that is when I bring new mentors I say ... you know how you grade yourself as a mentor\nAnd [noise] it's really difficult because you know they say well I Want to grade myself that no one ever has failed deal and you can err on that side by saying OK I'm just gonna say no to everything the easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything you'll never be wrong\nNo one will ever come back at you and say you are you mad you were wrong and that's what I lost but but the other side we have the other kind of mentor Scott a we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come the right word for it so it's not insulting up there\nThey really really really really really want\nTo help you get what you want to the point where maybe they're not using enough of their own personal um among\nConservatives notice to sign them from making yeah restraint and and being able to as you look I Know you really want this I Know this one really ... you know you really like this but there's quite a few things\nThat you know the red flags go up there in the back of my next going up this just doesn't seem like the right deal for you [noise] um [noise] you know there's that balance in the middle where Ninety nine percent of the ... people put your deals end up doing good ones the other one percent of people that don't listen to how to do it why don't you tell me how to do it [noise]\nUh that's the perfect\nAnd then the final indicator is okay how many people by retired and make millionaires out of that's good that's a good score card\nAnd how many people that I've consulted it become national park association winters so I haven't had this conversation with you yeah because you've been so busy since you got here and I've been so busy last couple of weeks also have you thought about any of those parameters constraints as to how you would grade yourself personally\nAs a consultant ...\nI really haven't thought of that you know you hit on a lot of things there that\nOh you would grade yourself personally as a consultant while\nI really haven't thought of that you know you hit on a lot of things there that I have seen it sixty days and I thought about sixty days but I hadn't thought about the overall kinda\nWhat do you want your legacy to be a deal and and this and what I'm doing now [laughter] um I can tell you that when I Am working with people and I've done this and this is part of the lifestyles culture that we try to kind of pushed through and when and\nIf if you talk about people who are doing exactly what we doing syndicating deals by deals whatever outside of lifestyles so many times I was in this conversation yesterday\nThose guys make all their money up front on fees and things for putting that deal together and they really don't have a vested interest in what the long term successes of any particular deal\nBecause we invest in every deal that we do in addition to taking other people's money I really look at this and and Curtis does a great job in the multi family orientation session of talking about the family office and that's kind of a new thought that he put in my head\nAnd really figuring out how to maximize my net worth and in effect grow it and so\nI look at every deal that way whether or not and that now that I'm a mentor and so the two smaller deals a mentor people on there were no brainer sin and when I mentioned before sometimes you got to give them a little shove off the cliff\nThat's what these war they were first deals for these folks but when I looked at him it was like guys if you don't make a decision to do this I got twenty other people behind you that I Know we'll do this today and uh and then eventually jobs and they're going to be great [noise] um the hundred and sixty\nFour young mother will always got Scott ... you're just so you have the ... that are using the today\nI called the cattle prod mood you know you got what do you do with someone won't take actually hit him with the ... what does that and I used to say it all the time is if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm going to give it to somebody else but we're not going to let this would get away so I've always called that have cattle ... move okay a\nHundred or a hundred and sixty four unit deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper now says it wasn't so obvious a good deal [laughter]\nUm and we we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips unfortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very smart very good at at analyzing the numbers and uh we got through that but it took a little bit of work\nThen that brings us to the the one that I'm working on this afternoon which is the out of town deal\nUh this one doesn't help that it's not in the Houston market where I've been act or\nYou know active for ten years now and I pretty well known sub markets and things like that there's one I had to do a little homework on\nAnd when he first brought back as an initial analysis I found some things that I thought he was trying to favor the deal a little too much and I did have to pull him back and say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage some of that we've gotten a more farm alone quote which can substantially affect the deal\nAnd so we're going to take another run at it this afternoon so I have seen a little bit of the spectrum I guess and how deals develop I haven't had a deal yet ah we had one on a a acquisition road trip that a few people were pretty heavy on and I did I we didn't get very deep into it but I came out on the\nRoad trip and I said the skills to rich there's not enough\nUpside to this deal to make it worth a while and we and we pulled a couple of people off of that deal um but fortunately we didn't get all the way down to due diligence and get everybody's hopes up to invested in the deal but that's that's the biggest problem sometimes you get people that are doing first deals and they're emotionally\nInvested in them and it's hard for them to let go and and that's where I Do see my\nKind of position here is to make sure that people don't get a little too anxious\nOr lose some patience and make sure the good deal comes along because it took me\nNine months before I got my first deal under contract and I was completely blocking the gray line between unemployed and self employed for those nine months so uh I was definitely anxious and Emory a Jacob had to hold me back from doing a bad deal at that time so I've never forgotten that\nYou know I remember during your rise and so forth you were you an interesting personality your personality fears and nothing\nBut yet you're very analytical and I've had conversations with you and you know after our conversations where it's been like man the worlds coming to an end and we better be careful and then another conversation with you you know and I'm going to go do something way out here over left field but we've never done before because I just think it's interesting that my my really pay off\nSo you you got a lot of ah versatility and your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question though and that is this um about a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember a time flies you know the last\nCouple of months ago on very quickly but we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you were kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know I'm really kind of the point where I might not do any more deals\nSitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you're kind of pulled back saying you know I don't know a really kind of the point where it might not do any more deals and uh I might just start by Partridge out and and you know changing my position more like yours dealt with ... more of it\nAnd then I look at it you're you're you're working for the day a man you got like one new deal you just closer to more deals you going after\nWhat did you do do do do consulting changes that we had to go to a break subtle what you had just talked to a break but I'm just wondering did you take some new go Joe Jews are you taking your your new vitamins or was helping other people got you back out there going\nMan the market really is good right now let's get go into was holding back if you guys want to ask a specific question our number is eight seven seven seven eleven fifty to a lab and I will leave ... open\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country and then the concept came to us for the first time ever that you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units I'm not a good guess but it's a lot of properties a lot of units\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in bald taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would it be like to take the money\nAnd the sophistication and the experience that we've accumulated in this group and take some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or\nWithout being insulted it leads to have less experience than we do and to be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the Texas market area\nAnd ah you nailed one we've had four or five others have gotten nailed in the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people coming to road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston and Dallas in San Antonio and going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to Phoenix and going\nTo ah you know all these different places we had these deals\nAnd there are now saying we opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I you know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated to get\nAbsolutely so ah and you're absolutely right and my wife and I are first two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was where best opportunity was so we moved there for a little while\nBefore we moved back to Houston and\nBeginning of last year I had went on a big junk mail a campaign and so I started on subscribing to all these things that creep into your mailbox overtime for signing up for various things and I sit on the couch with a a a football game or something on she was on the other end of the couch down whatever she was doing on her laptop\nAnd I was an subscribing and deleting all this junk mail and one of the things that happened they are a which is one of the big brokers here in town and they are national\nOr had gotten bought by Cantor Fitzgerald\nAnd when that happened I had been on their website and I had set preferences so I only got deals and the Houston metropolitan area at the time that I started doing this I said why would anybody have to leave a city like Houston there's so much opportunity here to do any of this and I had I stated rule that if I couldn't drive to it and be home\nBy the end of the day I didn't need to own so ah anyway as I'm sorting and and I didn't batch to lead I was just hitting delete delete delete scrolling through the subject lives beset fanatic deal pops up and I went huh and I clicked on it\nAnd I very quickly from looking at so many deal sized up that if this was in Houston, Texas there was a no brainer and they would sell for a lot more than the price was on this a posting that I saw [noise]\nAnd so yeah I asked my wife what do you think about buying this deal out of town and we've got a business excuse to go fly up there a couple of times a year and see all those friends that we left behind Twenty years ago when we came back to Houston\nThat she sent out whatever you want to do if you want to manage outside but it means that I've\nNever had to do this but I'm probably gonna be gone at least one night a month going up there just to make sure everything's still running right and she said asked by the hour or two girls were out of the house by this time and we just have one kid left there\nSo things are manageable if you think tried to it so we ended up doing it [noise] um I went to my three a kind of largest investors that have long term vision and I said guys this little bit of a flyer but boy you back you know the steel and they were all in\nAnd we did the deal's been phenomenal the ah we bonded since August of last year we're on pace to return Nineteen percent cash on cash and our first year of ownership Brennan interest only period so things are obviously cash along really well but it's a fifty five and over high yield play a property not not a\nBrennan interest only period so things are obviously cash along really well but it's a fifty five and over high you'll play a property not not a a value play that we're having to fix up\nAnd we kept saying management group in fact it was a it was run and we're really well so I saw no reason to shake things up up there we put it a little bit ... we're making it even more efficient so that when the principal kicks sad or cash on cash probably won't have to do\nWill just a cover it with our increased threats that we are getting out of this place [noise]\nSo uh that's a great place I was actually up there about three weeks ago I guess and they really wanted one of my investors who was from Battle Creek Michigan founded the lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to invest they wanted him\nAt the Detroit road show that you guys had about three weeks ago and he couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and help out and really kind of tell his story at how we met down here and now we're investing in other markets up there and\nI got to tell you a J. B. data Durham had a phenomenal presentation and not only walking around Detroit we were staying downtown walking the streets at ten thirty at night from a restaurant that we went out to like for the event and\nI went into Detroit with a bad attitude and walked away completely changed they've got a lot of metrics that look really good up there\nAnd I think they are probably a pretty well poised to to have some great things going on and we have members as as you said that found the show uh most of them came down to Dallas and so it was the closest place to fly into her drive to\nAnd I did their their studies they invested in some deals there and now they're doing deals in and around Detroit Michigan\nA border take that off place to take a break right there's got to come back we'll finish up on Detroit and the other national stuff you've been working on the right back Scott Ben off during the ... radio\n[noise] why do you have how long [noise]\nListening to the ones we radio will be back with more trees reports opposed to just\nYou know that every dollar you invest in real estate makes you money's five wave cash flow of money in your pocket each month equity capture some\nSounds of dollars you create when you have the right team and by a white property using the right mass appreciation real estate can increase in value overtime equity fill the rents are paid down your mortgage each month and finally the tax advantage when done correctly real estate investor pay no taxes\nOn our cash flow and capital gains lifestyles unlimited these are the five ways we make money in real estate which is why real estate accounts were more millionaires in the world today than any other investment vehicle you should have some real estate in your portfolio to learn how to attend a lifestyles unlimited\nFree workshop called eight six six Ninety seven one eighty nine Seventy four go through lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com and register for the ... that eight six six nine seven one eighty nine Seventy or go to lifestyles unlimited workshop\nDot com\nYou have to decide I Will you get it right now is a little over ...\nBack down the question here you shell you can connect with down off the air down your radio dot com and click on my\nLaptop now\nSays we'll be able to\nMultiple levels of words that are completely different one and then for Damascus\nWe know you're out there hiding in plain sight\nLiving a life of quiet desperation wondering if you're going to beat your money to the grain there's a better way a better life and lifestyles unlimited it's time to live the life you deserve you can only do that by creating passive income let a show you how it's just two hours it can't be worse than another meeting about meetings or another mine last night in front of the TV\nGotta lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com that's lifestyles unlimited workshop dot com\n[noise] by Adam ... owner of valor roofing fall we want to thank you for making valor one of the most hired and trusted rivers in our area valor roofing is built upon the principles of honor respect and trust and this week for police to root for payments as low as Ninety five dollars a month\nTo get a free upgrade HD architectural singles or things to you\nAll seven three seven to one forty nine thirty one to schedule you're free to come in\nAnd check out our latest craze a roofer ...
