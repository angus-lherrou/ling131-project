rest of the drive by claiming the White House is calling the shots behind the scenes and expanding the scope of the FBI's inquiry\nThey question about the for a vote on friday live turtle we have is not much of a turtle the turtle for for the turtle he was on fire moments ago last night and just now McConnell\n\nAnd what in fact one still does first grab audio soundbite to visit well let's play number three let's let's let's set this up this was yesterday me\nOn my own show this has got to be stopped because it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names value walked the FBI to talk to investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads and when they don't find anything on like Bob Mueller face stop\nThere's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years and has been found anybody is still going and that's exactly what this is going to be\nIf somebody doesn't stand up and stop this\nSomebody on the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks Brett Kavanaugh\nSomebody needs to speak up for um somebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or you wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals but that's not happening\nWell but it is now late yesterday afternoon in the Senate floor here is the turtle\nOn top of the six ... investigation of judge Kavanaugh them across the land of the supplemental investigation\nThey listen carefully Mr prior to that you can practically hear the sound of the Democrats moving the goalposts\nWhat their goal I've moved on to found out\nWhat it all run to sign all the time for enlisted Atlanta truck for it's come to a close\nJudge Kavanaugh's nomination is out of committee were considering it here on the floor\nAnd Mr President will be voting\nThis way late yesterday afternoon Mitch McConnell on the floor of the Senate and he got so much support for what he did yesterday\nAmazing how that happens is he heard from so many people what a great thing he went out and he did it again he went out there again and he recycled they all Bill Clinton aligned to boot here's McConnell from just a couple of hours ago\nWhen judge Kavanaugh demonstrated is wildly acknowledge brilliance\nOpen minded enough to include you all of his confirmation hearing some shows or darker\nThe politics of personal destruction were willfully on\nAfter the FBI shares what they found\nCenters will have the opportunity to\nReally have the opportunity to vote no on the politics of personal destruction\nWill have the opportunity to vote yes\nOn this far dominated\nThat doesn't even touch what he did he went out there and he he didn't call these guys up by name but he quoted\nSome of the most outrageous why is that Democrats have been telling including members of the Judiciary Committee he pointed out their hypocrisy he pointed out their prevent like Kay soon as he pointed out their straight up and up lies it was so good to force chunk you assume or to go to the Florida we bought it\nAnd chunky went out there and tried to make chicken salad and when it was it was it was incredible listening to truck you I Believe ... she was eminently credible judge Kavanaugh is not in the other way around\nWe have a life time of investigation of Brett Kavanaugh folks\nThere have been six now seven FBI investigations background checks\nWe have had more people looking into every nook and cranny and Britain Kevin O's life and we haven't even began to look at hers\n\nWere just assuming she's credible because that's the Democrats position on this\nBut they do go back and they can look at the anything Kevin ... done but she is off limits for something we can go and find out what she did it although beach parties we can't go out and find out what she did when she was out there skiing\nAnd surfing and flying around and do we [laughter] none of that's been done and yet she is credible and he isn't\nAnd now die by Dr biased ran into die by she was going someplace up on Capitol Hill a reporter said\nSenator Feinstein would have formed vote friday on Kavanaugh will be too soon raw\nI Believe is I Believe is just to say not the case and ah [noise] it's one of her money going to\nOh by the way you look like I'm not saying this guy like there is a part of me to think\nThat he was in on this from the get go I there's a part of me thinks that he was not scared to death when he got harassed in protest that an elevator there's part of me thinks he because he hates Trump and that's what all this really is all it is is is aimed at people eating tromp on Kavanaugh's away\nIn order to get Trump they gotta get Kevin on\nThe lake is out there so you know what I um I I Am Kevin wants to part of the three I don't think we need other like wait a minute you said you're going to vote for him friday morning flights\nAnd then you did\nFlake voted for Capitol after claiming was going to vote for it now he's on the east to part isn't for me I I don't know I don't want that on the court I don't think we can do that\n\nFlake is demonstrating that his name is actually an active or an apt description of his personality\nNow here's Feinstein he wanted to wait a one of the week everybody agreed to all week as ...\nYou agree it's all week as predicted by me and many others within hours of agreeing to one week Democrats not long enough and here's die if I take this from the top again senator died five what a floor vote friday it'd be too so\nI I Believe that is I Believe it's just\nIt's Tuesday and um we have to put it all the facts together yeah we have and this is I guess it's by tens Supreme Court hearing that I sat on and there's never been one like that with the issues like this here and I don't take it lightly\nSo we need to do our due diligence that there are other issues too there's reproductive choice for women\nBut there's a presidential authority Weiner's an opinion that he wrote where he said in DC assault weapons case assault weapons they're not regulated because he would come and use something there are things like that they need to be looked at\nWait a minute wait a minute I thought the investigation was to look into what's your face balls the Ford maybe Ramirez and it'd be outside sweat Nick and they're all being looked into and there's nothing there\nAnd so friday all its way too soon besides we gotta look at a reproductive health because you know Brett Kavanaugh wants women to die\nAnd Brett Kavanaugh this and Brett Kavanaugh that that's why I say somebody has got to stand up and stop this shut it down because it isn't going to stop it is never going to be time to vote it's never going to be time to end the investigation is never going to be time\nTo move this thing forward that's taken
