I couldn't tell you where the house was today for my life depended on uh\nBut I can tell you the guy and his girlfriend and the layout of the\nKitchen and all I can do that but where it was I couldn't\nBut rape victims in sexual abuse victims um it depends on on on the victims some of them have vividly recall them every detail like this and some some uh some don't but her date range a and descriptions of the house in a place for the people there who all deny it\nUh and the timing of all if you put this whole package together it just [noise]\n[laughter] and the reason for it to keep a conservative off the Supreme Court I just don't think any of this is spontaneous happenstance\n[laughter] I don't think Feinstein just received a letter she didn't know it was coming just don't believe it can't prove it\nJust don't believe it I don't believe he's minding our own business one day in a letter from a constituency who said I don't want to be known I don't want to be named and I don't want this taken any further\nWell they're ... ... ... ... it doesn't make any sense on last you\nPut it in the proper context of what the express purpose of this is which I happen to believe is forcing Kavanaugh to resign to withdraw or for Trump to withdraw from I think it was beginning to unravel\nBecause Trump and Kevin all have hung in and buy unravel I mean be exposed for the phone is that much of it is any weight Suzie I'm Glad you called\nThank you thank you very much Miami, Florida next Robert your rank the happier\n[laughter] Russia was from a lifelong will soon have been listening to do for Thirty years [laughter]\nUm I just want to thank you for everything they do it for the country and especially your came in and I'm from a song that you do once here it's a fantastic and I mean so to me sir [laughter] my question is what's what do you think is going on with the mother pro because it ... if you\nDon't well now that's an interesting question what's going on with the mother probably here's the latest I heard of that Mahler probe they the story actually has a sentence and it really\nA special counsel's office and Robert Mueller to third us choir most in\nMost most honest man in Milwaukee is shedding prosecutors shedding privacy now when your cat or dog sheds it means losing hair a mother is losing prosecutors meaning their ...\nTheir ... the jobs almost not in their ... their ... their moving away and they're going off to other things\nThere's less and less for his team of Trump haters to what to do [noise] I just repeat what I said at the very opening of the program I don't think this tax story would have run today\nIf Mahler we're still hot on the trail and had something Andy if the Ford story weren't beginning to unravel the New York times story wouldn't ... when I saw\nOn drudge this massive New York times during my first reaction is remember folks I Am a student of the media and the left and nothing happens by accident the times didn't just finished this story by deadline last night\nThere by making it able to be published they'd been holding it\nThey've been working on it for a year and they've been coordinating with the Showtime network they've been producing a documentary for the past year documenting how the times found it how they reported it how they print it how they wrote it the fact that this thing was released and published last night for today\nFirst reaction I had was a cabinet thing must really be unraveling because it's time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle\nAnd it's not really new its taxes\nThe latest news correct me on this Mr ... if you've seen something more recent\nBut the last story I saw on this is [laughter] Mahler [laughter] [noise] I don't know what to believe in ... Mahler is showing various people Roger Stone emails texts and asking them what they know about it\nWe're down now to Roger Stone in an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump cheated with Russia\nMuller was the guy that was going to find it and when we got\nEverybody thinking Trump cheated with Russia and Muller was the guy that was going to find it and\nWhen we got Trump's tax returns we were going to see\nThat it's important\nThat enabled Trump to hold onto his money and get more But Trump's wealth is directly tied to illicit activity what Russia will there isn't any Russian anything in the New York times story\nSo [noise] um [noise]\nWe're getting down to the nitty gritty I'd ... you know ethics say that a special counsel should not right and release a report within this close proximity to an election\nBecause of the impact that it would have been they of course are a unbiased and the only jak given the Justice Department and they're not about affecting the outcome of elections which is all they've been trying to do it for two years [noise]\nI wouldn't be surprised if they released a report you know a couple of days before the election which ... Trump for irresponsibility excoriated for a bad attitude excoriated for having a really really shady friends and all that but does it accused him of anything\nIf it's not supposed to happen before the election that's when it probably will happen is the way these people operate but but maybe it won't\n[noise] outside of that\nI'm like everybody else I don't know what Mueller has I don't know what he's going to be a lot of what he's going to report 'em ... zero not at all I Know is that the drive by media decided to try to make something else a bigger story today than the Kavanaugh story\nRush Limbaugh going the way on the net for Washington Mall W.
