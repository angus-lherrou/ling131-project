N. A. L. Washington comes to talk [noise]\nThere's been a lot of talk and I would have been even for me one of the Republicans going to do if Kavanaugh is not good at first [noise] going to sit home and going to be fired up what am I going to do that's not\nThe question the question is what are the Democrats are going to do if Kavanaugh is confirmed that's what I think maybe the bigger question and in the interests of discovering this was going to the audio soundbites\nWe have a group of protesters occupying senator Collins Susan Collins of Maine office and during the protests one of the protesting women made\nThanks senator Collins Susan Collins of Maine office and during the protests one of the protesting women made some remarks\nI always\nRemind than me I can share\nThe black sea Ford was not going to be challenged on anything she said she was going to be encouraged to pay the say different things tell different stories as I say or whatever purpose\nI see that does make sense to let her just caved just give her more rope understand that\nThat was my ... year give it more role but if you don't do anything with the rope and what what what good is that the I don't know how they intended to use it I I still think this like a lot of people agree with you that this woman has gotten away and not been thoroughly investigated she got away with an anonymous letter\nThat she didn't want made public suppose it does anybody really believe that either because this woman the ad irritated that she's been made to go public\nWith this she doesn't act irritated about that to me that she wants to be helpful while she's terrified I I I just I I I think in this climate and tell you the truth out their pets\nTo try to poke holes in her story and just six the if the Republicans had succeeded in exposing her as a liar I think the Democrats were the last\n\nI yeah I think they would have gone batty\nAds the Republicans not at her I think they wouldn't have cues the Republicans have brow beating her and making her say different things because they're all on record as having said they believed her before they even matter before they even talk to her they said they believed or in fact I don't even know why the Democrats need to see the FBI report\nBecause they said they believe her from the get go\n\nThey're not even open to the possibility that she's telling a story that cannot be corroborate ... haven't been\nThis is Lewis in Los Angeles is we uh stay with the phones Hi Louis great to have you here hello\nHey how're you doing Russ is my first year list and then I started listening to you Sean Hannity everybody and I thank you for for for basically Yellen what I Want to go out so loud all the time you know you guys say it and I'm thinking in and my first year uh I've never really been into politics I've never really aired\nAn offensive you know just kind of like ... they're going to vote whatever but this was really bad this was\nSomething that that changed the family that a lot of sun we got we got a big family and and it was like how can you just try and destroy someone where no kind of cooperation no kind of\nProof no kind of and then Trump said yesterday and I feel like they're basically yelled out what I said it was like everything she was saying but I don't know what I don't know I don't know I don't know so it was like well well what happened what went on their own movement going on you're you're you're you're saying these allegations but you don't know certain\nThings that are very important like who took your home they should have been traumatized euphoria it's something like that happen you would have been like a mom picked near a big call somebody get in on\nSomething so it just after that the other destroyed that man and tried to ... century and basically it was just like I got to vote I got to vote for rights I got to vote for ... for or just the our values in this country which are being\nReally this ... this has awakened us that much\nYeah yeah that that you know not that not that women can be believed but both men and women can live to say that this older certain nobody can can\nRely on women can't no no you said earlier wait ... years you nailed what this is about earlier you correctly identified that the United States Senate was attempting to destroy this guy you didn't know who he was some pilot call but you saw a guy\nTrying to be destroyed his wife his career his future destroyed and nobody had any corroborating evidence for all of this was going to destroy and that's what got you in gear\nAnd and I well I think like the gentleman before I went on to other people to talk my wife we watched it together it was like wait a minute like you're not add up I'm Sorry when you look for and there for like two plus you know something out if it wasn't you know what I mean it just didn't add up\nHere we have Lewis thank you thank for the call we've got other anecdotal story buddy dovetails with what we're seeing in the polling data we're seeing the generic ballot advantages Democrats have now gone in the latest Maris NPR poll had a twelve point advantages now two points which is\nBattling advantage the Democrats have now gone and the latest Maris NPR poll had a twelve point advantage is not two points which is statistically tied that's the margin of error or in in all these other generic ballot Paul's which I think er [noise]\nI don't think the Republicans have ever landed in one of the news and the Republicans women Congress\nAll the time so so it's Nineteen Ninety four anyway you people realize when the Republicans want to Ninety four was the first time in forty years\nThat they ran or control the house since then\nThey've lost control and won control back but I ... I don't think there's ever been a generic ballot poll ever that shows the Republicans had\nI could be wrong I doubt it I don't recall ever having seen one\nBut now we're seeing voter enthusiasm shift\nTo the Republicans and Democrats are are losing some and believe me if this all his real at this polling game as accurate as the same stuff as Democrats are saying it's affecting them then there's this from the Atlantic now the Atlantic is a left wing publication as is most of us medium\nThe headline of this story conservative women are angry about Kavanaugh and they think other voters are to\nHere's a quote in the two weeks since it claims against capital of first emerged many feminist groups\nHave called on senators and the American public to believe women who come forward with allegations Kamala Harris the progressive Democrats enter from California captured the sediments\nWhen she questioned for during the hearing I Believe you and I believe many Americans across the country believe you\nBut the writer of this story whose name is am agreeing said the women I interviewed however raises them ten the notion that people's accusations should be believed on the basis of their identity alone\nThis makes me furious because I think that's taking advantage for the worst purposes of something that's real in our culture a woman said women are not a monolithic blocked most of us are not gonna take to the streets with pitchforks and torches\nThat said there's a large large percentage of us who feel very very strongly about the way this process has played out conservative women are angry about Kavanaugh they think other voters are too\nConservative women living suburbs [noise]\nThe reason I ask that is because the Democrats claimed to have a hold on college educated suburban women\nWell they may be losing that hold too if some of this polling data is correct let me just say this if everything were just and it isn't and I know it\nBut if everything were saying the Democrats would be destroying themselves right now as they did back in two thousand two when they did the Wellstone Mario the Democrat Party\nIs in a same world the Democrat Party is engaging in self immolation right now\nWith the treatment of Kavanaugh\nThe backing of a woman who's got no evidence hasn't had a you have a corroborated and thanks that Donald Trump now more Americans than ever know the truth of her story\nAnd the truth of her story is that it's full of holes\nIf Trump had went on his rant going on his ran on Monday Night the dry buys would've never reported that because they had not reported\n\nThe Democrats are not the majority they did not win the Senate that when the house the advice and consent role does not give them the right to determine who goes on the court and who doesn't that's for the winters\nBut the the behavior to Democrats engaged in here the public political murder\nOf a highly achieved brilliant guy who never did anything to anybody anywhere near the way he's been described\n\nPeople bringing forth the F allegations like this wouldn't be as flies in and then no evidence to back it up\nIn a same world would be paying a price so ... so high they wouldn't even engage in this kind of behavior but the Democrats think they speak for a majority of Americans because they have the media on their side and they think\n\nThey have succeeded in making the majority of Americans hate break Kavanaugh and hates conservatives and Republicans as a as well what we don't live in a saying world and we don't live at the same country right now\nConservatives that Republicans as a as well [noise]\nWell we don't live in a saying world you know we don't live at the same country right now but uh it's still possible for the Democrats to pay a huge huge price for this and given the standard time test of American moral code\nAnd are sent and set of values the Democrats\nMaking a snowman with my kids\nSnow sits on my roof\nJust get a big old Brown's bottle

better\nAt Christianity was originally confined to very small circle of people in Jerusalem\nAnd it went from a small little movement to a what what was the most popular religion and it is\nFascinating story how that happened which she attempts to explain in the book it's called Jesus Says residents\nAnd it's about the birther Christianity using the book of acts it's all in the book of acts fault I mean when I say it's all there it is\nI mean it's not a substitute for reading the Bible but it's the book of acts if all there\nSo he uses the book of acts and six New Testament a pistols as the introductory guide here to get people\nWho want to read the Bible butter intimidated\nBy up\nTo actually get started doing it so it's sort of a primer that when you finish this book and start the Bible you'll have a head start and you'll be more likely to stay with it\nIt\nDetails the suffering and the sorrow of the joys and the triumph\nOf the apostles and all of the key figures\nIn Christianity following the deaf and resurrection and the sensor that Jesus Christ which if the resurrection doesn't happen in Christianity\nDoes it exist they and and\nThat's one of the toughest things to make people believe how in the world that you can't physically\nPut your arms around that resurrection from the dead\nBut it's a key element of Christianity it's one of the big stumbling blocks that that people have I Can't even imagine that I mean I heard I don't want to mention any names liberal talk show host really were raising a Christian\nYou really believe that camp you that's why you people are not you can't really think there's somebody died hey back why that's why that's why people like you're crazy\nWell\nFor Christianity to be what it is that had to happen\nAnd my brother David is\nA devoted to helping people believe that it's happening by accepting what's in the Bible but before you can accept what's in the Bible you have to open it\nAnd so this is it looked it it's it's not simply a primer it to its own story of has its own telling of the tail but it's designed\nTo be sort of like an introduction\nTo the Bible into Christianity\nBoth test them it's but this focus on the book of acts because that's where it all his men don't just read the book X. forget everything else but it's all there in the book at so that's why they chose the book of acts to start this [noise] so and I I again I I thank you for giving me the time to mentioned as it would not\nBe a timely at any time in the next two or three days because of all the other news happening out
