blown up losing the war and she made a serious miscalculation exactly [noise]\nExactly what I told you yesterday\nThese people think they live in their own little tunnel vision of world and they have no idea\nThat they are on the table anymore to dominate and create a news narrative any way I Want to get to that in due course because not what I was going to lead with today but I got a news buster story here\nDisaster for Elizabeth Warren is all three networks mock Native American claim this is the last thing that she expected it happened the news media cannot carry her water\nHer excuses to flimsy what's really interesting about this is the news media has known all along that this is a bogus claiming they were more than willing to carry it they were more than willing to put up up up promoted propagated\nDo whatever they could they knew full well that this thing is bogus and it was nothing more than an attempt in political trick\nAnd they gave it their best shot but she used to

is doing great damage to the country east damaging the media\n\nCan I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's\n\nCan I read the transcript of the interview this is CNN's transcript of the AP interview and their headline Trump\nTells a piece he won't accept blame a GOP loses house ready [noise] three to one\nA reporter okay so my question is if Republicans want to lose control of the house in November sixth or a couple of days later depending on how long it takes count the votes do you believe that you'll bear some responsibility for that no\nI think I'm helping people\nLook I'm forty eight and one in the primaries actually it's much higher than that because I endorsed a lot of people that were successful\nThat people don't even talk about but many of those forty eight as you know where people that have no chance in some cases we look at Florida you look at Donovan in Staten Island he was losing by ten points I endorsed him he won I can give you a long list of names look at Georgia governor\nMany many racist and I will say that we have a very big impact I don't believe anybody's ever had this kind of impact a lot of having they would say that in the old days if you got the support of a president or if you've got the support or somebody it would be nice to have but it meant nothing zero like literally zero\nWell some of the people live indoors to have gone up forty and fifty points just on the endorsement in nowhere in that state but does Donald Trump say\nHe doesn't even addressed the house last he doesn't even accept the premise a pie\nOffers it as a premise so they say if Republicans lose control the house with a ... do you believe you better responses but no\nI think I'm helping people that becomes a headline Trump tells a pie he won't accept blend of GOP loses house now the eight people will tell you well that's essentially what he was saying no it isn't essentially you are miss quoting\nDonald Trump is not looking at himself as a negative at all he's not looking forward and seeing the need for a skill says a P he thinks he's helping people he thinks he is helping secure victory but it's not even in his mind that they're going to lose and somebody's gonna blame him\nThis is why Trump never\nMisses an opportunity to talk to the media it's why he tweets over and over and over again so now we got a little Bryan's daughter at

back just to make it fair NBC News\nUncertainty over a blue wave NBC News fine Democrat and GOP voter registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell out there during all do a whole big voter registration drive out there\nThe Democrats have been registering voters in prison they've been registering voters at the DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it possible\nThat democratic voter registration levels at the same as pest cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy there is so much excitement there so much motivation there's so much inspiration to not thinking hold them back and yet and yet\nThe generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought\nNow NBC is is is very very worried\nThey're worried that something that's not\nA blue wave may be shaping up here\nThat's what this headline news ... certainly they over a blue wave NBC News finds Democrat GOP voter registration at the same level as past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty fourteen to twenty sixteen with activity from twenty sixty inch current\nHelps put these numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twelve sixteen include\nA complete picture of registration from those years\nWhereas plenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time well what that's all you need I mean if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered and time to vote so it's that seems like a little\nHope will we don't have a full database or numbers for two thousand ha well you've got enough to know\n[noise] so how can this be how can voter registration we've Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration because there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake\nThen they\n'em from the Washington Post\nThere's so many people that want to fix that mistake then they call 'em from the Washington Post\nBy Megan McCarthy dull trying to help the Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans headline will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\n\nThink the odds of that are pretty good or not well let's play the game what's hypothetically say that that pressure is brought to bear it's not up the Mahler it's going to be up to Rosenstein and the president to an extent Congress that's who gets the report what yes\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein of whoever\nAnd somebody like Trump says well okay hard if you want to see him and they release it and there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks in one of the week they're sixteen never Trump anti Trump pay longer is on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah one of the week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue wave\nIf Mueller doesn't have any of that than there is no way they want this release before them in terms that's why\nThey're linking ... or has it ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think the report says every member they have two years no more than that and a two and a half years of daddy reporting that Trump and Russia colluded so\nIn their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe the Trump\nRussia collusion happens so Mueller's report is Randy is to be released Susan create the impression that it's only a matter of time now before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nThe voting in turn out prior to the mid term

we have that there is no evidence for just like how many of them believe ball Z forward\nTheir politics requires that they believe that it's mandates they believe that\nIf they are told before them in terms that the smaller report doesn't\nHave this evidence and will not lead to President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whenever it is released is going to really be targeted at Trump\nAs an incompetent as a boob who are in danger to the United states electoral system with his hires and with some of the people on the staff like Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as any incompetent\nWho nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his incompetence stupidity but I

reminded to go out and vote\nUnfortunately I think some do because um October surprises maybe Trump will do some\nI did go out and vote unfortunately I think some do because um October surprises maybe Trump will do some sort of sweet as you mentioned aerial that might be\nLacking you know tone or judgment and some people the Kenyan that might change some last minute ... but you know the vast majority obviously are going to vote Republican\nBut you know just hit it out there just to keep reminding them of what the alternative is it somehow they decide they are on the fence all of a sudden\nSo important so crucial in making this\nWest complex less of a problem and it makes it much harder to get I mean cutting wires is easy but disrupting why fi connections takes a little bit more work\nThey use ... and they use computer chips in their centers in an detectors in the age the cameras that come with every system that sends signals would doors and windows are open\nAnd if you wander simply say system as you've left the home you get a notification when there is activity I e somebody tried to break in or there is a fire or something simply safe pays attention to every detail of their home security system so that when you do the installation it's\nSimple and actually fun to do and when you finish\nYou will have an intimate knowledge and awareness of your system it comes pre tested move freaking thing you're\nAll you have to do is installing or get something they're happy as no big deal you can do it a less than an hour but don't let that make you believe it's not serious it's deadly serious it is serious serious it is just as effective in justice comprehensive as any other security system you wouldn't get that uses wires\nYou have access to their twenty four seven monitoring systems service that's only fourteen Ninety nine a month so goes the end it simply safe usa dot com saved ten percent on the system you chose and get a two month is sixteen day money back guarantee if you don't like it you'll get all your money back and you got two months to try it [noise]\nNobody sense of backed by the way Mary rabbit smidgen simply safe usa dot\nCom here's Larry in Huntsville, Alabama great to have you sir Hi\nThank you so much Raj I'm just so no life man than here in Huntsville, Alabama who don't shut up\nThat you won't she well yeah and so you're you're demonstrating your your arrogant white privilege here\nThe yes I Am a [laughter] uh uh I I was living there you go to the uh the article from I Believe it was ... that a law that they're going to release the mall or a report or sometimes after the election we're ready to that yeah understand\nThat we don't believe that we're not going to believe anything Mueller anyway [noise]\nSo that's an interesting point too I mean\nUnless the unless he input cake or the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton and the DNC\nA in a a good for the gay shouldn't including with Russia which they evidently did then you know we're not going to believe anything that report says the [noise]\nUh I I just don't understand that the drop by media just doesn't get it they're not going to feel of people that voted for Donald Trump away from Donald Trump\nSaid I Want to understand it's like a you know the magnificent seven uh both guys didn't you know when it came up there and they didn't check into who they ... what kind of Christians were or a a you know if they\nAre not with the er good why they wanted somebody did offend them and fight against all the things that we see a witch and destroy the country of the last uh eight to a a sixty years\nWell I don't think that the media is right now focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is\nUm I think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to and if they could be it would be icing on the ... I think their primary objective now is the flood the zone with anti Trump voters\nDemocrats made up of every disparate coalition a group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democrat Party is a combination of coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nCombination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters\nSomebody of the focus I think is\nOn jamming up a first time participation\nUm and that's why this this is Suzie as little\nThing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger is so that's why I think that they have strategically become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans debate Trump\nI I think they they move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake\nNo I think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in\nPerusing the news as I Do more and more stories that are starting to raise red flags about the blue wave\n\nAnd there are some big brush them falling for doing this on purpose or sucking you we are making you think they're giving up they're making you think their credit despair either trying to make you think you got it in a bag\nNo they're not going to ever pull that off not here not with me but I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have media wide throughout the entire left wing media universe\nA disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's legit I've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and I if if I end up being wrong so be it I'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried\nAbout it but it is I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHaven't been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in a way on the outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they had been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the Kavanaugh thing they haven't won anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on even they're stupid travel uh order the layers using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda there's some things he hasn't been able to do it like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think if all of the things were true I've known people hate Trump regret their votes a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is president the Trump wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if the Democrats are right about\nAll this but they're not write about it so I I'm I'm\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there's a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are faucet and fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nThen you couple that with their their mentality but says winning is their birthright power is their birthright their entitlement but\nElections haven't been going their way I mean how in the world stopped to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary would've won in the first trumpet it never won in the first place if all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\n\nThey thought they had it in the bag and two thousand sixteen and they were ... didn't energized too there was one of the talk of Democrats not turning out back then anyway I'm a little long segments going to be short\nAll of us well read about it in the paper tomorrow rush on the ... be network a\nWhen you put a safe in your
