Indiana Montana Tennessee Texas also North Carolina\nOnly in Nevada\nHave Democrat affiliated voters exceeded Republican affiliated voters so far in the early voting the latest data disturbed NBC suggest robust in a fool's Yaz them among my eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave\nRepublicans typically dominated early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have an advantage when in person early voting so for example the entire early voting patriot in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is a complete\nNow that that is somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats in the states it is that early voting\nAlmost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is the Democrats are drawn up in the early Italy and\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a bad on election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and again this is NBC News\nSo the question here and it and the hard to apply this to actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to conventional wisdom conventional wisdom is and conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nThat Democrat enthusiasm is off the charts\nThat the Democrats have been so motivated ever since they got screwed in two thousand sixty ever since Trump and the Russians stole that election from the Democrats have been motivated like you can't bully to get out

the kind of thing that's happening but nobody in conventional\nWashington elitist establishment Washington what do you ever think what happened these people come up with their story that stuck with it if it's even if it means they're lying to themselves about it like for example if they if they get it in their heads everybody hates Trump\nAnd that hatred for Trump has brought in and magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this massive\nTurnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energized when they get that in their heads and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens and they don't know what to do about it\nAnd they get\nNon plus and a little concerned about which is where\nThey are now\nAnd I've shared with you yesterday there's a there's a ... a lot of stories

five eighty six percent chance the Republicans lose the house eighty six percent chance of Democrats one how does all this fit\nTogether well it doesn't obviously\nIf Republican early voting is out distancing Democrat early voting and Democrats have always owned that\n\nMust mean that something is drastically wrong here something is terribly wrong in the formula\nFor this kind of Republican
