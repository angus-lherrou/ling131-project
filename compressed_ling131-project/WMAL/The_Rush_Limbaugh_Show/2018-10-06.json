E. L. dot com\nSo winter government executive report there was a bit of a bumpy months for the T S P last month with a couple of funds losing value only slight gains in the rest of those funds and does that change any of the plan and you do for your clients\nI don't know ... you know several years ago and I was actually many years ago more than I'd like to admit a couple of decades ago [laughter]\nSo you're on the dinner table with mom and dad and dad said winter if you ever wonder about what to do with your money if you've ever wondering about what the market's going to do if you've ever worried about making the right financial decision then here's what you need to do\n[noise] you just put your money and CDs because you'll always be able to get at least five percent\nAnd he always be able to get five percent and and obviously that's not true right we now know the last ... years the banks can pay far less than five percent and bank accounts and CDs but man the market's going up so much\nThat it doesn't really matter we just know that if you're invested um you can get a good return and I think the tide is kind of change and around a little bit interest rates are starting to pick up a little not quite five percent but they're going up the Federal Reserve announced that they're going to raise rates again in December and at the same time the market\nFeels like it's getting closer and closer to the peak and there has been some volatility at the beginning of this year and\nAnd the last few weeks so the real question is what the impact going to be on your retirement what the impact going to be any retirement planning especially if you're a federal employee you have the CSP even contributing to it for years and years it's been giving you a ... double digit growth for the last eight nine years\nHow do you make sure that you don't lose\nTo make sure that you don't lose a big portion of that before you retire a matter of fact the main reason why I hate losing from an account that have been saving into over years and years and years is because I hate going back in time I can you imagine can you imagine Jennifer going through a day without your phone\nThat people\nAren't able to necessarily make the choices that they want just by buying the long term care policy that's silly talk this not real life it's so much simpler than that it's just about understanding how to set up your financial situation\nAt the front end of retirement so that you can take on whatever's going to come your way and the twenty to Thirty years to come\nAnd I said you know mom and dad you know dad had Parkinson's for a long time they weren't eligible for a long term care\nBut they recognized that had the awareness to set up money for the second phase of retirement to make sure they had an a financial flexibility to both maintain their quality of life and deal with the unexpected and so what I've learned if I've learned anything\nAbout long term care and preparing for deteriorating health it's that retirement income plan\nIs so important it just means so much in real life it's not the same as just invest the money and letting it grow in making withdrawals miniature retirement income plan doesn't just give you peace of mind it helps you deal with all facets of life during retirement\nAnd you can start to build that retirement income plan that's based on your situation what your needs what your family's needs are it's also based on what the assets you have what you said in your key SPA and your other retirement accounts and and what your family has you can get started in that process by calling three oh one\nEight five zero zero six eight three again that number is three oh one eight five zero zero six eight three so even if you've done a good job saving up for retirement there's still a pretty good chance\nYou've forgotten something and we're going to talk about those factors that are easily overlook what about federal benefit [noise]\nLooking for ideas on how to spend all their free time you're going to have when you retire why not follow the lead of some of our president for example you can play a lot of golf like Gerald Ford you could grab a hammer and build things like Jimmy Carter you could even bring out your inner daredevil and take up skydiving like George W.

M. A. L. more Washington comes to talk\nTo that federal benefits with winter ... generally jak here alongside winter and as we continue our discussion\nToday if you have any questions you can only sending in through the website it's winter ... dot com that's T R O X E L winter what retirement factors do most of your clients overlook when they come to you or early in the planning process\nYou know I think a lot of a lot of people that I run into that I mean they don't think of their retirement like the death machine that tests the machine they just don't know you cannot\nAnd so let me tell you a little bit about the death machine please get an idea of what I'm Talking about so we're all familiar with like a tricycle mhm right sure at the front wheel to back wheels All right so now in vision a scooter and tries to go in a blender and in and out comes\nFrom the combination the death machine now now so it is a stand up tries to gold that writes like a scooter\nAnd the way that you move this thing so you have your back wheels and then you have a front wheel so you have a scooter handle okay you put a foot and a foot on top of each of the back wheels and you actually shut me back and forth to get us to go [laughter]\nGame and it's fun it is so much fun and you can do doughnuts and all different kinds of things in your driveway at least according to came to have seen it happen if they're going to have it in the camera is awesome and the death machine so\n... when I go to a movie a couple of years back and he there was something you want to say I don't even remember the movie and we're kind of doing it at a\nDad son night out and and doing our thing well meanwhile Kammen is showing introducing Corey mom\nTo the death [laughter] oh no she actually tries to write it I've always been smart enough to just observe [laughter] right [laughter] searched riding the death\nMachine and she gets a little comfortable but one thing that most of you know in this area even when things even when it looks like the ground is flat\nIt's not right if you're into cycling river in a bike around\nOr you've ever done some jogging around your neighborhood you realized very quickly that everything looks flat because you're in a car [laughter] right and you have an engine to propel you propelling yourself\nYou notice the hills well so she knows the hell and she's going she's getting up the hill and she's shimmering back and forth she gets the top and she was so proud of herself a matter of fact she celebrated\nShe turned to Kansas [laughter] yes I did it\nBut you know it's on the other side of the hill oh does she have to go back down you have to go back down yeah she goes down and she spent so much energy figuring out how to ... up the hill\nThat she never thought to ask about how the brakes work oh winter oh no so she goes down this thing and all I can tell you as I got about seven text messages that the movies now you know how it is the mood is you're not supposed to have your phone out like the seventh one you like okay you know I'm obligated to look yeah\nAnd it just says blood mom\nEmergency around [laughter] oh that would I picked up I mean I'm sure that there was more said and the seven messages that's just what stuck so what happened she gets going\nDownhill and she doesn't know what to do yeah going downhill and she doesn't know what to do so\nShe got nervous I've ever done I've ever like frozen oh yeah ... and she crashed hard [laughter] she broke her arm we thought she broke her collar bone but I guess you can strain it without breaking it hurts just as bad bad guy she'll get as much attention in the ER\nAnd right because of that this death machine so she has never been on the death machine says that [laughter] ... right and it was a\nStory because we were all just kind of shaking her head like mom come on you know you can't read the death machine downhill\nAnd and she knows that too now and it's a I think about retirement the number one mistake that people make is that they learn how to go up the hill right they learn how it's not easy it's not easy to save enough it's not easy always know how to invest your money\nBut most figure out how to accumulate something meaningful there's substantial by retirement they get up that hill in some of you and I know who you are\nRight you can admit it's okay it's just us I Know who you are some of your pretty proud of being on a hill man look at me and the market sense so good last few years I have more than I ever thought I'd have I have a good amount I'm all set for retirement\nMan that's a mistake isn't it because of what's coming next you got to go down the hill you have to figure out\nBut I'm ... I'm all set for retirement man that's a mistake isn't it\nBecause of what's coming next you got to go down the hill you have to figure out how to take everything that you've saved how to take your pension that you've earned and the Social Security credits that you've earned everything they've saved for Thirty years to get on top of the so you have to figure out how to go down without crashing\nAnd the other assets that you have and start to connect the dots\nBetween your vision and your assets right and then the vision becomes more tangible and Jennifer I think that's where we start considering housing choices right wouldn't you want to know if you're going to buy a new house and retirement will\nWhat should the price point B mhm oh sure right um\nWhat is my retirement gonna look like white with we could arbitrarily pick a price point oh I like the million dollar houses [laughter]\nSo we all like the million dollar houses but what's going to be appropriate for your assets in your retirement and and your priorities and so with a retirement income plan we start connecting the retirement vision to the retirement assets and start\nDefining what are the choices to be made\nYou know it's interesting there was a couple that that came in a few weeks ago and and they were had both been divorced um they've found each other and and we're we're kind of setting up a new life for themselves but their in their mid fifties and\nThey not only had the challenge of integrating their household situations together and their finances together but then also in their new life they had some ambitions in terms of quality of life and things that they wanted to do and traveled that they wanted to do\nBetween now and retirement and then they wanted to move and retire successfully and so a lot of moving pieces\nAnd what they wanted was different than what it may seem right they didn't want to know the best mutual fund to own the best insurance product to own they weren't interested in what the stock market was going to do next week and said they had real definitive tangible needs\nThey wanted to know the most efficient way to set up their finances\nThey wanted to know well now that they're going to buy a house together for the near term what's a reasonable amount they should spent how much do they put down for a down payment what was going to be best for them especially considering the context of retiring in the next five to ten years\nAnd it was interesting because when I was asking him questions I think they were kind of mad at me\nSo mad like hostile mad but like man this guy's wasting our time he keeps asking us a lot of questions why won't he just tell us what to do\nAnd we got into the strategy\nAnd I noticed within just a couple of minutes they were leaning in like they were all in there hanging on every single word because they knew\nThat the strategy conversation\nWas where they were going to make things happen right they knew when we talked about why their down payment should only be fifty thousand dollars\nAnd how they should say under a jumbo loan and how if they were able to find a home that four hundred and fifty thousand five hundred thousand range standard jumbo loan keep their payments at a certain amount keep their down payment a certain amount that they could have flexibility in the near term\nThey would have enough money to save for retirement and we started connecting\nHousing decisions directly into their retirement vision\nRight and it became very real because they in in in one of the spouses that you know what I'm so excited and I'm like okay [laughter]\nAnd they're like we're so excited because we didn't tell you this but I had already met with a couple of advise as a matter of fact we've had kind of a debate we've been kind of argument about whether that we use my advisor\nOr we do a new and we've heard you on the radio and we kind of decided that we you were speaking to us over the radio and so we decided to me with you and I've been a little bit hesitant\nBut for all the times that I've spoken with my advisor they've never shown me the path to using my money they always are talking about my portfolio or the investments or why they made this trade or that trade or a rate of return but anytime I've asked them about how to make her time at work\nHow to negotiate through changing my housing or getting married or divorced they didn't know what to do they just kept defaulting back to my investment account\nAnd so I always knew that I needed some different and when I listen to your radio show I feel like that's what you're talking to me\nBut now I can feel the tangible benefit because you're really showing me that retirement income play like even though we're not retired you're showing us how to use the money that we've saved to accomplish what we want and when it comes to housing that's what we're talking about we're talking about\nReally appreciating where you want to live and what you want your life to look like and connecting it most effectively with the assets that you have\nSurely there are no one size fits all answer when it comes to that retirement plan winter and his team that bridge mark wealth management can help you build that customize plan it's going to factor in your federal benefits as well as your other assets in al help show you\nMark wealth management can help you build that customize plan it's going to factor in your federal benefits as well as your other assets\nAnd they'll help show you how to put all those pieces together into your own retirement income plan\nThey'll show you how to make the most of those benefits and they'll help you work toward your goals and retirement but you need to call now to set up a time to get started on that retirement income plan you can do that by calling three oh one eight five zero zero six eight three\nAgain that number is three oh one\nEight five zero zero six to eight three winters we talk about lifestyle in retirement we're all familiar with the process of test driving a car before you buy it we all do that we know to do that\nDo you ever tell your clients to test drive their retirement lifestyle before they just jump into it\nNot really [laughter] I don't know why I don't think of retirement those terms of retirement being much more like a marathon oh I was a cross country runner so maybe I have a little bit of bias here now many many many years ago you're not going to find me running through a forest these shows but\nI was a long distance runner so I was a very good it's a hundred yard dash but if it was a ten mile race I was going to be pretty hard to be and so I think you trained for that a little bit differently than sprint or even a test drive\nInto retirement is all about having a plan that's built for years and years and even decades and so we don't need a test drive it because we can recognize in here and now what's gonna happen can't we mhm sure\nRight we know that the market's going to have years of going up and years of going down we know that inflation is going to happen\nWe know that you're going to live potentially a long time or a short time you're living perfect healthier helps going to deteriorate but we know all of\nThe possibilities the trick is setting up your assets\nTo deal with all of the unknowns moving forward that's the whole idea of having a distribution plan a retirement income plan the ideas that we couldn't test drive it even if our life depended on it right and I told the story\nBefore I'm a I'm going to tell her right now as of this trip that we made to the Steamboat Springs Colorado Steamboat Springs Colorado we flew into Denver and we rented a car to Steamboat Springs I have no idea I couldn't find it on a map is so long ago [laughter]\nBecause I couldn't see anything I mean have you ever been in a snow where you it's kind of like a fog but no fog it's just no and flurries and everything but\nMy dad was a determined guy [laughter] hard working guy and determined and we were going to get to Steamboat Springs so we're driving through the mountains and I don't know if there were a guard rails on the road I don't know\nI didn't feel like there were and so mom was crawling underneath the dashboard and she was talking like we couldn't quite hear what you're saying is muffled because she was in the fetal position\nAnd at every curve she thought we're going over the side of the mountain\nNo it was too young to know the difference I thought it was pretty exciting [laughter] yeah but she knew that she didn't want to go over and she didn't know what was going to be around the next Ben ... snow drift where he is a ... car stuck\nYou know she just didn't know what was going to happen\nAnd and a lot of ways that retirement we don't know what's coming next\nA lot of times mistakes can be made if we just presume what's coming around the corner of well the markets always going to make seven percent well you know what's worked for the last Twenty years is guaranteed to work for me the next Twenty years oh I have enough for retirement so I don't need to worry about it\nRight requirement industry says don't apply to me taxes always be the way that they are now and when we do that we wake up one day and were crawling under the dashboard and our car afraid of what's to come because if we plan for retirement\nBased on how the world looks today we're never going to get it wrong\nThat's right you don't want to be worrying about your retirement income plan while you're trying to enjoy this new stage of life ... winter and his team help you with that retirement income plan it's all part of the federal benefits review you can get started this weekend by calling three oh one\nEight five zero zero six eight three again that number is a three oh one eight five zero zero six eight three or you can\nStart on line at winter truck so dot com and we all know the drill when we go to the doctor for a checkup then you know back when it comes to check on your financial\nWinter getting blamed in when I\nWe all like to have options but sometimes there are too many options and it's difficult to make a decision or TSE for example when you retire you can leave and injure a count to ... you can take it all in a lump sum spread it out over a certain number of monthly payments or you\nEven turn it into an annuity to provide me with lifetime income which option is best for you there's no easy\nSpread it out over a certain number of monthly payments or you can even turn it into

Lori Drew radios yeah I'm ... author back with mortgage experts on Medicare ... Facebook followers on Twitter and Instagram for the most up to date financial news and homeowners tips well we've got to talk about the\nFed hike or the mortgage reports dot com posting story Federal Reserve hikes rates predicts a hike in twenty eight teen so nutshell it for me why should I care if I'm a homeowner\nWell here's the thing like the fed definitely raise rates are talking about raising them again here before the year ends\nMay keep in mind we're in October so there's only a couple of chances left where they could movies but I Know one thing I told you before the show and I've been saying over the last couple of weeks\nUm that here soon you're going to hear the average savings go up so I Know a lot of people like Sean what do you think about raids you know are you worried that they're going to go up I actually don't I Love it it's going to get people to make decisions are average savings will increase because credit card interest rates are going to go up so high the adjustable rate mortgages are going to become less attractive or a tractable\nI also think holding the lines of credit or going to become headaches a lot of people so what's going to happen is more families are going to choose to do the cash out refinance\nThe average savings will increase because the real things affected by this said rate hike is more the arms he logs and adjustable rate and the credit card debts\nAnd those are the things that you guys need to really pay a lot of attention to I Know that they bumped him up a quarter of a percent but I saw a sad that said the average\nCredit card rate was Seventeen point three one percent the average car rate is four point eight percent I challenged that when I see these raids all the time were definitely deal at much higher rates than that and on credit cards like you\nPeople that have these lending club loans those are twenty thirty some percent so I Believe in this market that the cash out refinance is going to be king you want to work with someone they can get you access to the cash quick\nEasy that's not going to nickel and dime ya I Believe in the network Capitol people at the phone number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight because you get great access to a low interest rate like four percent right now and a ten year fix\nThe a PR for point to wait you're not going to get hit with a bunch of fees so regardless of your situation what state you're calling from or any issues in the past\nYou know you know that you what do you pick up the phones and dial eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said\nYou're not going to get hit hard on origin nation processing fees are ah let's see underwriting admin Ray LaHood fees I Love the fact that this company chooses to lock the rates up front the average mortgage radio listeners saving five hundred and twenty dollars a month\nAnd what's great about it it can be done in his little is ten business day so I'm Down with this I'm not going to let you guys take higher interest rates in the future you know hopefully all the signs are points or exactly what we've been telling you\nWe used to advertise two and a half percent on the interest rate or Senate the four percent level right now and I'm not worried one bit because you've actress still going to rack up dead you guys are still gonna need to buy homes you're still going to want to try to pay off some things you're going to want to do a home improvements to make your whole more valuable there's all kinds of ways the sills save some money\nSo my question is are you over paint on your situation do you know for a hundred percent sure not call this number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nLet's say a little bit more about credit card debt I Know their credit repair services their debt settlement plans but you are not a fan of those institutions as a way of getting rid of credit card debt\nAbsolutely not I like the you know those services as much as I like the Cleveland Browns so\nYou know I'll tell you guys only if you remember if you want to do something negative to get something positive go down the debt settlement path enjoy wrecking your credit and just not having these creditors pain and getting your phone line blown up by every single person trying to get a handout so in my opinion if you want to save money to\nDo something positive to get something positive I'm only going to push you guys on the path that is going to save the money to keep your credit you know where it's out or improved\nI don't believe in damaging something to improve something I'm not about that I think that's really kind of you know you know do value in the service in the future so I Believe in saving money now in what's best for years to come so if you're having financial problems you may be solicited by credit repair services are companies to settle your debts\nFor pennies on the dollar and it is possible but it's unlikely the costs are high and there are better options now one of the things on the mortgage reports they said is\nYou can't remove derogatory history from credit reports if it's true only if it's air number two debt settlement is risky because it may not work\nYou could end up in court and you could have your credit ruined well I like to change that verbiage you could end up in court and your credit could be ruined now it will be ruined you're not paying your payments you're paying into the hide your pain into this part they're using thousands and thousands of people as leverage to eventually go and try to settle these that's you know after they do so on\nPain into the hide your pain into this pots they're using thousands and thousands of people as leverage to eventually go and try to settle these that's you know after they do so you haven't paid him so long and no you can't qualify for other things so\nYou know you can't remove an accurate information from credit report you can remove are inaccurate information from your credit report yourself or your mortgage lender can help with the rap and resource service which\nNetwork capitals specializes and they're definitely a lifestyle brand the last thing they want to do you know have you guys do as a lot of work to lead you to chasing your tail they're trained specifically on how to help the customer better their credit in their

Nineteen Ninety One as when we first met him the soul man Taylor and his whole family on home improvement\nOn our TV sets even though nobody really calls it that any more at home and I do love the concept of what he played on that show the guide thinks he knows how to fix everything but honestly can't\nOh my God you know he was the ultimate do it yourself\nOver and it's funny we love that show and my mother oddly so I guess this was what in like Nineteen I think the shows on Nineteen Ninety nine Ninety three out of the early nineties yeah\nMy mother was the twin of jail the month and funny she oh she would go to trips to Jamaican get offered free jewelry they thought she was her it was like her doppelganger um person but we definitely were into that show and I\nLoved attendance personality who is great and then the neighbor and the neighbor as well and I think well said yeah that was fantastic\nSo let me ask you a question are you kind of a\nTimid soul man Taylor around the house that tempted to fix things on your own and I and I\nWas going to give them a chance and let them has run first go ahead go ahead you don't I'm not extremely handy but once they're shown something you know shown how to do it I can do it I can do a pretty okay yes I'm a quick learner Shelley what do you think well we do have a handyman okay so in other words that's a necessity got it got it okay yeah [laughter]\nIt it's a necessity I Can't do it all can do to you can't and that's a really good ... sometimes you have to just hired out you know what was going to say is that makes sense to make are too\nBusy here that way too many people come and [laughter] that need retirement home you know for me to me uh on the roof changing the shingle [laughter]\nMakes it a lot of\nThem back to retirement a little bit because yes Tim Taylor was the ultimate do it yourself or an nineties TV but when it comes to planning for our financial future is it okay to do that D I why approach can we get by doing it ourselves\nNot tell you what that's not who are Klein is there not do it yourself first they value and getting professional advice or getting advice from experts who know what they're talking about who could help to\nDo it yourself first they value and getting professional advice show getting advice from experts\nWho know what they're talking about who can help them get educated and get all this information so they can make informed\nDecisions I'll tell you what as a professional who does this day in day out it is hard for us on the other side of the desk to keep up with the ever changing\nTax laws and distribution laws are now um there's even something where armed ... can be potentially pushed out to a later age are all kinds of things that are always changing\nAnd so it's hard for us even as professionals to stay on top of it and I don't know how in the world someone could out their stay on top of it if they're not actually in the ... or want to do that I'll tell you what\nI'm Seventy Seventy five in the last thing I Want to be worried about is my money\nYeah he's a little bit gentler with his response but I Would say absolutely not we do get people that that we talk to you that's how I like to do it myself and we get that it's kind of like a hobby for people\nBut there are a couple of reasons why that's not a great idea and our mind one a lot of the solutions that are so fantastic for retirees are just not available on your own so it's it's it's not that they can't do it if they could they they're not allowed to essentially and have access to those\nAnd that's something that they're kind of missing out on um the second piece is that a lot of times we see the husband is a do it yourself or and then the wife is just kind of along for the ride would have something unfortunately happens to the husband and wife is going to be left with a math um and I don't think that a lot of the people that we see think like in those terms\nBut yeah it's really it's it's such a benefit to have somebody help you out and um I think a real sign of intelligence sometimes is not you know I can do it myself it's I Know what I Can't do fully uh-huh um because you can't do it all and\nI'll tell you what are your clients some of them are smart do you know come in and they say you know what we have to be honest I'm the one that handles finances right and you don't and and my wife doesn't want to make sure that if something happens to me we have a plan in place we have a retirement income plan in place for\nGood times and bad if I go first shoes taken care of vice versa\nAnd meet we meet with physicians we meet with engineers and a lot of engineers we it was really intelligent people who know what they're doing in life but they still do
