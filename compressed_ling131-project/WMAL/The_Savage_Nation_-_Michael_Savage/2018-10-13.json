I. airport\nAnd one of the things we talk about on the show a lot is starting to make businesslike decisions with your money and looking at yourself like a business and so one of the things you wanna get into today is really expanding out on how we help our students\nStart looking at themselves like a business and then start making more systematic more consistent decisions to generate more consistent income for the rest of their lives\nAnd so you know one of the programs that we have that really helps our students are the most serious called the mastermind community and the mastermind community has a number of different services related to it one is a daily market overview for people that are actively trading in the markets there's also a\nOver hundreds of opportunities in what we call the supply and demand grid for over thirty five different assets\nEvery day there are opportunities identified in the stock market identified the futures market identify the forest market identified and options for people that are able to implement income strategies and the various markets\nThere's also a a an opportunity to interact with students from all around the world as well as our instructors and earn truckers are all professional traders and they give people\nAn opportunity to interact with students from all around the world as well as our instructors and orange truckers are all professional traders and they give people the opportunity to start thinking differently about their money\nAnd in this day and age when more and more people are looking for a second stream of income\nWhether it's you know renting out real estate whether it's super driving or you know charging these motor scooters that you see all over the place people are looking for other ways to generate income and there really is no better way to generate income than in the financial markets\nBecause part of this as it's not about giving you another full time job but part of this is how do you fit into your life\nHow do you listen to your schedule and generate income\nCommensurate with that commitment that you're willing to make and you know whatever it whatever it is you know whenever you get paid if you go work a second job you're going to get paid by the hour so maybe you get ten dollars an hour maybe get Fifteen dollars an hour maybe twenty dollars an hour but you really have an upper limit\nOf this is figuring out when are you most productive and so\nThrough our process when people come in decided to become a student at the online training academy you work with an education counselor and what they'll do is really\nUnderstand what it is you're trying to accomplish and why and they'll get to know you and figure out you know what time do you have available for this and certainly have some people come in who have a lot of time control if they work at night where they were tired where they're business owners so they have significant amount of time on a regular basis\nTo focus on generating income and the market I mean one of things we know that everybody needs more income today\nBut one of the benefits of this business is that you have access to markets like the forests market which is a twenty four hour market so basically from Sunday evening to friday evening\nThere's an opportunity for you to set up your trades in the market you can also do it when the markets are closed as well you know for your more longer term trades and so there's opportunities no matter what time of day you're available\nAnd the futures market is similar it's basically a twenty three hour market and you can identify\nHow do you how do you want to be structuring your time towards this particular business and you know what we find is actually the more time you spend\nIt then they can actually work against you so part of what your education counseling will do is actually help you carve out\nThe most effective time for you you know one of things we know that some people are night owls some people are early morning people some people do great in the middle of the day and so based on what time you have available that'll dictate what type of opportunities are looking for\nAlso as you are to generate a building up your own best business in the world it also has to fit you and kind of your style and so if you're you know really hyper kind of short attention span\nYeah there's going to be a shorter term trading will probably makes sense for you\nIf you're more patient than a longer term investing opportunities will make sense for you and there's many markets that you can engage from the forest market to the futures market to the stock market\nAnd understanding how to use options to really leverage or knowledge and leverage your assets to generate income in a safer smarter way and looking at your money a little differently you know you've been conditioned\nTo their accumulation investing model\nIs that you know you just got to build up and build up and you know millions and millions of dollars is what it's going to take and you know we have students that will say oh I Need six million dollars to retire I Need ten million dollars to retire and he Fifteen million dollars to retire and that's true if you can only get three four or five percent on your money\nWas also true is that most people aren't going to have millions of dollars when they retire you know Ninety eight percent of people that retire this year will not have a million dollars and so it's not that the accumulation model doesn't work it just doesn't work for you\nAnd what you need to do is be more active with that money and find better opportunities where you can get the probability on your side we can leverage those assets\nAnd the understand how to manage your risk effectively and manage the risk and such a way that the reward that you're targeting is greater than any risk that you'll ever take\nAnd those three pieces are critical for you as you start building up your do it yourself and best business and you know through our half day clash will be introduced to those and the ability to get probability on your side\nIs critical for people and we have a lot of people come and say I know I Love the markets I just don't know when to get in or when they get out well that's kind of the whole thing\n[laughter] so what one of the things that we have is what we call her core strategy and what that does is allow you to identify safer places to bind safer places to sell with any instrument whether you're going for a short term trades or mid term trades are longer term opportunities\nAnd so by introducing this idea of probability it allows you\nOr mid term trades are longer term opportunities and so by introducing this idea probability it allows you to basically reduce your risk if you're having a higher probability opportunity and so more frequently are going to be successful that'll help you and your overall business strategy\nAnd another thing that will help us figure out not just how to fit the Cindy your schedule but also make sure that your assets are working for you and being more productive when you need them to be productive\nAnd you know my cousin called me a couple of weeks ago and we're talking about strategies and one of the things I introduced him to is that you know being in cash not being exposed to the market is a valid position\nAnd I know when the accumulation model is this idea that you always have to be invested\nAnd they'll say well if you ... if you miss the top ten days in the market each year than you returns will be a lot lower or if you also missed the top ten band days in the market your returns will be a lot higher and so part of it is we want you to be able to make knowing intentional moves with your money\nAnd a big part of treating with like a business and treating your finances like a business is that if you're more intentional our expectation is you're going to have more businesslike returns with your money and if the goal is to be generating current income the goal is to be generating future income\nTo be preserving what you've got\nAnd so what we're going to help you do is develop your own business plan and we've heard of that as your sex success plan and your education your education provider will he'll work with you and help you develop that really figure out what your motivation and what we're really looking for people that are willing\nTo open their mind up to a new approach so you have to be comfortable you have to be willing to accept that there's ways that are different and better than what you're doing\nAnd so being co troubles real important also you know being disciplined not doing whatever you feel like but giving yourself the opportunity to start like applying a systematic approach and think about every business you've ever been involved with\nWhether you started at McDonald's or anywhere else everywhere you go has a system\nLike there's a system for every job function for every business that's operating and so with your money one of the things that will help you do is develop your system for managing your money\nAnd you know by having your own individualized system that's going to allow you more freedom and more flexibility to really take advantage of this best business in the world\nAnd that's where by having your own system that you've proven to yourself works in a safe environment\nThen you're going to have a lot more confidence as you look for opportunities as a key part of how we teach you to become a do it yourself investor is when you're getting started you're going to learn our core strategy but more importantly you're going to actually apply our core strategy live in the markets\nAnd by doing that in a safe environment you're going to be applying the core strategy with our money and so we're putting our money where our mouth is and part of that is it gives you if you're using someone else's asked that we know you're going to be more careful with it\nWhen it comes to people and their own money we realize that people take enormous risks because they really don't care about their money and I know that sounds funny of course I care about my money but the reality is we've we've been doing this for over Twenty years and we've seen that people take more care if someone else's money than their own so\nA key part of our learning experience a key part of becoming a do it yourself investor is learning how to take care of someone else's money when you learn those skills and develop your systematic approach to respecting capital\nThen when you start using your capital you're going to be a lot more systematic a lot more careful and a lot more measured as you're looking for opportunities\nAnd so you know our our system our education system is designed\nTo get you to accept and understand risk and understand how to take advantage of risk and do it at your own pace on your own speed and when you're ready after you build up your confidence you develop your optimism than to start putting it into action and start taking advantage of the opportunities that surround us every single day\nAnd that that's part of what makes this such a great businesses at once you have that approach no one can take it from you\nAnd one of the things we hear all the time here you know no one teaches this in high school known teaches us in college and that's what makes the online training academy such a special place because we're a school for people who want to learn how to make more money\nOr school for people who are looking for income strategies\nTo solve their current income needs as well as their future income needs and there really is no other place like us and so hard about what to do is introduced shoot how we help people like you start developing the skills developing the confidence developing the attitude that you know you deserve\nDid you shoot how we help people like you start developing the skills develop and the confidence developing the attitude that you know you deserve to be able to generate income you need and you don't need to ask someone else permission to be successful\nIt's up to you to put it in the time energy and effort so you can be successful as do it yourself investor\nAnd at one of the things people always talk about is you know time control and his work life balance well if you can make the money you need an hour in the morning and then you have twenty three hours to do what you want that's pretty good time control\nAnd if you want to be successful at this you have to give yourself a opportunity to learn how does this fit into my current lifestyle and we have some students that are actively engaged every single day\nAnd you know they're totally all in their focus not on those folks are tired or preparing for retirement most of our students don't do that you know we have some students at all do this you know twice a week\nAnd they know how I got started in this business so I've been trading for\nAt the time about eight years and I had a ... account with Charles Schwab ... and I got a call and Charles Schwab guy said oh we want to come in and we can review your finances and it's a great here's a guy who really knows what he's talking about life and I'm going to go in and I sit down and my wife comes in\nAnd I sit there and within five minutes so it was like this guy had no idea what I have done and has no idea how to actually make any money right and that was part of my motivation I was like\nThere is a huge opportunity to help people do this the right way yeah\nAnd I've had that happen before too and and even being in the industry myself having worked for a couple of different brokers out of Chicago\nAnd and er an uh well actually both of them were based out of Chicago um you know what a lot of people don't realize is that does financial advisors broker dealers ... you know it's not a good person batteries in conversations more so they have a job to do their job is to put them in the funds that their company needs them to get rid of\nMan generally Hi fi higher expanse and that seemed to me while that's changed over certainly in the last Fifteen Years right but they're the value that you're paying for isn't very high no and and basically you know if you're ... most of the most of what they're trying to give you some it's tracking the market\nBut he ended up not doing as well as the average because the fees and expenses and all these other timing things so they're putting on a below average investment and you get to pay above average fees\nRight and that's not yeah and most of them don't include a the rate of inflation too when you get when you got all of that in a lot of people now start to realize\nWow this is where my money's going and no wonder why I'm not\nWhere I Need to be close just like cable t._v. right I mean if if you paid a hundred dollars a month for cable TV and you only got one channel would you keep paying for it not at all [laughter] right or a veil a once in a while and you would definitely cut the cord\nAnd you know if you're paying for a premium service you expect a premium result exactly and I think that's the fundamental problem is that you're paying for premium service and getting below average results that's right and what a lot of people don't realize is the time commitment that the brokers have nowadays versus\nTwenty thirty forty years ago has been cut in in in third matter of fact they're spending a third of the time managing people's portfolio but still charging the same amount of money that they were way back when and but even let's get back to any other service like\nAny other service that you are paying a premium for if you got bad service what would you do\nYeah when we turn it off yeah right an RV or if you went to a restaurant and they want to charge you a hundred bucks and you got a hotdog what would you do ask for another on a whole bunch of hot dogs and so it's just part of the people have been bamboozled into thinking that they're they're it's okay to pay a premium\nAnd get below average results right and you know and\nAnd the loans long of it is is is one of the things that are students realize you know it it's your money\nAnd you're going to make the decisions you want to and so one of the things that I always tell my students is is you know if if you came here to change and then let let's show you how to do that because obviously um there is room to room for improvement and what a lot of people also realize is\nIs that a lotta times they are doing a lot of things right\nEven if they're making some uh individual decisions but uh if if they if they are at least open minded to tweak a couple of things a little bit my goodness gracious to the the type of strategies that open up for him the type of a [noise]\nUm the opportunities are are are just endless and what a lot of people also realizes that ultimately they might not need that financial advisor\nBroker and that's what makes me do it yourself investors so much fun but to become a do it yourself

investor show thanks to Rob for joining us and part of that is just to give you a a kind of a taste of orange structures\nAnd deal with their perspective and understanding why they want to be part of this community because\nIf you were a Goldman Sachs trader like say you're in the wolf of Wall Street or something like that you're not sitting at home ... rolling out of bed in your pajamas and starting to trade\nOr sort of identify opportunities you're going to put on your best suit you're going to surround yourself with like minded people before you do anything part of your systematic approach to the markets is you're going to reach out to your experts from around the world\nThey're going to allow you to understand what's happening in the markets what's going on out there\nAnd that's why our instructors are part of us as they recognize that if they were by themselves they would just be picked off one by one but by being part of a community by being part of a collective that makes them better and makes them stronger and makes them more likely\nTo be able to generate income for the rest of their lives so that's why people join us so people participate in our mastermind community\nAnd just recognize and where are we in the current market\nAnd you know we've got interest rates are now breaking out and shooting up so if you have a fixed mortgage that may not impact you however if you've ever plan to apply\nFor credit for a new car your credit cards will probably go up so interest rates going up have the potential to impact you but they really have a massive impact on the companies that have been borrowing like mad in the low interest rate environments in the last ten years\nAnd so as interest rates go up and there's some threat to these companies that have been borrowing borrowing and borrowing and the interest that basically they're increased interest bills will impact their ability to use their profits effectively so\nThe increase interest rates will have an impact has already starting to have an impact on the stock market you know J. P. Morgan is moving from growth stocks to what's known as values stock so more kind\nOf consumer staples utilities and part of that is their identifying with higher interest rates kind of a go go days we're going to start slowing down there's going to be less money sloshing around\nAnd so for those who are in passive investments for those of you who are using the accumulation model preservation strategies from the financial services folks you know you're exposed out there to this higher interest rate environment\nAnd not only are interest rates go higher but oil is going higher so an oil goes higher than your gas bill goes higher\nAnd that drives up the cost of other other expenses so as the trade wars continue you know some things have been settled so we have you know the agreements with Canada and Mexico United States but with China\nAs the trade wars continue have some things have been settled so we have you know the agreements with Canada and Mexico United States but with China and other places you know in January ... likely going to be a much higher tariffs on things coming in from China as much as twenty five percent of everything [noise]\nAnd so there is some cost pressures to go with these interest rate pressures which no matter what no matter where you stand on whether it's good or bad you're going to need more money to pay your bills you're going to need more income\nAnd one of the things we know is that life has to do it yourself projects you know all the things you're proud of in life you've done yourself whether it was your education your career\nEven if it was just a project around the house\nAnd those are things that make you feel good those are things that bring a smile to your face you know those are things that make you feel warm inside and when it comes to your income the reality is you're going to need more do you want to feel warm inside about your income strategies do you want to feel warm and decide that\nNo not by the flagship\n...\nKnow when they progress on the ground is eventually make way into the ocean\nCan I enjoy stalemate finds these solid\nWhy they're soda pop bottles\nBags even let go over\nHand I always recycling I'm just going to never trashed proper\nOwe me you walk\nLearn but you can do to keep the peace keepers and cleaned out or\nYou buy the key posts in clean alliance and the guilt [noise]\n\nOh you are they alive and would rich W a male Washington shot one thousand dollar\nOn ... and A L accumulation\n[noise]\nMissing journalist pets are in the U.

six twenty five [noise] love to talk to you were\nAbout why you can't seem to get better and why you keep getting sick and you know it's the time of year where you stay sick all winter long and just don't feel good there's a lot of reasons for it to and\nWe're going to touch on several that you can do something about as I said it is in your hands because so much of it is you know\nThe things that you have ignored forever you know you don't go outside you don't go for a walk you look for the\nClosest parking spot next to the shopping center to the mall and God Forbid that you know something you have to get up and go into another room do something you're you're you're you yell out honey you know whether it's you know your whoever and you say bring me what he can't even get a few but\nYou know kids are locked into their their devices they don't move anymore they're eating so much junk you know their vegetables or unheard of you have to sneak them in your kids by giving them smoothies in the morning or even yourself because you want to take the time to get it done [noise]\nYou know it's it's a frustrating challenging pattern for me when I see people who could make life a whole lot easier for themselves and they don't they\nFind every reason every story why they can't which by the way a reason or story as an excuse in my book\nSo think about your stories and think about your reasons and a parallel that ah you got that excuse that as your way of approaching all kinds of things it's not okay so you know you have\nThings that you end up with and you don't seem to be able to get a handle on it and you say well this time of the year and I know I'm going to get sick\nWell that's the other side of the trial had you know the emotional side that says well I'm going to get what am I get because I'm going to get it done you know this is what I expect to have and you become a self fulfilling prophecy it's incredible how that happens\nYou know the opposite piece by the way as a as a positive attitude and you can go in and you can check out\nAll kinds of sites and you can ... a on kind of positive attitude keep you well can positive thinking keep you well\nWell there's a lot of correlations between how your mind works and the expectation that you have and what happens to your body you know you will attract you those things that\nCan make a difference in many of you know that I traveled with a guy named Tony Robbins for many years and took care of him and his family and I'm not telling stories out of school right now but [noise] you know he has as part of his keynote says four day program unleash the power if within\nHe has this interesting metaphor that he does on the first night it's called fear into power the fire walk experience so if I asked you listen\nTo open your oven and the ... the ovens on foreign degrees and I want you with out anything on your hand that wants to pull the great out with your fingers and you would look at me and say are you out of your freaking mind you know I'm gonna get hurt but\nBetter yet let's go outside in the parking lot and there's two feet by\nFifteen feet of two thousand degrees of hot burning coal and we're going to take our shoes and socks off and we're going to walk across that and again you think that I've lost my absolute board in telling you I'm suggesting they feel that we would do that\nWell the truth of it is in the eight years I traveled with him I had the opportunity to do that probably\nAbout Fifteen times so Fifteen foot fires and twenty foot fires and forty foot fires and I've never had a paying spot on my foot how is that possible is a mind over matter absolutely it is your mind\nYou're mine has a capacity to resolve to turn around to sex virtually anything that happens to your body when you get into a negative spin no matter what it is you will produce that ultimately\nLouise Hay was one of the most amazing and prolific writers when it comes to how the body responds to mental thought and uh if you will attitude and you know she's ... she wrote\nHuge lay on the subject of you know what happens when you have hate in your heart when you have don't confuse me with the facts I'm not going to move away from you know where I Am right now and the health conditions that ensue because of that when somebody is hateful\nSomebody as vengeful they're the ones that end up with the tumors they're the ones that end up\nAnd the health conditions that ensue because of that when somebody is hateful\nSomebody as vengeful they're the ones that end up with the tumors they're the ones that end up with the cancers when somebody is stuck in their position that they don't want to change their approach their attitude\nYou have mixed membranes are that also have two words you off the mouth produces enzymes like ... and ... and they begin the process of breaking things up but they also triggered the intestinal tract to help\nSo those are our ... our primary uh situation so people who have predispositions right now and we're seeing more of them in our practice\nTo mold and spores and things that nature are really suffering the sheer and we're in a in another part of the uh early on that you're already seeing different types of viruses and there's like two hundred different viruses that are out there\nAnd it's affecting the lymph nodes it's affecting the sinus membranes people are getting fevers or it's and then it's settling into the lung and this is what we've noticed now over the last thirty days in our practice so\nWe have to you know if you want to deal with those without having to take a hammer and what I'm Talking about getting the hammer\nThe steroids and the antibiotics and you know the ... things of that nature you have to begin to shift what's going into that structure called the human body so we want to make sure that we dumb down the amount of sugars that are going in our system we want to make sure that we're drinking tons of water clear water put a little laminate put a little line that\nWe want to make sure that we're getting vegetables you know that have a tremendous amount of minerals and enzymes in her body [noise]\nThose things will help as well as you know if you want to be proactive\nA an upper regulate the immune system a\nManual manipulation acupuncture a very specific herbal ingredients as wild ... plus the ones that I've talked about can do a great job and begin to reverse a lot of this paid a lot of diseases individualistic as well it depends on the person guns on their background so\nBut generally speaking if you you know you want to help yourself\nA start taking a whole bunch of vitamin C. about a thousand milligrams three to four times a day but spread out over a period of time\nYou know that's not going to hurt your vitamin C. is water soluble I'm making ... if you're if you're a cave rats and had been all summer long your vitamin D levels probably around your toenails or you need to start taking some day\nEchinacea as an herb that stimulates the bodies immunological reactions are within the system and also think we do a zinc tally test on every patient that walks in their office and about eighty percent of the people that walk in there's zinc levels are very low why is that important because zinc works actively to help\nDefend the body from viral invasion so those are little things that can be done so ... I Hope that helps you a little bit but that's a that's what we're looking at and and that's what's happening and we can be of more help\nYou know obviously ... child and a love to give you some more information\nAAA six zero nine six two fathers AAA six three zero nine six two five you're listening to Dr timers alive runs Saturday today at four o'clock why simply because of the fact that the red skins are playing at home usually where the here on Sundays as many of you know we've been here for\nAn excessive about sixteen Seventeen years same old place and same old ... but you know\nThe red skins when and we're here but at least we're here for you and you can always get a hold of us and ask 'cause any question that you'd like to have we have a great a bunch of people that can help you with\nAnything that might be going on all you have to do is go to ... care dot com that's R. S. E. L. L. E. C. A. R. E. ... take a look around and insight into another website just Dr Tom Roosevelt dot com the R. T. O. M.\nR. O. S. E. L. L. E. dot com and lots of learning therefore you're in if you go a down you're going to see\nA way to link into other radio programs and they're all tags relative to topic and I think that you enjoy that [noise]\nAh want to remind you that October is\nA breast cancer awareness month and\nWe're offering through demography centers of Fairfax in their painter being\nAh the person that you need to reach out to um a twenty percent just got an all breast from our graffiti look it up its um Mehdi ... I met ether arm is out said that\nAh for effects are up to my son has works with and there's a group of doctors and so they do is they read these far better ladies than being exposed to mammography radiation and having very soft tissue or squeezed and then radios remember who said forty\nFive pounds of weight goes on that breast and it's not okay particularly when you know that radiation is cumulative and it begins to you know they predispose the body to things that you don't want to have to think about it and as highly preventable in many cases [noise]\nWe're talking about how to keep yourself well when you can get well when you can't get better as you said that you know the CDC constantly upgrade his information but it really\nAnd get well when you can't get better as you said that you know the CDC constantly upgrade says information but it really doesn't give you the whole truth and I need you to make sure that you read between the lines as the tough questions\nAnd you know when you get into depression this time of year a lot of us simply because of the fact that there is no son and a lot of you simply you know have a real sweet tooth root coming into the sweet season\nStarting with Halloween and then we go to Thanksgiving and then we go to the holiday season of\nChristmas and Hanukah and you know all the other things and then New Year's eve and then by the time the middle of January comes along we are sick people we do not feel good we don't like to go out anymore because oh my God this little too cold outside\nAnd I can't walk when it's cold outside I can stretch when it's cold outside [noise] um I think you need to rethink that I think you need to you know put a different look on the subject\n... because if you do little things you can make a whole lot better for yourself and between your attitude members structural chemical emotional\nBut to tell me doc I keep getting colds and we said earlier that like to to for a year and you shouldn't get any of them and\nYou know we're talking about the average number of colds two to four if I don't get any how many of you get my ... my share of it right just like I said\nAs far as sugar you know for getting a hundred and Seventy pounds of sugar per person per year and I'm lucky if I get a little bit ah who's getting my share of that stuff you know it's you can take mine and you know you can deal with it I don't want this stuff but you know here go and you know then can I get a cold twice in a row\nThe ... the\nUm answer is yes but it's a different virus and viruses mutate and sort of flu bugs and things of that nature so you know when you ... that's another thing when you go get the flu shot [noise] it's not necessarily the one for the flu that's out there because it mutates so rapidly and that's one of the reasons that the effectiveness rate is so so low\nSo you got to do things on your own to make a difference you know when you get a fever you know with a cold or if it's viral is going to be about a hundred and one Ninety nine point age you know maybe I'll get up to a hundred and two it starts cranking up to a hundred and two or more and stays higher than that maybe a bacterial problem\nAnd you need to do things but you know you get that runny nose and congestion follow along by you know\nFour or five days of body aching and so forth well\nThere's things that you can do to make a difference and a is you know as long as you haven't gotten into a respiratory system there's homeopathy fix their those things like us as silly and we've talked a little bit about zinc we talked a little bit about vitamin D and and so forth\nBut you really need to understand that it's because your body is becoming more susceptible because of your neglect\nAnd not stepping up to the plate the way you should you know\nI Wish I could have you all live with me for a very short period of time and show you what you really can do to keep yourself strong [noise] we had patients that come into the office had been sick for decades and now they they came in for\nDifferent reasons other than I don't feel good but they hurt their and paying their you know they've had migraines for years and we've set them of course the care that allows them to reverse the problem over a period of time and\nThen they start saying you know hey doc I didn't get sick they sure do you think this had anything to do with that well they asked for the day is that if you're nervous system is working properly it's going to stimulate all your immunological responses within the body\nAnd it's going to make a difference in how your body reacts and defend yourself you know if you're putting up with\nThings you can't move as easily as you should if you putting up with\nThings like you have this neck and had that bother you almost daily you're putting up with things where your hands are tied the tells you neurologically structure things aren't working the way they're supposed to [noise] and you know if you find that's happening you need to get some professional manual\nManipulative adjusted care to your nervous system and maybe add that to some occupy ensure and maybe add that to exercise\nTheir researchers found at Appalachian State university you know this is going back to two thousand ten they followed more than a thousand adults in the fall and winter monitoring their activity level and the rates are and then they compared to the rates of upper respiratory infections and\nA flows and so forth and what they found was that\nPeople who got exercise on a regular basis had a much much lower rate of being sick and staying sick than people who just ignored their bodies and didn't do anything about you know anything in their life\nSo you know you put them you know in a place where they are getting exercise that all by itself stimulates bothers him a logical response and make things better you know you'll get better faster\nA place where they are getting exercise that all by itself stimulates bodies in the logical response and make things better you know you'll get better faster believe it or not when the temperature drops so why is it that you get sick when
