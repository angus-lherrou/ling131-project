don'ts for the financial markets big science or sponsors Tom laundry academy generous contributions to make a show possible online training\nAcademy has been helping individuals like you become ... yourself investors since Nineteen Ninety seven\nOnline training Academy of two campuses to serve our listening audience one and Tyson's corner and one near BWI Airport and now that we have market volatility back we're getting people in with a lot more conviction and a lot more motivation\nTo prepare themselves for the markets volatility markets up to the markets dams guy so a week ago when the market was plummeting down ten percent we have people came in and they saw there's a real threat to their wealth\nAnd you know if your money and a four one K. your money is always at risk\nAnd it's taking these markets hits you very rarely get the nice bounce back on the upside and for most folks just to realize we're at\nThat ... you know during this week if you had all of your money in the S P five hundred then you'd be lucky to be a break even and then then you have to subtract out the fees and expenses which makes it less likely that you would even be a break even for the year\nAnd so when you're taking a look at this from a long term perspective and look at it from a business person you know you're going to have appears in down years but why on earth would you allow that to happen to be philosophical about it okay what did you want to be able to learn is there a way that I can protect what I've got\nTo take some steps to actually be making progress on a regular basis in the market\nAnd for a lot of our students they come to us because they have assets and they're tired of this roller coaster\nA regular basis in the market and for a lot of our students they come to us because they have assets and they're tired of this roller coaster and you were able to get complacent over the last few years over the last few years market didn't do a whole lot so you're able to sit back and relax and you know see what might happen but\nYou know this year has been very clear from February and April into June and to September and October the gums are happening and so these guys for the warning signs that at a moment's notice the folks with money are going to want to protect themselves and so part of being a do yourself investor\nIs realizing that one of the most important things you can do is learn how to protect the capital of you've worked so hard for\nMe right you know you've earned that capital by the sweat of your brow you pay taxes on the capital and then you have to defend that capital from all those things and wine and spend money on it\nGenerate income from the market for over Twenty years now and we've been in the DC Baltimore market for eleven years and part of that as we've seen the ops who've seen the dams and we're approaching a spot where those downs are pretty likely\nAnd to also recognize that you know there's opportunities as the market goes down if you learn how to position your assets more effectively\nAnd you know part of it is you know we've been brainwashed to focus on the stock market and there's certainly opportunities in the stock market and if you love the stock market\nThat we have programs that you can use to focus on that but for most of our people as they start positioning their assets differently it's taking a look at things like for X. or things like futures or even just how can I get insurance on my current portfolio how can I protect what I've got\nOr more significant way how can I be generating income from what I've got without the market risk because ... you know with the market in a high volatility area you don't have to participate in it\nThere's things that you can do to remove stock market risk from your whole portfolio and if you're worried about it yeah you can remove that mark a risk and then develop some strategies that don't rely on the stock market to generate more income\nThat sounds like a winning combination when you're worried about what's going on the stock market\nAnd the folks that we see aren't particularly confident that this has got to keep going up to ... billion ride the market is already told us it's kind of stalled out crashed and and what we need to do is recognize the markets talking to us you know the people with money are talking to us and the key is do you know what they're telling you\nDo you understand the message that they are giving you and are you able to take action based on the message that they're giving you and so that's what we help our students to at the online trading academies understand that you know there are always opportunities around us the key is to position ourselves so that we have the right frame of mind\nAnd we have our money in a safer and smarter place and so if we want to you know we can use the strategy that Sam side and talked about a few weeks ago and remove all stock market risk and at the same time get the benefit of stock market gains when they appear\nAnd with Sam talked about was basically having money in a diversified bond portfolio and using the interest from those bonds to buy call options on the stock market you know ... five hundred or something else and use that to generate potential upside\nBut with no stock market risk\nWe can do similar things\nAnd expose ourselves to other markets if we don't like the stock market upside so we can still have our money outside and absorb no stock market risk to generate income and then we can buy call options on other assets that you know seem to have the wind that their back\nAnd so we know oil right now is they're charging up you know we've got excitement in the middle east or got excitement and other oil producing nations we've got a public policy that his focus on driving the price of oil up\nAnd so in that case you know maybe that's\nA strategy that you could use to help protect yourself and give you some peace of mind and it's part of positioning your money away from the the high risk in the stock market but still give you the opportunity for beneficial returns\nAnd so part of what we help you do start looking at your money differently and start thinking bigger about the opportunities around you\nSo you don't have to be a victim of whatever the market throws at us next and you know we're starting to see you know people steps are quick and ... you know they see that the end is near\nBut people aren't willing to take a position\nWhere they're protecting themselves right now\nWell that's the perfect time to start protecting yourself you know as the market charges up again this is the perfect time if you weren't if you didn't get your\nWell that's the perfect time to start protecting yourself\nYou know as the market charges up again this is the perfect time if you weren't if you didn't get your money out of harm's way the last time this might be a great time to do that\nAnd then start learning about alternative ways that you couldn't use your capital to generate safer and smarter returns without stock market risk because that's where you know\nWith the stock market where it is now with the volatility ever present and be on with the upside really kept unlimited based on what's going on in the environment than we probably need to start looking at some other ways to generate income going forward\nParticular as we head into the new year and as we start seeing you know the trade policies talk kicking in it's going to have a real significant impact on our consumer based economy and if you look around\nThere's a lot of retail spaces that are empty now there's a lot of bacon shops that are have been available for a lot longer than they used to be\nAnd if if you were there back in two thousand eight two thousand nine if you were there and two thousand two thousand one if you were there and Ninety to Ninety three right you saw the same sort of thing where all of a sudden this commercial real estate there was less appetite for it\nAnd that was the beginning of those are the canaries in the coal mine\nAnd so as the canaries in the coal mine are giving us a message we need to be able to listen to them and take action based on it and so what we're looking for the online training academy or people that see these canaries and want to do something about it\nAnd folks that are ... you know willing to learn a new way of thinking and and have a higher aspirations for their assets than the conventional approach [noise]\nWell we're looking for folks that you don't believe that they can do better you know they've gotten to where they've gotten in life through hard work\nThrough their brain power and we want you to do is bring that hard work bring that brain power and apply it to your own financial assets so instead of making money for someone else we want you to use your hard work and use your assets to make money for you\nOkay and that's really the core of being a do it yourself investor is taking a hard look at you know what have you been trained to do and most people have been trained to be an employee\nAnd most people have been trained to work for someone else and that's certainly where I started and you know there's some benefits to working for someone else as far as responsibility and focus\nBut at the same time\nEveryone should also have an aspect of their life of their financial life that they have control over and I think that's part of the allure of a lot of the personal finance ... personal finance approaches that you know you may work for someone else but here's some things you can do to manage your own money\nAnd my concern with most of it is it is like most of the personal finance advice assumes that you're in a static world assumes you only have one stream of income\nIn assumes that you're not getting a raise in assumes that you know wherever you are as good as it gets and then you just have to hope and pray that nothing happens between now and the time you turn a hundred and maybe you'll have accumulated enough um that you will run out\nAnd to me the whole accumulation model is you know it works if you've got multiple millions of dollars but for most people it's not the best way for you to use your money and maybe maybe it is when you're busy maybe it is when you don't have time to focus on your money maybe it's important when you don't care enough about your money\nBut when you realize the power of your capital and realize that your capital can provide for you right now to supplement your income or replace your income or that your capital can generate income for the rest of your life then if you start appreciating the power of the capital\nThen you have to realize that what you're doing following the personal finance monitors are really kind of selling your short\nAnd particularly if you're a smart person who's made their way with hard work isn't it worth it to learn about how do you take that intelligence how do you take being a smart person couple that with your hard work and apply in the financial markets\nAnd you know with that so we're looking for folks that are willing to learn a new way of thinking about their money there will be comfortable\nAnd significantly are motivated to make a change in her motivated to take control of their income and I recognize there's times in life where you're really busy right you're starting a new career you're starting a family\nBut there's also times in life where you can carve out a couple of hours a week\nOr a couple of hours a month and use that time more productively and if you could do that and do it in a way where you're building income for the future and build more important building you're hoping confidence that you'll be able to generate the income you need for the rest of your life than that as a a good one\nBuilding income for the future and build more important building your hope and confidence that you'll be able to generate the incoming need for the rest of your life than that as a a good way for it to use your time energy and effort and if you're willing to learn that than we want to meet you\nAnd if you want to start getting the perspective of becoming a do yourself investor then give yourself a opportunity open yourself up\nTo learn about you know specifically how to start treating her capital with respect to how to get out of harm's way and more importantly how you can start getting some returns that aren't based on the stock market\nYou know the stock market is a high risk adventure normally it's absolutely a high risk venture right now and you don't have to be there there are alternative places for you to generate income and do it so he can sleep at night and do it so in a safer and smarter way than what everybody else is doing\nAnd you know and it got to ask yourself of everybody else is doing it\nNow doing things that are are like selling insurance are working at Wal Mart or something right now and uh you know I I was able to survive and thrive and and the and I love it I still love trading I still am enthusiastic getting out of the bed every morning and excited\nAnd we're seeing a lot of people are looking for that purpose and they've had successful businesses they had a career they're ready to make a transition and all of a sudden they need a place to comments a lot of those folks come to mind training academy\nYeah and that's the beauty of of this uh experience and and the skill set because all it is is learning new skills I tell my students all the time I said yeah you may from thirty thousand feet may look complicated and this and that it's really not\nAnd uh it's just a matter of learning the skill sets a I couldn't learn what they do for a living very quickly um\nAnd the good news it's you know there's nothing I'm teaching them that none of them you know they all have the capacity to learn there's nothing I deliver\nThat as you know over the top but as far as being able to absorb the simple math and uh just recognizing the opportunities they present themselves in the market to based on um a historical price\nYou know what's so funny my twelve year old took the course when he was eleven and I said Thomas how was it and he said oh it was great\nAll I have to do is follow the steps but the funny thing was he was in there with a lot of fifty sixty Seventy year old and he said I Can't understand why they can't do it they just have to follow the\nClosest that when he took it again this year and he was basically like an ... assistant instructor with another twelve year old that was helping everybody to just implement put it into action\nAnd just take advantage of the opportunity yeah\nI think you know the young kids get it\nAnd easier uh not just the the software challenges a which are so great but again it's learning new systems I couldn't go into any business and learn you know the system is very easily but um it's also that\nPeople of of uh\nAre even though the ban stage of age thirty on on up they've been poisoned their whole life they've been taught all the wrong things from Wall street that the\nWall Street somehow managed to convince people they should do things counter to what they do for themselves\nA as consumers in other words\nThey they talk about buying things when they're going up in price and be fearful of buying when they go down now what business could possibly make money doing that and so the people he valiant [noise] yeah exactly and so you know people believe that uh they need to know a lot about a particular company and to buy things when they're going up a that's not what we teach\nAnd let's go back and we have just have a minute or so votes go back to them when I first met in two thousand seven the market was getting to all time highs at the time and that was the beginning of a pullback so what do you see similar today that you saw from two thousand\nSeeing a number of the things are over the years and then two thousand outside on a new recall the subprime or information was out there you know\nI'm On the market is interesting because it doesn't pay attention to certain things until it's done and I'm you know it wasn't until bears turns in Lehman Brothers are a little out of it all the sudden everything went into freefall\nAnd and so we know or something like this is only going to happen again we we've had a great run your nine you're you're a bull market are excellent so at some point we're going to backtrack no one can predict when but it will happen and I think and that was interesting I had a call last night from the students so\nUm I hadn't ... unseen for over a year year and the last thing they said to me it was talking about going on in the mastermind community and which is our highest level of education dish and he said pray I have to tell you the most important thing\nI'm pulling out and this education\nThere's a level of education dish I mean suddenly tell you the size of the most important thing\nI'm pulling out of this education is is not necessarily how to take advantage of his moves up and down the risk management skills who says that's worth its weight in gold is worth every penny of bad for the education most fun I couldn't agree with them more because of what\nWe know to be an effective do yourself investor you need to get educated so called a seven seven three zero for eight seven to three seven seven three zero for trade horrendous drama free OJ class ... three O T class ...\n[noise] [noise] nah\nAt online training academy our mission is whopper exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills or even just having the luxury of not working so hard\nTo have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share but that's all kinds of stories here's what one recent graduate had to say\nI bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years and I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed I time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... happy and career and try to something that I had always wanted to death and now is that a diet but at a chemical or start that changed my life\nLearned more visit us on line that free O T a class on Tom that's free OTC a class dot com [noise]\nAnd it's not just your life is something that ah you pass on to your children of your friends and they're\nWelcome back to do it yourself investors show and Craig gives us some pretty valuable advice about the importance of remaking yourself and recognizing when changes upon us\nAnd right now in the market you know change is upon us and we can do nothing and see what happens\nAnd we we've seen that happen before and the results weren't so good\nOr we can learn how to evaluate opportunities and be able to shift our focus to take advantage of the opportunities presented to us you know the market is always moving and as a do it yourself and best or\nYou know you can allow allow yourself to ride the roller coaster or more importantly you can get yourself out of harm's way and still focus on finding safer and smarter ways to generate income and so\nYou know Craig was involved with the markets for years [noise]\nA new a little bit about trading right he'd been they made his way for thirty five years in the pits in Chicago\nAnd what he did was he recognized the need to learn a new way of generating income from the market so you know Craig came to us and he was co trouble you know he didn't know what all\nEven though he knew an awful lot and so for you you probably don't have the same experience that Craig had\nWhich makes it even more important for you to start learning the mechanics of the market and learning how you can start generating safer and smarter returns in the market as do yourself investor and just recognize where we are it's October\nAnd you know the market is usually telling us what's gonna happen six months down the line and you know we have some a number of changes that will probably come our way in the near future and so we need to prepare for them\nAnd whether it's the election whether it's the tariffs with China you know there's going to be some major changes coming\nAnd the word consumer based economy and you know the use of tariffs as an assault on consumers and the policies that our government is pursuing an assault on consumers similar to the same assault we saw from two thousand and one to two thousand eight\nWhere you know the price of oil shot up from twenty dollars a barrel to hundred twenty dollars a barrel\nAnd you know we're heading that same direction their interest rates are going up that we got a lot of crack showing the foundations\nSo now it's up to us to do something about it and one of the things I Need to challenge you say you know with the one thing we can count on him and his change you know the one thing we know that that's going to keep happening is change so how do we educate ourselves to cope with that change\nAnd that part of being a do yourself investors be able to recognize the changes in the market so you can change where your assets are get yourself out of harm's way learn how to protect what you've got and then\nSo the changes in the market so you can change where your assets are get yourself out of harm's way learn how to protect what you've got\nAnd then start positioning and the way we can start generates safer and smarter returns and so a lot of folks are coming to us with the million dollar portfolios hundred thousand dollar portfolios because they recognize they lost a lot of money in a week ago\nAnd if you if you're not in her rights while you could lose a whole bunch more\nAnd but we want you to do is get your money out of there\nAnd recognize that being cash is a valid position\nAnd then you have to do is develop some strategies where you can use your money to generate safer and smarter returns for the rest of your life\nYou know that's what this has become a do or self investors you know allow you to do and you know our perspective is that life is it do yourself project right all the things that you're proud of in life\nTaking people was wise to where\nWe build and repair runways all kinds of terrain under all kinds of conditions to keep our

I'm not one\n... middle shovels to it at all of that is a ... way up protesting against the government and then another point I'd rather make aims\nIt has more on what the point that much you don't put 'em damage\nA ... on the way up with that same day you're damaging property that is a wrong we'll protesting ... it is very wrong\nI I I don't support any team actually I've lived here for the Trump I'm I'm happy that he was elected president but I saw it for I left off he just moved to devote time out some of them are old yeah use in the olden days mentality\n... government not in line with what is good no car I blew we just used to so\nThat that is a metaphor to David that'll every individual\nThat's up to every individual um you know district or state if it's a senator or whatever to to make that determination but it goes but I just want to say something\nIt goes beyond damage if you if I if I'm sitting in a restaurant I don't want people marching into that restaurant and causing a scene and and threatening violence and even if they don't break anything they're upsetting me I I might leave I mean I I Can't imagine a restaurant owner would appreciate it either it's got to be against the law\n[laughter] I mean if I go to the director I should be able to have\nOh\nI mean if I go to the director I should be able to have\nThe fact that they're all under care of and I've got four thousand or some cross ... cinder Guatemala as the Mexican border seeking to break into the into into Mexico and then from there and to the United states\nWhat that message center says to the American people look this is what is coming for ever if you do not get control of your borders\nThis is what you can expect if you can stop it the next caravan will be larger than the next caravan larger than that now are you going to stop this or you're going to let the people outside come in and who might be destitute are angry repressed are you going to let them determined the character of your nation\nAnd if you're not how are you going to deal with it and stop 'em so I think it's a tremendous opportunity for the president here to show real leadership and if necessary real action to prevent this caravan from entering the United states\nYeah I I could not agree with you more or a hundred percent now who do you think I mean there have been accusations on both sides although I think the the accusations of the Republicans who say this was orchestrated by\nIf not George Soros certainly some some group or with the left is ties because just to have all these people all of a sudden wake up and up here on that bridge and start start their their trek across a you know four thousand miles and then the Democrats answer back and say no Trump orchestrated you for the reasons you just alluded to\nUs so who do you think how do you think it all came about\nWell you know I'm sure there's an element of spontaneity there but I agree with you\nThere's an element of organization and all of these you've got to coyotes down there you got people who believe\nWho obviously believe an open borders who really sees upon this and encourage them and urge them to go forward and somebody's gonna have to help move them across Mexico\nI made against their will I think now the Mexican government so I I think there's spontaneity there there's the idea that look we can do it that the Americans can't control their border\nAnd so in that sense it's better to movement and most of these movements I think ultimately gain some kind of a chart direction\nYeah All right now let me ask you about them and talking to Patrick Jay Buchanan here with the ... W. M. A. L. uh on on Saturday were alive or let me ask you about this whole Saudi\nSaying I'm you know I I hear the left saying and and and this is going to be the case and I'm digressing a little bit here\nSomeone's going to get hurt with what's going on here and I'm not talking about you but someone's going to get hurt or God Forbid there's an assassination like like a Rand Paul alluded to as a possibility he fears McConnell\nGot confronted in and and shout out of a restaurant in Louisville yesterday last night uh it goes on and on and on\nThe script is already written no matter what happens to matter who gets hurt it's some small I heard the left yesterday Murray accord don't on CNN saying Trump's language led to a shaggy getting killed um what's your take on all this and what should\nThe United states do in reaction to\nWhat happened and what the Saudis story is\n[noise] I'll tell you what to let me talk first about the what they did to Mitch McConnell\nThese matters has been repeated and repeated and repeated made in your face in Salt to members of Congress members of the Senate confronting people at dinners diners and are trying to get them thrown out\nAnd sort of getting at a ... nasty physical presence in front of people and that's one of the world that sort of it is a new fashioned tactic man even go back to the global what he did a back in the Nineteen twenties and disrupting thing and\nAnd I think it's I I agree that something's going to happen\nThat subject violence going to happen and it's got to be an incentive to suddenly hits the headlines and I tell you I think the American people are going to look at who did it and they're not going to buy into this idea that it's because you know Trump's rallies or exciting and people are here and\nSo I think the the left is really in danger of doing to chop what it did fifty years ago in Nineteen Seventy campaign when we called him radical liberal for encouraging violence in for urging crowds and men courage and anti war demonstrations I got out of control that Israel Nixon built the new majority\nTo on that that's my view is the leftist playing with fire that got it burnt a long time ago\nThat won't cut it made it to ice my view is it's one of two things either they say\nBurnt a long time ago though and cut throaty made it I my view is it's one of two things either they it was a botched up darkened rendition to getting back at the Saudi Arabia\nAnd they killed him or they weren't in deliberately to kill him intact body out that to my view of it but\nThis was done in a Turkish in Turkey was done in Saudi in a society consulate was done by shouting not by Americans nobody believes the Americans ordered it so I think what they're Americans have to do is stand out and condemnation\nOf whatever comes out whether the truth comes out say what we believe\nBut I don't believe you can terminate relations with Saudi Arabia over this incident dreadful that it is I mean we have to deal with God during World War two we had to deal with Joseph Stalin does a treasured ally\nYeah yeah and we and we can't allow Iran to take over the middle east and and and and I mean that says that you can't let them play in that backyard unchallenged\nWill I Will say this maybe will report company I'm not the least bit frightened of Iran I think Iran is scared to death of a war with the United states\nThey got a great break when Bush went in there and October the Taliban are tested the Iranian regime then we're not Tobar Saddam Hussein who had attacked the Iranian regime\nAnd so I think in some ways the United states has really maple Iran to expand its influence both in Iraq and Afghanistan and across the middle east but the idea that they want a war with the United states\nI think it's mistaken I think they're terrified of it you're going to major war with the Americans and you will smash up that country so badly will come apart into four or five pieces like Iraq and Syria are\nYeah I always worry about a ... about the um taken down the grid you know whether it's Iran or some rogue country but that's that's neither here nor there let me ask you one more you know you and I to a certain extent maybe different degrees at this point but nonetheless uh we could be\nCalled old white men what did you make what Julian\nAssange volition you wants to but I think it said to me more than you\nKnow well you know I'm getting up there but but but I but I appreciate that but but listen they Kavanaugh or analysis was not the first time the media and the left went on with this old white men or when Susan Rice was going to be interviewed by the by a committee\nBob ... they all said oh the optics of old white men with an African American woman old white men and they say with such disdain like old white men and women in the cabinet case it has nothing to do with race whatsoever and they still brought it up every chance they get what what what is the goal there and Ken Ken\nThe G O P and the ... if the midterms or at least Trump than the general election should they make an issue of that\nWell I think the the way this going to take care of itself I mean people\nWho who ... I mean when you cut on the television and people are calling you names the way that you know say sixty years ago African Americans were called names because of who they were in the south or places like that\nAnd people said that you know that's in decent and it's intolerable we're going to change that I think there's going to be a reaction certainly in the and the white community there's going to be a lot of decent folk to people of color are going to say you don't watch with all this\nYou know take a defining the person by his color or his range rather than what you're saying and what he believes and what his ideas are what are the arguments are so I think that's one of the reason Trump is president because\nOf a ... awful lot of folks felt look you know that the Trump at least standing up and saying the calling us name because we're wife is wrong and he's getting in their face and smack middle we're delighted\nThere's a there's a point at which when white folks return minority as they are or they're a minority in states like Hawaii California New Mexico now in touch\nAnd that's becoming true in state after state after they take her on the aspect of a minority which is they tend to stand on her hind legs and fight\nAnd as a group and as a sort of a people and that's that's my fear what's gonna happen to the country is when we become a major uh minorities all minorities oh how are you what brings us together\nAs well you know what that's a a question that will be answered at another time because it certainly has no simple answer pat\nI Can't tell you how we missed our conversations on the air and I can't tell you how happy I was that you were able to do today on a Saturday and God Bless you and your lovely wife and uh hopefully we'll speak again very soon\nPatients on the air and I can't tell you how happy I was that you were able to do today on a Saturday and God Bless you and your lovely wife and uh hopefully we'll speak again very soon", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington", "day": "20"}
