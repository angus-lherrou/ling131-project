something together this year first place Washington Redskins huge whenever the cowboys will see at Thanksgiving pilots get to the uh they're calling it a caravan still\nA caravan 'cause you know by the way in England\nThey call an RV or a camper they refer to a camper as a carrot and did you know that's what they call it that that's that's the or do you know 'cause they they do things like they called the trunk of a car boot and they call a bathroom the new and they call an elevator to lift and I don't even want to tell you what they call cigarettes I'll get in trouble\nAnd they call a camper the actual like at like if you pull a camper that you're going to you know go camp out in uh they they call it a Caribbean and apparently we call an invasion of foreigners a caravan as well the\nMedia is calling it a caravan or even the government is calling it the caravan the Trump Administration will revert to the Caribbean President Trump right now is a ... doing a big key when I was

sometimes as soon as we get the tape we're going to play it for you because we know he's addressing the issue with the caravan\nAh it why they're calling it a care about and I don't know I Love what she'll be call it by the way I was gonna gonna throw that out there but I'm pretty sure everybody would agree with me that it's an invasion\nSo that that wouldn't be a real fun half hour of just taking a bunch of people calling in saying we should call it an invasion so let's just agree on that they're invading our country they're making no bones about it and the trouble is it it's one of those things where I think we Republicans conservatives\nAre tend to get very shy and very uh embarrassed and very reluctant to engage with our friends in a conversation about this if they happen to disagree or if they happened to not really know the facts on the ground\nAh but as we continue this conversation with your friend who might not agree with you on the border because they haven't really thought about it or if they agree that you have a right to enforce your border then you say okay so so why do we think that these people should be coming in here\nAnd when they say well they're ... they're refugees and they're seeking asylum you can then calmly explained to them that are fleeing a crime in your country is not a legitimate claim for asylum no international standard supports that\nNo international body supports that in our country has never signed onto a treated the support that [noise] and seeking a better economic life is not a legitimate grounds for asylum\nSo so they're they're playing fast and loose with the term asylum they're playing very fast and loose with the definition of refugee\nListen these are people who live in a terrible country with a terrible government with terrible crime and terrible economic conditions that also describes the majority of people in the world\nAs soon as we started granting refugee status and offering asylum to everyone who meets that condition we're no longer a country\nWe're no longer a country and and if if we can have that same rational conversation and we should be fine I Would suspect that it's by this time in your conversation with your friend who might disagree with you or or may have posted something outrageous on Facebook about this I suspect it's at this\nMoment where they start saying that Trump said the Mexicans were all rapists and Trump just hates brown people and and you know what at that point you just smile and say okay well we're done or done but thanks for talking about it you know this far with me and hopefully I've giving us something to think about\nI don't get your reaction on this in a moment that you tell me do you see another scenario where this is playing out but to me were either having a violent confrontation of the border or Trump acquiesce as and let's see thousands of people in or third way\nThere's a diplomatic solution involving Mexico involving the UN and international government bodies and that is resolved before it ever reaches our border that's when I Hope happens here\nAnd we actually do solve this problem because that ultimately I Do actually want to solve this problem I don't want us to have to deal with this all the time and by the way solving the problem does not mean bribing the governments of Guatemala El Salvador and Honduras and Mexico with billions of dollars in aid as some sort of ran some some sort of black male\nYou know there's an okay fine we'll give you a bunch of money to make your country better just you know keep your people where they belong what is that that's not foreign policy\n[noise] All right uh I Will not get the phone number because you're all just dying to jump in here you are already filling up the lines

I I Know you want to talk about this is driving me crazy too I'm just as infuriated about this story as you are you know what actually happens right now\nThese people come to our border\nOr some of them aren't smart enough or they haven't been told to claim asylum those people are processed very quickly and sent back usually right back to Mexico immediately right\nFor the people who have gotten the talking points and they said oh no I have to have enough so I have to have a silence\nAnd then they're given a form and they say okay come back for your hearing day actually majority of them do come in for their hearing they have their hearing and then there are denied asylum but guess what our government does [noise] they aren't then immediately taken from their hearing to a bus and shipped back home now [noise]\nA a had a bit of a thaw in relations with the Mexican government he ended up making a trade deal with them\nOr is there a way diplomatically that that we can't impress upon the Mexican government that this is there a problem and they are going to be held accountable if they don't stop this uh and and get this taken care of before it ever reaches our border\nYeah look they they need this new version of NAFTA or to be ratified yup they need to have America believing in their economic stability they they need Donald Trump\nThan say don't do anything to stop this caravan I think they're going to damage that relationship substantially so yeah I think the tough words from it from the president are needed to that this stop that just can't continue to happen they'll be doing this every couple of months\nYeah I completely agree with you and I think that that Mexico needs to demonstrate to the states of America that they are not a failed state\nThat they that they are capable of controlling a their own borders in their own country and uh otherwise what's the point I mean that that this will continue it will be tens and thousands more uh all the time\nBy the way met one less thing before I shipped onto another topic\nI just want to point out your in laws are actual legitimate political refugees\nBegan here seeking asylum from Fidel Castro's murderous regime but could you please talk about the distinction it's a very important one it's not about people coming here for jobs or or to flee you know gang members of the political asylum in his important tradition and we honor it in a very significant way\nWe do on a significant way and one of the big offshoots of the Cold War was the idea that if you were fleeing communism\nFeeling totalitarianism to the extent that your life what's at stake it in the case of my father in law his life was at stake on you hit the you know you have the ability because we're such a good and tolerate these the people you have the ability to come to America that even even uh\nYou know being able to qualify for that is tough it's not just because you want to make more money and get a better job it just simply doesn't work that way we\nThat was the standard we literally have to take in billions of people\nYeah and in ... and ... when my I promised one last question but now it's really one last question where's the un on this this and this is an international\nIssue and they certainly don't want to set the precedent that thousands of people can cross multiple international borders to claim a illegitimate asylum in the country of they're choosing this this could have huge ramifications for Europe for other countries in Asia that they need to step up\nTo be politically incorrect but I just got to tell you this is a perfect example of why the u._s. sucks [laughter]\nCourse they should be front and center on this but really there was the last people we wants to be involved I Want John Bolton and Mike Pompeo and tear sit Nielsen and the president came to bake a very very clear diplomatic statement that this will not be tolerated once they understand that I'm telling you this will end\nA let's turn to some of the races for the midterms coming up two weeks from tomorrow and are actually quite a few races here in the area a man that I Know that you're paying attention to\nIt seems like three months ago it almost seemed like a no brainer that Democrats were going to pick up a whole bunch of Republican seats in Virginia but have you noticed a a major shift here because I'm sensing and I'm seeing it in the polls as well [laughter]\nYeah even just in Virginia are you going\nTo want to focus on the Virginia is I'm Talking about bras race I'm Talking about women's rights and even calm stocks race which I Know is still a trending toward ... but she seems to have tightened that quite a bit\nI think every state including the commonwealth you have a handful of congressional races that will determine whether or not Republicans or Democrats or in the majority so Virginia if a guy like Dave Brat pulls out his race\nThan there are rich and I believe he will um uh you know Barbara Comstock she's still in the fight she has a chance to win that race if those folks when those races are they close he's not going to be ...\nI'm Barbara Comstock she's still in the fight she has a chance to win that race if those folks when those races are they close he's not going to be speaker it comes down to about twenty twenty five races around the country that are very very close Republican numbers are trending better in\nEighty Ninety percent of those races we've finally caught on fire or people realize what's at stake and I think that that field is narrowing as the days go by and anybody who tells you that the house has already lost the Democrats doesn't know what they're talking about\nNo and in fact I admit I don't know if you've noticed this but the journalists as well as the talking the pundits for the Democrats on cable news they're they're starting to inject a whole lot of cautious language in their in their arguments maybe it's the lesson learned from twenty Thirteen but\nYou know I I we were begging for like ... trickier Dennis ... senator Leslie Marshall my front our friends at Fox to come on and talk about this none of them want to come on today and and my question you know my question was you know I keep hearing you say this is going to be really close why how\nOn earth is enclosed considering how horrible Trump is and how you keep telling us that America Donald Trump\nI think we might pick up seats in the house if it wasn't for all these Republicans who panicked when the numbers looked bleak and they retired because they thought that everyone was going to lose a lot of those members are not looking at the numbers and saying why did I hear jazz it up again there Donald Trump does that forty seven percent\nIn a poll that was released this morning we you and I both know that you've probably been there the whole time\nBut for these folks there there in shock they cannot believe that forty seven percent of their fellow Americans actually think Donald Trump's do their job it's shocking for them\nYeah and they keep using the term blue wave I'm Sorry if it's a razor thin and it's close and you're not sure which way it's going to go it's not a wave of any kind of mad that\nCan't be a blue wave if we pick up ... Senate seats\nThat as well yeah we need to start redefining what blue wave means speaking of the Senate or the you know I haven't said too much about\nUh the Virginia Senate race yet a Tim Kaine obviously a is a juggernaut in Virginia a sadly and Corey Stewart has had some issues with his campaign but I get a sense as well that one's tightening a bit what do you make of that\nI think that's right I think it's a race that I'm not ... has it has not been as focused on but I think that's exactly right I think what Tim Kaine showed us\nA when he ran for vice president is that he's he's a little bit creepy and three and a and I'm not sure he fits the fate of the commonwealth that well and my guess is that race will tightened just like you know go as these tighten before him\nAs you're looking forward to see ... coming up\nUh usually it's it's in the years of a presidential election that C pac is you know really lead and really crazy but I got I got to think the ... coming on the heels of these midterms and basically I I think the Democrats will have already had her were will be about to have their first a ... a debate believe it or not\nFor Iowa on this this upcoming C pac is going to be pretty insane isn't it I I Know I'm looking forward to it\nYou know it's it is a strange cultural phenomenon now where every time you think that well kind of had a day in a way it seems like a you know it's stepped up to the next level I think most I think number one reason for that\nIs just the country it has woken up I Know other people use other phrases for that country has woken up to the problems that we face and I think people outside the beltway outside the swamp realize if they do take their country back\nUh it work out at a bad direction so yeah I agree with you I think look I'm going to love I'm going to get popcorn for the Democratic nomination fight it it's going to be a ... interesting to watch and I think it is only going to motivate conservatives defeat that sport gauge what they see how breathtakingly socialist they've all become\nWhen Beto O'Rourke loses an humiliating fashion to Ted Cruz a in two weeks which he will I have no doubt about it or does he turned out and run for president do you think\nYes he'll take a tent for weight loss or more and turn around and try to become the front runner for president and ah the only thing that uh I don't like about that is that he is you know we moved very far to the left but I've\nGot to kind of enjoy Donald Trump beating and maybe even a bigger market nationwide I I root for the young man\nDude tonight's a it's a nice rally in Houston that had been looking at the images they're doing it at the big uh I think it's the Toyota Center but it's where the the Houston Rockets play the lines outside the arena
