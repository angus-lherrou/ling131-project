these are not hoax devices that information\nPlus the late in fingerprint plus the potential DNA is really all of the news that we've gotten out of this press conference here the rest of it just so you know summarize for you was attorney general Jeff Sessions FBI Director\nChristopher Wray a person for the postal service a person from uh New York police department all pretty much thinking congratulating each other about what a great job they all did working together and they deserve it you know take take a laugh but it's pretty amazing as the president said earlier today needle in a haystack kind of thing\nAnd whenever we hear that we say excuse me we don't have to wait\nWe've got this guy who tried to kill Republican we've got this incident of powdered substances set to elected officials we've got this incident of elected officials or members of the Trump Administration who were bullied and screamed at and harassed and restaurants we raise it in defense of the truth\nWe raise these issues and these incidents\nTo bring perspective in context of the hysterical accusations that the thrust upon us on a daily basis\nAnd yet here we are today finally I didn't think about all of the incidents that we've had up until now you know remember when the tragic shooting in Annapolis at the capital Gazette happened remember how it remember the shooting at YouTube ... name\nYour high profile media event that involved a shooting or any other kind of violent act over the last two years and how many hours did we have to endure speculation that people on cable news saying well you know we don't have any evidence yet\nBut the president's rhetoric is so and then we find out that the capital gives that had nothing to see what the president United States that had to do with a a local beef that this guy had with a reporter at that newspaper\nAnd we found out the YouTube had nothing to do with the president had to do with this one YouTube or we we find out each and every time and then they just reset there's oh okay never mind ... we'll just go out we were still right in our principal and it's only a matter of time\nWe've had to endure this and endure this and do this and now it appears so far it appears based on the facts at hand but now you know they you know you play roulette\nEnough times pretty much you know if you sit there at the felt and keep playing the same number statistically one in thirty eight times you're going to hit your number that's why they only pay you thirty six to one by thirty five to one by the way that's that's called the house edge\nSo you just sit and keep playing you know twenty three red twenty three red twenty three red and odds are\nIf you sit there long enough one in thirty eight times you're going to get your number\nAnd so today it looks as though they hit their number and now from this point forward this is going to be the defining moment if the media has its way and now we have to figure out a way to navigate that and say okay we acknowledge that it appears this guy was nuts\nAnd does that indict an entire political philosophy doesn't indict an entire political movement does it indicted entire political party sadly the answer for one side of this equation is yes [noise]\nAnd so we have to figure out how to navigate through that and not lower ourselves to their level\nOf some of you want to respond here I'll I'll

because he's within the deal Jay he's able to get more information\nOne would think he'd be able to get more information given that he's reporting directly to Jeff Sessions so anything that Jeff Sessions would have access to why we would have to believe he will be able to get to this year we just\nDon't know that for certain but that would seem likely given the only person who's monitoring you bridge Jeff Sessions [noise]\nWe're speaking with James Murdoch he does investigative reporting a ... specifically investigative government reporting over the Washington Times you mentioned in your article that a congressman Jordan would like to have\nA Mr Hoover come and testified before his committee to give Congress and update is that a good idea or is it better at this point to keep the political process out of it you know let him work under the radar let him do his job [noise]\nWell if they want to keep the political process outta that they could always invite him to testify in a closed door hearing uh say they've got to Rod Rosenstein a few times that guy is deputy attorney general that uh\nThat has materialized yet for for multiple reasons but there are options if they want to keep the politics in the public out there that are suffering for before Congress and talk about what is working on\nNow we as a result of inspector general Horowitz is a work we know that Andrew McCabe the former assistant\nOr deputy director I should say the FBI who no longer works there he was fired a he potentially broke the law with regard to leaks in disclosing the information about those leaks to investigators\nAnd also Peter ... who was also some really fired he is a potentially facing investigation is Mr ... handling those investigations as well we don't know\nUh we we we have seen evidence that he is but that doesn't think that is not what we just don't know and that's I think what some of these politicians fighter usual that\nGo back to the mall or pro ... do you typically or what and why it or not seeing that with this with this investigation\nOn right then let let me cut to the chasing 'cause I'm starting to smell a rat here Jeff ... is it is it wrong for me to\nUh suppose that that that that made me what happened here was Jeff Sessions was under a whole lot of pressure to appoint a second council especially after all of the ... page tax\nHad been revealed after we learn the fusion GPS dot CA was used to obtain the fight so Warren after we learned of all of those abuses that have happened in twenty sixteen and rather than succumb to that pressure\nTo appoint a second special counsel he just stepped up and said oh I got a guy working on it he's been working on it for months to let them go he's fine it was this just used as a fig leaf and it's not really a in the intense investigation that we would expect\nThat's what some some Republicans in Congress are starting to wonder if that's why they want to get deeper in front of and to find out what he's working I'm working on last week\nMr George in Mr ... said why aren't you Jeff Sessions asked for an update on the part they adopt any response as of this ... this week uh they call

move on this what's what do you think the plant them credit\nTimeline right now they're waiting for Mr sessions to get back to that as she what kind of response that yet but I suspect that if they're not satisfied with that response or they don't get a response that they will bring history for four or\nFive [noise] All right well thank you for the update Jeff more talk on the uh the Huber investigation out of the Utah district of the U.S attorney's office thank you Jeff\n... that is a little disconcerting actually but we'll say listen I I I don't want to be hypocritical here because for a long time I was saying get this stuff investigated and get someone who is not from DC get someone out of the swamp so what happens on its\nOwn timeline it happens under the radar so that it doesn't get you know bogged down in what ends up you know getting\nThings bogged down in DC you know with the media with the politics with ah the left and the the pressures of the egos are so so maybe that's what's happening maybe that's what's happening I'm like the things I've got some other things to update you on a a first of all I'm a Brian\n... is a a friend in a really good writer over at the ah ... times [noise] uh and we exchanged a lot of information on these investigations and a ... via Twitter and or via email he he makes some very important points here on the Robert Mueller investigation where things stand there\nAnd some of the principals involved a ... here here's here's the biggest takeaway at this point\nOn on the Robert Mueller investigation uh after what a year and a half now Robert Mueller as special prosecutor special counsel with all of the powers that he has with a ...\nA a grand jury at his disposal with the you know unlimited budgeted appears and really no direct accountability at all he he answers to Rod Rosenstein and that's it [noise]\nAnd Rod Rosenstein really doesn't answer daddy one because we know that the president is in some way handcuffed to firing him right now politically hold see what happens after the election but as of right now that sort of the chain of command here [noise]\nI'm\nRobert Mueller was hired for one very specific purpose and that was to investigate and if appropriate prosecute anyone who was involved with Russian meddling\nOf the twenty sixteen election including with someone with the Trump campaign or any American for that matter\nAnd as of now the indictments that he's been able to bring forth of Americans are are of a a General Flynn\nOf George Papadopoulos but are those only relate to giving false information during the investigation they don't actually relate to any sort of misdeeds involving the election or dealing with Russians [noise]\nUm and of course a Paul Manafort and his associates but that really only has to do with things that happened years before the Trump campaign [noise]\nUm all the other indictments that have to do with Russia meddling in the election those are indictments of Russian people Russian entities or Russian companies right\nAnd it those indictments are not directed to any American Idol okay those were all standalone Russian operations\nIn fact Rod Rosenstein said when he announced those indictments there is no allegation and this meant that any American wasn't knowing participant in this illegal activity alright so all of those indictments against the Russians\nYou know the the little box the ... the Twitter farms and all the things that they had a we're not at all connected to any American\nAnd remember we talked about this when those indictments came down\nIt was January ... I remember it was actually the the day of the Parkland, Florida school shooting or the next day for every member right [noise] um we said the ... this is the I think ... in fact I Believe we have Joe diGenova on that day and he said this is the biggest nothing burger you will ever see\nFrom the department of justice these indictments of these Russians because they're never going to come to court there's no way to to have a day in court this is window dressing this is Robert Mueller\nAs saying look at all of these indictments I brought I'm justifying my existence but they're never actually going to be tried and then something happened we were shocked because there was a corporation that was named called Concord management\nThat is Concord management company apparently was associated with one of these Russian oligarchs and they were named in this indictment and they stepped up and they said yeah you know what we're going to defend ourselves and the Mueller team was trying to lay and delay and delay remember this they were begging for continuances in continuing says\nAnd yeah you know what we're going to defend ourselves and the Mueller team was trying to lay and delay and delay remember this they were begging for continuances in continuing says and finally federal judge has no you brought the indictment what do you need it for\nIf you've got evidence to bring an indictment with a grand jury then you're ready to go to trial let's go so they're having the pre trial hearing right now\nAnd they're very close to throw in this thing out it looks like\nBecause as the defense has said this indictment doesn't actually articulate\nAny real crime\nThey're claiming that this Russian company was supposed to have a registered with the Justice Department or the federal elections commission\nAs a a foreign entity looking to lobby the American government right but that law as had has been enforced by the Supreme Court says it to be in violation of that law you

smart guy he's run statewide in West Virginia several times he wants to talk about all these issues that you know obviously are are happening right there in your state\nBut he's acting like he has some participated in what goes on in this town or Mr attorney general I mean he's acting like like the the politics of DC is separated in some way from his job as a U.S senator\nWell you don't want to do that but the problem is that\nHe's been a big part of the problem is a member of Chuck Schumer the leadership to ensure or part of that whole gangs that caused the wild dysfunctional what's
