down man\nAbout you're right ... thank you a brilliant call and and and listen I'm seeing what pretty much everybody is saying here not going to continue with more calls will just want to give you sort of an encompassing overview ... year old you're all ready for this [laughter] I mean as far as you're concerned there this is this is where we are\nThis is where the American political conversation is and will remain\nFor the near in distant future it's depressing it's fine I listen I'll be here\nTo have the conversation with you to lead part of the conversation with you every day here I Love it I Do I really do\nBut it is kind of sad I Wonder what the difference is because I don't think the left has changed at all they they certainly change their tactics in terms of taking to the streets on a regular basis getting in your face everything became a community organizing event you know it wasn't just about an idea that you try to get legislation on and win elections it was it was a you know the the\nConstant marches constant efforts constant\nYou know our conversations everything in our world was a ... in circled within the sphere of of American politics and invaded our our films in the debate it on television evaded are award shows innovated our music and invaded academia and then in a David invaded sports that invaded our football games for God's sake\nAnd so I think that was a a a progression on the left\nAnd there was a percussion on the right to where we started to say hey wait a minute I don't like that we're going to start pushing back on this and it's sort of started with Rush Limbaugh and started with the growth of talk radio and then it it it it morphed into the growth of the Internet and blogs and social media and it culminated with Andrew Breitbart\nWho would then turn and walk into the protests with his camera mock them challenge them show them\nAs the empty ... that they are and it finished with the victory of a presidential election and so now here we are we're both loaded for bear we're both pointed at each other across the the the the battlefield\nAnd no one's blinking no one is blinking at all\nAnd whether it's a debate over net neutrality where people will die in the streets or a tax cut will people will die in the streets or a Supreme Court justice where say it with me people will die in the streets if Republicans have their way on those issues and they'll even go so far\nAs to accuse the man with no evidence and no corroborate should of being a serial gang\nRapist and we're still\nNot backing down any of us so is there an end game here or is this where we are now Dan in southern Maryland beautiful southern Maryland you're on WBAL Dan\nCrafts I listen every day\nI listen to Chris everyday too but this is Larry at this time Dan Larry I'm season you know it happens a lot it's all\nRight um anyway um\nThe problem is you cannot have a civil conversation when there is a person that has no logic\nLogic to their argument and as soon as you start to\nGauge logic to the argument they just get nastier and more efficient and check stuff so you cannot constantly create civility when neither side is really willing to base it [noise] and they are not well\nYou say neither to get better it's going to get worse you say neither side now\nWhen the last two years ago and they're mad now because they lost two days ago that are they going to be when they lose in November\nYeah uh it down well said I just wanted to you know what let me explore something with you 'cause you said neither side wants to be civil but I take issue with that I mean the I think Lindsey Graham is a perfect example of this Lindsey Graham did everything he possibly could be nice and civil to that\nBut I take issue with that I mean the I think Lindsey Graham is a perfect example of this Lindsey Graham did everything he possibly could be nice and civil to the Democrats to the media to the never Trump or his I think he was the never Trump or\nFor a good portion of time there and even he reached a breaking point but we have tried to be civil on\nI I agree wholeheartedly we have attempted\nBut it's there comes that point\nWhen you can no longer keep trying to be several when the person will not air your civility yeah and they just throw it in return and continue to do so and they escalate each time\nAnd that's kinda where we are is no matter what the situation is if it's not bad enough escalate it make it worse\nTo try to win their argument because their argument doesn't have a ... ... to win on that show they escalate argument and make it worse\nThat's make it worse they called him a rapist it wasn't even a sexual assault\nOr they just get up to the point where they were calling him name and I can't think of things that even in the case\nYeah and and then and then as you heard from Hillary Clinton today we're the problem we're now supposed to be gracious and victory we're not supposed to point out the fact that they just to use these this ... tactics and what should have been the most dignified\nEvents that are American government goes through a Senate Judiciary committee a of a confirmation process for Supreme Court justice\nI mean it's not like that happens all the time to it's funny when you think about how many presidents we've had and how many uh elections that we've had a but with a with a body that seats well I guess it started with six justices and has been nine for\nA book the majority of the time of American history and there's only been what a hundred and eight is a Supreme Court justices a hundred and ten Supreme Court just this is not is a relatively rare occurrence\nThis thing that you would think you would think that they would have had some level of civility in that they made it the worst possible spectacle that we've ever witnessed\nIt certainly in my lifetime it was a hell of a lot worse than Clarence Thomas with all due respect to the late justice Bork this was a lot worse than that\nThey put broke through hell but boy they didn't call him a rapist\nAnd now we're being chastised because we had the temerity to apologize to the man that just got falsely accused it's [noise]\nIt makes you wonder whether there is any walking back from where we are right now up hall in upper Marlboro\nPG in the house you're on WMA LA how are you doing I'm good Paul how's it going in upper Marlboro\nEnter busy busy always busy for me I'm trying to say they're making money good that's the American dream I tell you what [noise]\nI think it is where we are but I'm concerned about where the owner said this the family members for the last Fifteen Years I see it going [noise]\nThinking the level of a civil war and and I say that because these guys rational they're violent and you see how how much the violence has increased\nOver the years and it gets to a point where I'm not one just to sit there and and jumping your face and yell and scream at you and become violent but I'm sure as hell not one to back down\nSo now I have a lot of friends who who you know they'll they'll they'll say privately to me you know you know we're heading toward a civil war rights and I assume they're joking around but what is the civil war look like exactly it was pretty clear back in the war between the states where you had states involved full states who had their own militia they put together their own military\nAnd it was kinda nice it was divided almost exactly on the Mason Dixon Line but here this is not geographically separate like that\nWas that well that could be that the the worst in my opinion right it it's not that point it door to door\nWell exactly and I and I said that with a ton of concern I don't I I Wish I just don't see how you can change I mean some of the things that I mean you're looking at people running for their lives\nMany road down to the ground beaten by just insane people\nI I'm I'm looking down and I see these protests and people come in

in the world is that the sea and the best way to treat the best equipment\nThe best dog trained but at the end of the day the will to fight is the most important thing is a war look what happened to us in Vietnam when we last Wilker fighter whoa despite having the state is a superpower\nAnd then I realized that the will to win this is also about protecting the founding principles about republic\nShould be most concerned about right now we're as we're seeing the events transpire on this\nIt's about rediscovering America and its value and why we fight for it absolutely\nIf the

M. A.\nReally anything it's almost exactly in sync on it it is that in keeping with what most Maryland voters won or do you think they want somebody maybe an independent mind who might sort of a to look at things his own way not necessarily the way the party leadership tells them to\nWell I I think Larry that were were were ... you know we're we're changing course right four years ago governor Hogan gets reelected [noise]\nOf course before then Bob Ehrlich was elected so we've proven the pattern of Maryland there's I'm thinking the on the ... the letter right and they're going to be on the order are saying ... who's the best\nPerson here I'm Laurie Hogan will would win re election and I think that that bodes well for a number of race was my own uh Craig wolf is running for attorney general uh we've got you know five states tendencies to pick up so we can sustain a veto in Annapolis\nAnd I think people want balance people are kind of sick and tired of hyper partisanship not accomplishing anything and then these people will just sit around in office for decades and and nothing ever gets done\nAs governor ... go ahead sorry go ahead [noise] don't\nBut that's the bottom getting across the state you know when you know the response that we've gotten back from the from the debate which will also\nBe on a they'd be on C SPAN to it at nine thirty tonight was already on C SPAN a ... thirty today and we're just getting amazing the back of people saying you know you're right about the second amendment you're right about public safety you're right about education where has been card and Ben\nAnd and and quite frankly he's he's he's been apps and\nWell and although he was like I said he was on cable news all week for the last two weeks or jumping on board that Kavanaugh saying it's pretty amazing you know Brett Kavanaugh is actually his constituency is Maryland resident but I mean he was so ready to judge him and uh and throw him under the bus without any sort of\nReal are corroborating evidence has that come up when you talk to voters a ... is the Kevin sings front and Center for them\nBut yeah I mean people are concerned about again the hyper partisanship of the U.S Senate let's let's let's turn back the clock in and check the progress but check the progressive been ... to capitalize name was first put out put out their back in July\nI'm been card and got on a on those MSNBC or something like that saying we're going to use every tool to ... make sure that we defeat Brett Kavanaugh yeah and and the beginning it was about uh you know his uh his record mhm uh it was about\nNo no and beginning is about the federal society right that the federal decided to put out these names\nGroups we can't accept these outside groups right of course he doesn't\nTell the American public that the American bar association shoes every ah the Democratic nominee for for for judge because the presidential ministry ... don't they don't have the manpower to that everybody who's up for a federal judge them so\nThey get there from the American bar association so the Heritage Foundation federal so that was the first thing for him it was about outside groups then it went to his record because his decisions\nAnd then it was about darker for the first to worry wasn't getting any traction anywhere right about he was talking about judge Kavanaugh's decisions though by which was talking about the federal society so they had to shift gears an Avon that Dr Ford\nAllegations and the things that she said what happened that that will be the thing too with the the real the capital nomination\nAnd of course it\nBut it was it was politics as usual do he just didn't matter he throw anything anything anything to the FBI\nReport came out there you saw Carter's shift back to judge cutting off assistance\nYes it was it was amazing how doubled how you know these people can double talk literally at the same time use at three different lives and moving targets and expect the American people not to catch on\nA Tony Campbell we're in our final many here when you're out campaigning when you're doing events when you're going door to door hum as an African American Republican I think that people sometimes don't picture a black man as a Republican when you're in Prince George's County or Baltimore and some of the\nLarger African American communities what kind of response you getting are you are you sort of saying listen well\nWhy not try us you know how good the Democrats been doing for you lately [laughter]\nYeah well a couple of things one um get a good response let's say I'm running for us and people are you know kind of a sense of pride and then when I tell them Republican uh they kind of like\nThey're looking to kind of funny then they'll they'll pick my car All right they'll still read you know why I'm running for US Senate\nThey are like they're looking to kind of funny then they'll fill picked my car All right they'll still read you know why I'm\nRunning for US Senate um so I think we were getting a good response or the governor of ... will probably get twenty five thirty percent of the African American vote you know when he when his reelection bid\nA so I think bodes well for myself\nDoing any rallies with Governor Hogan have you done have you done any events or rallies with Governor Hogan is that ... I think that would be an array of events yeah\nBut you know we we have different campaigns workers across the state you know the three of us will myself and governor and we see each other we wave hiding you know we're on to like them\nAll right well let's and he's got a good lead writer I'd love to see that image of you and lieutenant governor rather bird and the governor up there on the stage with some voters cheering you on because you need that Bush and Tony Campbell we'll talk to you again before election day but keep pounding the pavement good to talk ... ...\nAnd yes please\nCampbell for Marilyn dot com and Campbell like the soup [noise] the number for Merrill is called ... dot com\nThing to do to gamble that Campbell for Marilyn dot com or forty four on WMA uh [noise]\nThe nation's largest getting the network\nBeyond fat free reliability of ... out to eat\nMean whether you're downloading files\nWiping faint ...\nEmail and your ...\nYour business to do on the power goes out\nYou're younger you need the reliability limited time to make the switch to contact me get an amazing deal on science reliable Internet one more ways you can take your big beyond\nStarted with one hundred fifty magazine Internet eighty nine Ninety five for not when you add ... out the fact that one voice signed the hundred dollar saving for years how many hundreds ... six thousand gays contests on fast\nOffering ten twenty two years for a while you were\nClearly termination be applied to come in Texas and these extra subject to change could actually pro backup limited up to six hours\nFor forty five W male trafficking whether every ten minutes first on the five here's ed Rodriguez ... carpet cleaning\nAlready set a slow\nFound on two Seventy all the way through twenty eight and ... of ... going to have a little bit of a delay getting onto the ice Seventy junction in Frederick meanwhile the north bound George Washington parkway isn't doing any better we're still Jim Sollisch one twenty three they crashed\nJust before the beltway split now garage doors ... here's the WMA on weather Channel's forecast hurricane\nMichael could bring some locally heavy rain here in the Washington area Wednesday night into Thursday followed by a push straight into fall weather by friday I by the end of the week barely in the sixties\nAnd I looked down to Seventy one quite warm and humid mostly cloudy partly sunny on Wednesday a high we can to bring another someone's overnight Wednesday and Thursday could be some mostly heavy downpours and then by friday Rowley up in the sixties roller destructive in front of the weather channel on WMA out right now we're looking at\nEighty two degrees nation's capital\nForty seven\nJoined the PGA more ... and the fight against leukemia lung cancer and they use support helps to sell the cutting edge research that will lead to more effective treatments and save more lives losing DJ motel dot org to learn more\nYou should educate yourself on T.
