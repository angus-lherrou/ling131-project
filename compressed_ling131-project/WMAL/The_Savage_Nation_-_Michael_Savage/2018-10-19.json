to be like a McDonalds you know here's your here's the judge make your way you're out you're going to get them out in\nA ... and it's and it's quite extensive this book or you can see it as a textbook but you've written a David almost as a a as a novel actually there in ... you know the kid the gun is the central character of it was an intentional\n[noise] yeah I mean what happened really was I was looking for a book that gave the story of the gun not to someone who was a true believer or maybe even a gun owner\nBut just as a history that was accessible and ah I I couldn't really find one like that so I decided to write it myself I don't want it to tell the story of the people who who built the is gone to the end the amazing engineers behind them and the people who use them and tell the story through them because I think that's more just more interesting for to put the readers\nAnd and I I it's funny you often hear a proponents of the second amendment say of course that a good big gun ownership in America at our birds\nUh had very much to do with keeping the government in check the does the does the contemporary research to the contemporary uh writings at the time reinforce that notion\n[noise] oh I think so I mean it was to to keep the state and checked but it was also it was also a matter of necessity in the sense that people were thousands of miles away from the government in a sense or if not that far pretty far and they have to defend themselves and come up with their own [noise]\nOh you know means of means of farming communities and that's not just to say a Indians who are aggressive but we are talking about French\nOr Spanish or other people who are nearby so initially that drove drove their idea of guns it's a very unique experience or other countries don't have it by the time guns came around there already basically settled into places that were living where as Americans we're still forging their country that's what makes them unique [noise]\nAh so exciting with the ideology behind self defense and you have a the second amendment culture we have now\nI have very little respect for the politicians who claimed that they are just in favor of commonsense gun safety laws and on the face of it it's obvious that they do infringe upon the individual right to self defense or the ownership of firearms\nI there are a small handful of them do David her son who say listen we need to do with Australia did we need to do with candidate as we do need to re look at the second amendment and and reverse this thing what\nWould America could be like if we if we actually did go that route [noise] while\nAmerica would never existed if we had gone that route but uh now that it does exist it would be impossible to go that route even if they tried simply because there were four hundred million weapons out there probably so it's hard to even envision what that ... that counter history looks like I'm\nIn my estimation it looks like a country that's far less free and far less safe for most people um because criminals will always get their hands on weapons now\nObviously we view you know when you make a law you you you don't not do something that helps people be safer simply because criminals break the law but the problem is for at least for people who are against the second amendment is that it's in the constitution so\nThey can ah there is a process you know to to overturning that that amendment if they want but I just don't take America's there yet thankfully\nYou know I ... love to talk about what's what's called the gun culture in America and I remember last year right after the the school shooting in Florida here in Maryland there was a student who was discovered that he brought a hand gun to school he claimed that it was to for self protection [noise]\nUm and I remember the news reports said it was discovered that he had an arsenal went home and the arsenal was two rifles to hand guns a shotgun and a lot of ammunition let me tell you something a half my family\nHas a lot more at home than that and people are surprised to hear that I mean what when I talked to me about the gun culture especially in what's called flyover country and white people people really do like to collect guns they have a heck of a lot in their gun safe at home why is that\nIt's interesting I I grew up in New York and I was not you know going culture was foreign to me growing up and that's what I think for my curiosity initially when I moved out to places like Colorado and met people who owned lots of gun uh [laughter] I was kind of like why do you need to do this and then I went to shoot a gun\nSo and met people who own to block some gun uh [laughter] I was kind of like why do you need to do this and then I went to shoot a gun for the first time when I was in my third early thirties\nAnd boy it was an exhilarating experience and I completely almost immediately understood what\nA you know why people do it why they love doing it and tinkering with guns and and I'm being part of that culture\nAh first of all it's ... it's a uniquely American culture right and it's a it's a hobby of culture as well but it also has an idealistic element to it which is is is a rare maybe you see with our old American cars or something\nBut it it it means freedom to people and so it's exhilarating and it's idealistic and there is a long history behind it or if people\nYou know speak to telling me oh my dad gave me my ... and when I was twelve you know to me that would have been a weird thing um but it seems like it happens every happens every day in America and it's been happening for two three hundred years I'm\nPretty sure my wife's from Oklahoma a beach twelve year old by several years actually on her first got so I think those of us who are are robust supporters of the second amendment it is incumbent upon us to be able to confront a\nLegitimate challenges to guns in our society and confront them in an intelligent and compassionate way and and nothing is more challenging I think than the rest of the school shootings that we've seen\nA and of course I Know that was only like four decades ago when we actually had shark shooting and gun safety classes in our public schools where kids would bring their guns to school so what's different David her son you and and what should our response to this be [noise]\nWell I think that because\nEverything's more part is now in a way and you know ... gun the second amendment that wasn't a partisan issue until very recently probably first became that in the seventies and late sixties when there was a ... you know when there was a huge spike in the crime rate and it sort of defined have the debate is half the people say wait to get all the guns off the street and the other half\nYou know say we have to defend ourselves with weapons so simplifying it so I think that we have to be compassionate about these things we also have to define our terms and we also have to define\nAnd lay off the history for instance that since the early nineties there's been a dramatic drop in homicide and gun homicides and yet a spike in ownership of gotten so\nWe can't just blame guns for what's happening we have to talk about mental health and other issues but what happens is whenever there's a shooting and it's always tragic [noise]\nUh you know at least from my perspective Democrats quickly run to pass legislation that has almost always nothing to do with the event itself it would not have stopped the event just simply to incrementally move forward\nWith a inhibiting the ability of law abiding citizens to own guns so then the debate quickly settles into its usual space and we don't move forward\nIt the book is called first freedom it's by David ... and I remember when the Parkland shooting happened last year we saw all of the marches and the\nThe march for our lives by the kids in the David hog on TV every night and all the voter registration and I was watching as thinking okay that's going to be topic eighth through cue\nFor the midterm elections the Democrats are ramping up to have guns be the big issue and it's hardly talked about it All right now what do you think happened there\n[noise] I don't think I there's a lot of emotion behind that there's a lot of emotion after a shooting many that's understandable but I Can't remember a politician losing an election because he was too you know pro gun it doesn't really happen that way ... there are the districts where people are really\nAnti gun I think already Democrat and in most places are pro gun\nAlready Republican and that's not gonna change very much either I just don't think it's a it's it's on the minds of most people in in the way\nThat they speak about it to pollsters and so forth but I also think that most people probably are not as\nAdamantly pro or anti gun as as as they're made out impose either I think you know wanting to have some sort of regulation to you know when we have many I mean there are tons of\nLaws governing old gun ownership it you know they they realize that the tragedy happened that we can stop every tragedy and we can do the ... you know we can do our best but we have to be vigilant uh in in different ways as well so I don't know I think it's just a complicated issue far far more complicated than politics let's lets us believe\nYeah David ... it sounds like you sort of went through this journey the way I did I wasn't a gun guy I intellectually supported the second amendment from the earliest moment I could think about it it just made perfect sense to be able to defend yourself of course\nUm but but then you went through this process of research in you you sort of became a gun guy so what what surprised you when you started researching really looking and the the history\nOf of American culture and how much intertwined with gun culture what were you surprised that\n... ... as I mentioned before the most surprising thing to me is how intertwined with Congress for so long it was a driving force in the nineteenth century and the way people wrote about it and thought about\nWell as I mentioned before the most surprising thing to me how intertwined with commerce for so long it was a driving force in the nineteenth century and the way people wrote about it and thought about guns is very romanticize an idealistic [noise]\nI'm In a way that's even without even puts today's gotten people go nuts to shame um I was kind of surprised that that um it wasn't until the Nineteen thirties at the ... it was the first time anyone had ever even challenge the notion\nOf gun ownership being First Amendment writer challenged at almost at all and there were some local laws in New York there was a law but\nGenerally it was just assumed people could own guns no one ever challenged it no one had never had to go to the state to ask for permission it wasn't really until the sixties and that may be Nineteen eighty six when fully automatic guns were banned that they were really any regulations\nCould inhibit people from owning anytime they want it um I just assumed they were always some

as a society as a community I mean I just say it because it seems really lame but yeah you're right it's not lame but all bill in fact it's one of the reasons\nWhy I really wanted to talk about it

topic number one on people's minds and that's what we do here every afternoon and let's not forget every single one of you listening but not just the ones who called and every single one of the next five then you're good luck charm\nBut I think Israel is best when the United states is working for our allies to try to isolate Iran and not make or on a looked like the good guys rather than than what they really are\nI see I I appreciate that let let's turn to this hemisphere as we're seeing these images from Guatemala Mexico border we've got thousands and thousands of Salvadorans Hondurans and Guatemalans who are bound and determined to march across Mexico and I get to our border what should we do to stop that should we stop that\nWhen one of the reasons we've had a uh a program to try to improve the living conditions in Central America\nOh it's been supported bipartisan by Democrats or Republicans it's included in President Trump's budget we want to improve the living conditions for those of our neighbors who live in Central America so they don't feel threatened to have to leave their country\nClearly we should deal with this issue before it reaches the border in the United states is in the host country or as the the southern border of Mexico so I support that uh if they have legitimate claims solemn we should listen to those claims\nAre but in many cases it is a situation of trying to improve their their living conditions of their own country\nAnd I want to tell you I appreciate you being consistent on that because this is actually you in twenty fourteen during a hearing about the unaccompanied minors who at that time under the Obama presidency we're starting to board or listen to yourself\nSupplemental budget is dramatic on the number of\nProsecutors is dramatic on the number of uh the personnel on the border on the new facilities to take this dramatic except this not dramatic only making a change in the three\nCountries where the children are coming from why not sign on at least put forward a proposal that would have a consequential impact President Reagan did that for HIV aids why aren't we doing it for in our hemisphere and at\nThe time you were passionately arguing with the Obama administration your party ally about a few billion dollars to help conditions in those three countries how many billions will it take it and do you trust that that money is being well spent by Honduras El Salvador Guatemala\nWell ... the challenges that we're providing funds and three different buckets all one deals with a law enforcement all one deals with good governance and one deals with economic opportunity\nA and then of course we have a ... a drug issue that we have to deal with in those countries so it won't we really want to concentrate on the safety of people who live in the country so I've been to Central America obscene how gangs operate [noise] uh we we really do need to increase dramatically\nOr the ability for law enforcement and Central America and reduced dramatically the impunity rate so to me we need to concentrate on on that issue as well as the economic opportunities ah if for the people in the ... and ... and ... in Central America we have made progress\nUh it it we were able to get funds appropriated including um under President Obama and President Trump\nThis as a matter of which I think enjoy strong bipartisan support so we're making progress I Can't give you an exact dollar amount uh but I Do believe we should continue our commitment here with accountability\nAnd yet here we are again and by the way you're right the crime and the gangs it's horrific down there the problem is that a by much evidence that we've seen\nA lot of those criminal gang members are actually part of the Caribbean and many of the gang members actually crossed the borders and the only company children back in twenty fourteen and they're bringing that violent crime here to Maryland\nSo again I guess I'd come back to the question when they returned border what are we supposed to do\nBut I don't know if I'll agree with you on on that statement I\nI I I've been in bed with the FBI down to Central America I I Know how dangerous the numbers are\nUh I have interviewed a gang member who actually came to the United states has set up sister gangs including in Maryland so I I understand the the danger factor but as it relates to these gang activities I think most of the uh the families that show up in our border or\nPeople who are see themselves as desperate to they're trying to escape Central America in some cases they have a legitimate fear of their lives and should be able to seek asylum\nYou know what let your fairness let's leave the criminal element out of it let's say that every single one of these four thousand people come into our border right now are looking for a better life they're afraid of crime in their country and they're afraid and they want a better economic situation they get to where border what are we supposed to do with them ... it\nThey're afraid of crime in their country and they were afraid uh and they want a better economic situation they get to our border what are we supposed to do with them\nIf they have a legitimate claim for assault that claim should be heard no one should be admitted to our country without proper vetting\nOkay been been hold on I'm Sorry to stop you but wanting a better economic situation and being afraid of a criminal element in your home country are not legitimate\nClaims I agree with you I'm not I don't disagree with you wanting to better economic opportunities dog browse for assault so what do we do with them well ... what we have to do it with a prior to the Trump Administration has returned some of them around we we we either if they're from Mexico they returned to Mexico there from Central America we fly back to Central America\nI'm not a lot of them I mean we we ended up giving us because we do turn because senator carton what happens is they claim asylum and then they have to wait for their hearing and so they get their noticed if their hearing and then they just as they are right about\nThat that's why we should be able to do that is why I'm for dealing with these determinations before they reach our borders so we don't have the problem of someone at our border claiming a solemn that's why right if they're not from Mexico and fewer are claiming a solemn from Mexico it'd be better to have these issues were resolved\nCertainly uh by the time they reach the southern border of Mexico\nI'm asking you based on the reality of the last four years that we have actually seen because we haven't resolved it in a Honduras Guatemala El Salvador they are coming to our border they will claim asylum should we just let them in and say okay we'll see what you're hearing date\nThat we should we should be able to make determinations we should be thought but we do at the border so that we can have timely decisions right\nAll right and so that means what setting up the court systems down there are increasing the number of judges and magistrate so that we can actually I have new here in\nThe Trump Administration has requested that and so the bottom of industry and we provided more\nUh ... the challenges we see a cycle on the on the numbers coming to our border has not been a consistent flow there's been a ... and you are absolutely correct largest number coming to our border\nAre coming in for seasonal work going back there is a it's an economic issue right they don't always come here to stay here so uh ... I don't know the numbers for this year but in the last couple of years is actually more\nGoing out of our country then our country those who are undocumented so it flows at different times since ... we have a very long border with Mexico the circumstances in certain G A geographical areas are different than others it's not a simple situation but you're absolutely correct\nWe need to fix this we don't want to have\nA system where people show up on our border for economic reasons and then come into our country are using that as a reason and then up seeking asylum one there it's not really an assault case\nSenator Ben Cardin we hit two very important issues in a foreign affairs national security I Know that that's what you like to talk about one in the middle eastern ones here in our hemisphere and hope to have you back before election day to talk about some other issues as well but sadly we're at a time\nNow we're talking tip\nThank you so I Do appreciate you joining US Senator Ben Cardin is the incoming sooner in Maryland running for re election just Nineteen days away\nAssociated Rodriguez the traffic\nIs worth sponsored by maximus smart security lines of cars go north sound I Ninety five leaves begin in Laurel right about one Ninety eight heading up to one Seventy five south on ... from ... to twelve down the\nHallway splits in Greenville North on bone marrow washing the Barclay stop and go from NASA Goddard highway one hundred south we got to solve bus that's why you're ... thirty two getting down to powder middle road that buses in the right lane mountain garage door repaired on the WMA mothers handle more rainy\nSet up to begin the weekend then a blast of silly Arab moving in for Sunday Sunday the ... not getting out of the fifties and they will hold that rather cool weather in the early next week but I mostly cloudy skies rain developing mainly Lincoln I mainly overnight lives in the upper fifty\nClearing up as we had through Saturday at least the raindrops out the clouds linger mid sixties windy Sunday colder in the mid fifties warning losing the from the upper thirty ... from the weather channel on W any on right now it's sixty five degrees nation's capital for forty eight\nLeaving ... with the security line mock notifications on our smartphones summons on our dollar even talk live anywhere anytime knocks easier in stone and keeps our families face ... year old ... ...\nIf you're in the market for new or ... own for each please take my advice visit my friends have recalls parkway port in Woodbridge, Virginia I Know so many of you listening right now are are driving right past would rich right you're on an island in court or you're listening up a storm and it's so easy to just pull off there\nAnd check 'em out uh they're they're over on a noble would plaza Thirteen seven Seventy nine to be exact and you can't miss it because\nThey're a show room looks like an airplane hangar it's gigantic they have such a huge selection of cars wary of Ford's uh and and here's the deal you're driving\nShe'll room looks like an airplane hangar it's gigantic they have such a huge selection of cars wary of Ford's uh and and here's the deal you drive on to there are a lot and you check out their selection of beautiful new and pre on Ford's", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "year": "2018", "city": "Washington", "day": "19"}
