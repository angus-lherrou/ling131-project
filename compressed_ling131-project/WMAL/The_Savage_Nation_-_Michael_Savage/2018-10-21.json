great to be here thank you so much for having me\nRight off the bad for us as as a lawyer as as an attorney yeah what were the highlight the highlights and the low points of yesterday's testimonies between the two\nWell I thought the highlight\nWas Brett Kavanaugh's opening statement which was something I didn't think he was who was capable for at least to act for after watching his interview earlier in the week with a more from a column on Fox I thought he was going to be a little bit to get up\nFor this process and yet he gave a about an hour presentation which was moving combative\nRightfully indignant but all in all I think in in probably a pitch perfect measure that a lot of us wondered if he was he was really a up for and I think it actually after the\nTestimony of Dr Ford who who by the end of that testimony or seem very earnest and sincere because if we can get into the partially I think because of how poorly or she was questioned in the in the early in the morning session um\nI think because of how poorly or she was questioned in the uh in the early in the morning session I'm you know I I thought\nReally that Kavanaugh's nomination was on the brink\nOf of going the wrong way 'cause we're obviously talking about an audience of a ... that really matter is probably four or five Republicans who if they you know who were teetering and if they if they go go\nThe wrong way from the Republican perspective Kevin can't be confirmed so I think his opening statement really saved\nHis nomination and yeah and obviously but you know Lindsey Graham's speech was a barn burner and very moving but I don't think it would have mattered as much if Kavanaugh hadn't been so convincing\nThat's right and Brett Kavanaugh really the only person to stick up for himself into Lindsey Graham said something I and I you know Andrew McCarthy I'm really interested and you kind of broached in a moment ago in your thoughts on this question how do you think Rachel Mitchell support the Arizona prosecutor I did yesterday I really\nWe were just earlier this week is discussing about how miserable it has to drive speed cameras\nAnd how we all feel you should at least get a fighting chance when it comes to the speed cameras well you may get worse in the district if mayor Muriel ... has her way\nAccording to a press release from triple a she is pushing for legislation that would raise speeding tickets in the district up to five hundred dollars\nAnd create Fifteen miles per hour speed limits in some part of the city five hundred dollars or do you do not ... they're aiming for the tourists to the ... what they mean for the tourists says I'm going to guess that if you have a five hundred dollar a fine for speeding or depending on you know how many miles above the speed limit you know going\nThey're just not going to pay it because they're in a different see their misery or wherever they happen to be tighter it'd be like screw you Washington DC I'm not paying this and that's exactly what's going to happen\nI forgive Merrill bells or five hundred bucks one of my divorcing her that this this is insane you know what is it supposed to be a traffic fine mhm\nUh it's called the vision zero initiative the proposed changes include increasing the fine for going twenty five miles over the speed limit from the current three hundred dollars to four hundred dollars\nThat would be an freeways and interstates five hundred dollars on city streets now if you're in a twenty five mile an hour speed limit and you're doing fifty miles an hour in a residential area I I agree with that\nI just don't think people should be doing fifty on city streets especially where there's kids and people are living in that\nKind of thing yeah but defined residential area I mean sometimes there's road that don't really have houses next to them and you're moving too quickly and maybe it's an accident or whatever the five hundred bucks yep now\nAnd it would create safe zones 'cause that's what liberals who do safe zones with speed limits of Fifteen miles an hour for roads that are next to school facilities and ground serving use\nAs well as a playground recreational facility a pool and athletic field or a senior center designated by official science\nHave you ever driven Fifteen miles an hour if I can walk faster\nAs like if you need to make sure the car is not on any ended up somebody behind it pushing you that's how you can do it and and they can't always be pushing you because you might go to fast at Fifteen miles an hour ... you would have me on your scooter this\nThat's actually true it does go like Eighteen point six miles per hour yeah people are on bicycles are going to be blowing past you yeah\nD.C has already given out approximately ...
