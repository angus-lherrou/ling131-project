don't do it just in the open road that's why we work hard to create these past facilities\nWe had one or the earliest ones it's called them study it's on the campus of University of Michigan it's thirty some acres then we decided to go ... or ... the American Center for mobility and break test can be run to make sure we can do things safely as we have an open because for things to develop appropriately it's a combination of open road testing\nCause for Saudi testing such as these facilities and then computer simulation and then combining them all to make sure as each step happens before we do it on the open road it's ... and the wreck safe environment so we've worked hard to make that happen a we need to continue on that I see that development work\nAnd as we've seen in the news safety is such an important element and tell us a little bit about the safety research is being done\nSafety researchers at the forefront of this because you're talking motor vehicle that\nCan be dangerous um devices are not down appropriately so that's why it's important that we look at how they have operator controls we have safety features involved with them\nAnd that as we continue testing we create environments where everyone can share their test that because we can learn from one another and hopefully if someone has a problem how can we avoid seeing that happen and hopefully those problems first happened on a closed course environment so we can ever stop them from happening on the open road\nFind out more about mobility technology at planet em dot com that's planet him Don

find when\nWe visited memories congressional report\nFor the Washington Post\nAnd he just day to show up their blamed the Tea Party and\nFor the Giffords shooting back in the sun by a rabid anti\nGeorge W. Bush mostly a political insane person [noise]\nLike I said about the New York times editorial board not reading the New York times because last year in an editorial they blamed they brought up the congressional shooting and blame Sarah Palin for the Giffords shooting in their editorial\nCondemning political violence they couldn't just can damn you know the attempted assassination of a bunch of Republicans they had to say but Republicans did it too and we shouldn't do that even though Republicans didn't actually do it\nAnd they didn't read their own newspaper which had to bump that many many many times\n[noise] apparently pulled Cain doesn't read the Washington Post either and again who could blame him if he did he would have remembered that in June fifteenth of two thousand seven teen they're fact checker ... elite no that's all won a whole different words\nA wrote a piece about the shooting and about the New York times and how they screwed up that blaming Sarah pale and yet again for the Giffords shooting and her piece is entitled the bogus claim that a map of crosshairs by Sarah Palin's pack incited Gabby Giffords' shooting [noise]\nSo it turns out that the editorial board of the New York times doesn't read the New York times and the congressional reporter for the Washington Post doesn't read the Washington Post again you can't blame him\nBut you would think that just almost by us most is this thing having been brought up and do bunk ... so many times that somehow it was this Tea Party are inspired by either just\nIt was just this thing having been brought up and

the show for breakfast stick around ...\nThey either come for money or somebody's funding them but they weren't that big and nobody took them seriously and nobody should have taken them seriously they still shouldn't be taken seriously as people at this point [noise]\nBut ah now they are the Democratic party they are the leaders of the Democratic party there is no Afghan\nAnd the Democratic party anymore it's all French no pillow it's all French we saw that this past week not just with the Kavanaugh mess that they created downtown but out in Portland, Oregon where\nOn a Saturday because of a police shooting out there the antifa and well I Can't even call them ... any more than the brown shirts with the Democratic party\nDecided to go out and blocked major intersections downtown and yell at everybody as they drove past just trying to go about whatever business they were trying to go about yelling at their lives are white supremacy than they're racist\nNow these are a bunch of white kids yelling at white drivers that they're they're white supremacy rate I imagine they some of the elderly drivers were a little bit disturbed by this and hey how ya doing wife standing in the middle the intersection you're a racist oh okay [noise]\nAnd they would try and drive through the crowd and the police stood a safe distance away and making sure that these mutants were not interfered with in any way shape don't ever go to Oregon I don't know why anybody would [noise]\nAh they say it's beautiful you can capture beauty and a photograph just get really close to your computer or TV screen and put pictures of Portland up there and say wow this is pretty I'm Glad I'm not here because some idiot left us with a black mask over their face would be screaming at me about something\nBut this is the face of the left and they are very upset when you point out their shortcomings and the fact that this is a mob as we heard all week you're not allowed to say the N word on CNN for example [noise]\nThat is how the left is when they lose they changed the rules of definition of mob is quite clear just like the definition of marriage was quite clear for all of human history until liberals decided it was no longer politically convenient\nAnd they rather than try to pass legislation to redefine the word or broaden the definition however you want to put it\nThey simply decreed it to be so and now to say anything else is homophobic [noise]\nWhen it come came to gender\nIt was pretty clear for all of human history there were men and there were women just from a biological standpoint they\nGot an any you got an outing and that was pretty easy to figure out it was thought to be obvious start to be universal and now it is thought to be a hate crime to point that out [laughter] to even you know have different bathrooms is now a problem\nThat those words not only does it you know marriage they haven't yet redefined it to a broader point but it's coming trust me somebody's going to sue the way that we've become so tolerant to things that you shouldn't necessarily be tolerant of\nSooner or later there will be a broader definition of that word and fit in some things that right now would make you cringe and you're sitting there in your car and you go to Derrick there's no way anybody of a slippery slope argument that's homophobic to say that look what's happened with gender\nThere were two then there was three\nThen there was forty\nFifty seven in the u._k. they have Seventy two different gender choices on Facebook and these aren't if you've ever been through the list and in my book I put out the list of all the genders on on Facebook in the u._k. [noise]\nIt's not a dimes worth of difference there's different spellings there are abbreviations but they're all in there and they're all important not because some code writer at Facebook thought he'd go crazy\nAnd decided to spell things in a different way or do some abbreviations it's because somebody somewhere\nWith too much time on their hands in ...\nThings in a different way or do some abbreviations it's because somebody somewhere with too much time on their hands in probably a mental disorder\nDecided that trans pan queers sexual ... didn't quite capture them they wanted to be T. P. cute sexual\nWhich is if you're playing the home game just the first initials or that's the sort of difference and that's how you get to Seventy two different genders in the u._k. version of Facebook somebody thought that and somebody else said okay\nWe're now just okay somebody throws if it no no I Want to be called a this sort of that sort of this kind of thing and and instead of looking at this person and just saying no that's ridiculous you're already covered\nThey go okay and they'll just added another one in there now just when it comes to actual gender we're all covered were covered when it's male or female you want to throw in hermaphrodite fine but that's it those that\nFood pyramid that little triangle has every buddy covered every base covered but it comes down\nTo well I don't identify as I Want to be gender flu I wanted to be a pen sexual gender flew in fairy ... is also a vegan and therefore you must pretend that I have wings pretend that I can fly and make a new gender category for me on Facebook\nNot normally people would go sit down and shut up pat I'm On the head give them a sucker and say okay you're a you're not special nobody special\nAnd uh you have to do something existing doesn't make you special you actually have to do something to be special so why don't you sit down and shut up and worry about your homework or worry about whatever you have to do getting up for work in the morning and now it is okay we show part the red sea for you\nWell shall do whatever it takes for you\nAnd now you know it used to be you know the men's room and the ladies' room and then there was a family bathroom now is gender nonspecific bathrooms\nSooner or later somebody's going to be offended that they're weird symbol that they just created\nIs not up on a bathroom door somewhere and suddenly every bathroom door will become like the cover of are Led Zeppelin album where they all have their own little symbols and they're all they're not part of it I'm not the plant ... the leaves over here are too big and they're not droopy and therefore that doesn't represent me I'm going to threatened to sue you\nI just had a second child on friday\nI have a sixteen month old daughter ... two daughters I fear for the world that they're going to inherit that they're going to have to populate because they're going to have to come home to me and their mother every day from school after being marinated in this stuff\nAnd we're going to have spent an inordinate amount of time trying to de program them from this garbage it's not going to be easy I Can't guarantee that I Will not get into a cursing match with some PC millennial teacher somewhere along the line who\nHer job should their job should basically being giving the kids that piece of paper and some ... and trying to get them to draw a straight line but instead they are going to go into the complexities of gender identity and how important it is to make sure that you know which pronoun to use for which person and don't assume anything asks him first\nIt's going to end poorly\nBecause we are taking essentially temper tantrum and making them policy we're we're postponing temper tantrums\nAnd now we're getting high school and college kids having their temper tantrum so they should have gotten out of their system when they were in the toy aisle at target with their parents when they were five or six years old and learn the definition of the word no and then it actually has meaning and it sticks\nBut instead they're getting the toys and they're getting pandered to and then they're being taught in schools about how their victims and everybody's a victim and by the way society is built on racism sexism homophobia this that and the other thing\nEverybody is some sort of ... fold or privilege they'll have the food pyramid of\nOf victimhood status and it's an ever sliding scale [laughter]\nI guess you you can be a victim if you're a white man you really can't be a victim but if you're a trans white man you can be if you're gay trans right man your ear even higher than that\nIf you're of mixed race gay trans man your higher than that and it just goes up from there every police officer is going to have to carry around a slide rule to figure out where you fall in the victims scale were you in fact victimized by somebody's mean words saying that your hair looks bad or your ... looks begging those genes [noise]\nAnd it just makes you want to move out of the country doesn't it [noise] because it's not going to get any better I

Red Sox shoes they call shared yeah they're very cool [noise]\nUm you are normally come in the five o'clock hour we have more fun but we'll be able to actually get your input on here 'cause you've got to go to a soccer game but there are a big soccer game ... soccer match your five year old no nine year old now you're going to be nine year old kid when I ... yeah he sure it doesn't seem right\nUh anyway I Want to talk about not Kanye West\nNot directly Kanye West to find my cut sheet here\nTo talk about ... the reaction to Kanye West I found the catchy cage it perks up she woke up for a second what I asked so little of Asia but uh I I Want to talk about the racist reaction\nTo Kanye West God Forbid a black man like Donald Trump now can't do it and you think well it's Donald Trump he is a special case you know look up what the the left to declare Thomas and has done to Clarence Thomas ... rice or Tim Scott or just about anybody out there they\nThey Savage anybody if you are not willing to fit neatly into the little box at the left makes for you\nBased on your looks your gender your your gender identity or sexual ...\nIf you don't fit into that and don't stay in their pure gay conservative it's game on if you are a if you're a conservative you can make homophobic jokes about that conservative look what Lindsey Graham goes through Chelsea Handler makes jokes about him coming out of the closet all the time\nIf you make even a passing reference to that about somebody who is a liberal it's a hate crime and the mob will come down on you and demand that you can buy you allowed to say that word dark bass ... sure I have to turn the title of my book I I should be getting a royalty every time somebody says the liberal mob\nBut last night on CNN yesterday afternoon actually during Wolf Blitzer show Don Lemon went off on a racist rant and a bunch of audio here because they want you to hear this and each little clip is more ridiculous\nI'm going to have for the bigger the celebrity they are and the younger they became a big celebrity the less interesting\nThey are as people yeah because they're they're not particularly educated and they have lived in a world where every where they are they can afford anything\nAnd there's nobody gonna tell them no and make it stick there just isn't anybody can say last night I was at a book party for my friend Eric Dezenhall he's got a a a great new book out called best of enemies about the last two spies of the Cold War and Robert Deniro was there\nSo I met Bob De Niro why that I got into signed the copy of the book is he's actually a store a cookbook and he played a role in helping free this KGB spy from a gulag\nAnd uh [noise]\nI wouldn't want to have a serious conversation I'd like to get stories about some of the movies you know and maybe some of the crowd he ran with but if I Want to discuss health care if I ever find myself a situation where our health policies I used to do health policy their credit I should\nI Would jump off a bridge in sooner jump off a bridge than have a conversation with Robert De Niro\nIs doing there probably won't be putting you in his next move primary\nWet stuff in the air agents gotta talk\nBut that's that's the sort of mentality Robert Deniro doesn't know what the cost of food is what the cost of milk is you know if you talk about\nIt is it's really tough right now I gotta go wrong clipping coupons Robert De Niro isn't going to know what the hell you're talking about because he has lived in that world since she was Eighteen maybe if he ever did I don't know his back story\nSo Kanye West has been famous in rich since he was probably a teenager yeah very successful in music\nIf somebody goes down as I sold ... earlier in a different context somebody goes down from a stab wound\nUp going to go ... do something to kind of a isn't going to know what to do I would like to eat if we can put some pressure on is that a minimum but it is not somebody you'd call in a pinch unless the pinch was I Need five million dollar right away then maybe he'd help you but\nHe's just not that type of person so I'm not I don't care what ... said he's ... he's always been this way they're just paying attention now because they don't like what he said he wasn't exactly coherent when he's into that bit by bit of George W. Bush doesn't care about black\nPeople right but if when you listen to him talk he makes a lot of really interesting points it makes you think I mean he does go on to talk about something right away it's just the way he his mind operates but he actually says I'm very extraordinary things and I think people denigrate him because you know he's just but\nThey don't like he thinks out loud they don't like what he says right he does and you can when your music and writing and being creative as as a brainstorming session new bounce ideas off of people and that's kind of how he sounds like he's talking is not going to be eating paste and sitting in the corner banging his head against the wall anytime soon but Don Lemon\nDoesn't like what Kanye West to saying so we go back to the Don lemon\nAudio why are you sending cameras to the oval office Kanye West and just in cameras to the oval office and carry it live when common visit the White House come and visit the White House and then they beautiful poem spoken word talked about black people or kings and queens how we need to rise up and do better his\nParents anybody spanking non secular can't do anything awful\nAnd I tell you some kind of song I don't know who come and do\nSo you would if you saw him he does a commercial right now for something I forget what but he's an actor\nToo and I think most people whose common that they are not really sure kind of hurt him who's ... everybody's kind of come and everybody knows Kanye West right but a more well a lot of people know common anyway\nIn common some of his songs\nPretty racy pretty offensive if you're not into that\nThat ... Don Lemon loves it 'cause it's his spoken word poem said that he was a king and queen okay here's newsflash Korea done\nThere nobody's all king and queen ... if you can't have a kingdom of all kings and queens doesn't work that way that that's an ego boast its garbage it's P. R. and spin that you've been fed is since a child since childhood to inflate you're already in the flight attendants and other point\nMaybe um when I I just think about you know bronco bomb and not the most exciting guy in the world com and reading poetry I Can't imagine that was great TV no but watching comedy away just renting or even the White House pretty awesome I mean that that's almost performance art it's just like watching Don Lemon rant and rave\nThe only people who criticize somebody only people who really covered it where Sean Hannity and his band of hypocrites now or now applauding Kanye West in the same people that many in that group called the N word because of Taylor Swift and because of George Bush\nIs gonna cry does need out there is no uh no instances whatsoever of somebody going on Fox News after Kanye West say that about George W. Bush or came up and took the Mike from Taylor Swift and said can you believe that and we're\nWhatsoever of somebody going on Fox News after Kanye West say that about George W. Bush came up and took the Mike from Taylor Swift\nAnd said can you believe that n word [noise] there's none of that whatsoever I don't remember Donald limited and I don't know what happened to John lemons green rooms and I'm not privy again to the early all staff email they sent all black people\nTo listen to Kanye West in the oval office yesterday with a little bit more ah but Don Lemon and then we got Michael Eric Dyson all the ah MSNBC resident racist\nNobody can go any lower than you do oh yeah my Michael Eric Dyson said nobody ... my beer in hand me that we'll be right back\nWashington Mall W and a hell of Washington comes to talking\nBig meal is addiction dentistry started over a decade ago because I wanted to be able to provide dental care to those individuals who had a fear associated with previous dental experiences I Am Dr Alex McMillan and we interact with these individuals a little differently was much more of a T.
