book you lay out than it is only for a well regulated militia the ownership private fire elective right absolutely ...\nUh but uh your article it doesn't really make too much of an mentioned on the media and their participation\nIn the events that transpired over the last two weeks but I I Know you well enough when you're writing well enough to know that you've got an opinion on that I feel like this was a turning point for the media is well if we if they hadn't already shown there and they became such active participants in repeating every single unfounded allegation that came out against Brett Kavanaugh\nYeah absolutely I think it was a big moment it's hard to tell these days because there are so many big moment in all the time big moments but this one I think for many moderate Republicans Republicans who aren't crazy about the Trump it was just a moment where they saw that the media was you know was an activist\nGail part of the DNC and and that or maybe not everyone but more than they probably even thought and uh\nIt's corrupt I mean it that way we don't have a media that's giving us the facts and the way that they should everything is colored um towards the left and we just have to deal with that fact and accept that fact completely I think and and this event more than any that I can think of a sort of reveal that to to people I think\n... years some head of this article today liberals inability distinguish between process and partisanship undermines the constitution and we've seen this play out in the last twenty four hours when very prominent voices in the media and with the Democratic party\nHave openly called for not only repealing the uh the electoral college system which they always do whenever they they can't win it um but ... now and wanting to reexamine the constitutional provision that awards two senators per state for that house of Congress are they serious about that\n[noise] you know I think they are there's been a long and you know and

especially when it works for them after the after the Supreme Court has given them what they want it\nAnd the Senate is specifically anti majorities hair and that's the purpose of its existence if you don't believe in those things that you don't really believe in the constitution [noise]\nUm you don't believe in separation of powers checks on power\nAnd I have to you know I think we're not that far maybe a few years away from a debate where we have you know have one major party arguing against the constitution itself and that's what scares me\nYeah a ... and and I mean listen I'm hardly a story on these things but I'm I happened to be reading the turnout biography of George Washington and I just got past the\nThe constitutional convention portion and it it was the slave states who believe that that we shouldn't have to stay at two senators per state\nIt was the slave states who wanted ... rule the abolition is they're the ones who said wait a minute our states need our own level of representation as well they were the ones who have this was the compromise that came up with ... ... does an Alexandria Ocasio Cortez realized that she's siding with the slave owners when she takes us position\nThe opposite and to get me\nWrong I think I'm not a historian really myself but I Would say that Virginia for instance had a huge population nights at Delaware did not and it was a it was a compromise and the other direction and I think that because of flavor anything that it was a very wise compromise and I like the electoral college quite a bit\n[noise] but I think most Americans I Hope will understand or be taught civics at some point it's quite understand why that exists\nYeah uh yeah I ... it was and in fact George Washington felt that he was by by by being the president of the constitution convention he really didn't say too much and he felt he was betraying his Virginia delegation by not speaking out against that because the Virginians we're going nuts\nBut that was that was the only they had to come up with that so they could to actually form our nation and I'm Glad they did a David ... thanks for joining us on these are remarkable times my bread definitely the way are\nWell I Hope the book is doing while I Know it just came out so we'll look forward to having you back in the next week or so to talk about that it's very important topic for eight I appreciate that David again senior editor at the federal is and his book is first freedom or ride through America's during history with the gun\nYeah a little bit more on on this whole idea of overturning two senators per state uh overturned I loved it suddenly they want to have a convention of the states now this is this is a beautiful thing maybe the maybe this will get a circuit mentioned to the states\nIt's quite possible um I've got a better idea though I'll listen I Do think that we saw some fundamental problems in our system over the weekend over the last couple of weeks it did have to do with the United States Senate I'm very happy with two senators per state I'm very happy with the electoral college for that matter but there is a change to the constitution\nIn this regard that I Would humbly suggest whether we do it through the regular constitutional amendment process that we have always employed or whether it is part of a convention of the state's I'll I'll tell you that in
