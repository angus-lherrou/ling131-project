then we saw something fascinating happened yesterday [noise]\nAnd and I love for you to jump in on this is well why do you think suddenly CNN and the Washington Post both coordinated yesterday in the

against us disrupting peaceful restaurants clawing at the door of the Supreme Court and screaming because they didn't get their way we're not allowed to call them a mob\nAnd it's fascinating that in the same day CNN in two different high profile segments had their host pushback on this in a very aggressive way and at the same time the Washington Post\nAnd yelling at CNN and he thinks that's equivalent\nTo disrupting Senate proceedings clawing at the Supreme Court door shutting down traffic\nBarge it into a peaceful restaurant screaming at people trying to enjoy themselves showing up at someone's front door with a megaphone\nBecause they they are they're conservative and work in the Trump Administration that's all the same as Don Lemon of journalists getting heckled by a crowd of peaceful protesters and the Tea Party\n[noise] so where is all this coming from\nWhy is this vociferous push back on the word mob happening in a coordinated way between CNN and the Washington Post who wrote a a column yesterday about this about the weaponization of the word mop uh they're all they're all following the same script why [noise]\n... plane it has a lot to do with something Donald Trump

we going to have a conversation you called in and you wanted to have stability in interrupting someone is not civil\nRight now so that's what the president said uh I don't know whether I Believe it or not listen I think the president is like any other politician and that means they say what they need to say\nTo get through any basic Newsday All right he may have known the guy had a disability he may not have known the guy had a disability what's remarkable to me is that this thing has become such a\nA a huge story for so many people that they latched onto that two and a half years later they point back to it and say see that's where everything started when he stands up at a rally\nAnd and makes fun of a man and you think he's making fun of him because he has a disability let me ask you something he was doing that in front of Fifteen thousand people to rally do you think the people at the rally knew that the guy had cerebral palsy\nI Believe they they really created that candidate for this weight it was a ... motion if I remember correctly\nAnd my question is do you think that people everyone rally Larry New into the reporter dinner with me if I hear what I'm asking you to

important part of this is this\nI can look at President Trump and see the policies that he promotes I can look at President Trump and see the good things that he's done for this country I can look at
