departments\nCourse we I mean we we work with\nThe you know the president no matter who he or she may be we worked with a pro Obama just like we're working with a President Trump now it's just silly

I can tell you that I got to share this very real whenever I see all these\n... and all the headlines and all these stories about the suspicious packages I so help me and my brain can only go to one story one thought one memory remember when we had the controversy over the ground zero mosque because they were going to build a mosque there like in the shadow was ground zero like a block away or something like\nThat and we protesting it trying to keep it from happening and I remember Greg got killed at the time I I think I was on with them on ... years old she'll read either Greg ... felt bad you know we're going about this all wrong\nOr let them build a mosque but what we need to do is right across the street we got to open a gay bar\nAnd I've already got the perfect name for it suspicious packages\nCNN colon Trump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber [noise] now there's a couple of things that are just delightful about this\nFirst this is on CNN so CNN is basically quoting themselves in the tire on with their CNN colon so on CNN they are putting a graphic up to let the viewers know that CNN the network there watching\nIs saying and thinking of certain things so hey you person watching CNN here's what CNN thinks well I don't know maybe it's me but instead of putting it up as a ... run headline perhaps a you've got you know audio visual ability maybe you should just tell us what you think [noise] so the CNN tyrants says CNN\nTrump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber center right there\nThere are again I'm not\nIn the same kind of journalism game that the people at CNN are ... I by the way will absolutely embraced the idea that I Am a certain kind of journalist I broadcast I deliver information\nRight [noise] uh and I also deliver opinion\nJust because you deliver opinion doesn't mean you're a journalist you're not a journalist [noise] uh there are there is such a thing as an opinion journalist there's such a thing as an advocate journalist I Would call James O'Keefe an advocate journalist is a journalist but he also has an agenda that's okay too there's a whole lot of different kind of journalists in Robert Novak was a great journalist\nHe also delivered his opinion with his journalism right nothing wrong with that aren't so ah but but I also let you know what my position is just like Robert Novak they're just like did James O'Keefe does I let you know where I stand I even give you the chance to tell me I'm wrong and full of it by calling in and telling me so it AAA six thirty there'll be a male\nSo I was all fully concedes that I Do a different kind of journalism\nThan CNN claims to do right CNN claims to call balls and strikes they claim to be right down the middle they claimed to be impartial they claimed to not have an agenda they claim not to be advocates so let's dissect this sentence again\nTrump has no plans to claim any personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber so now if that CNN headline\nThen that means CNN is ah has reached a conclusion\n[noise] or if it is news that Trump has no plans to claim responsibility for inciting serial bomber CNN is a inferring that Trump does in fact\nHave personal responsibility for inciting serial bomber in fact CNN is implying\nI'm not just inferring that they're implying it with their own words if not stating it outright that the serial bomber was in fact incited by Donald Trump right that's exactly what they're saying here and that Trump\nApparently\nNeeds to claim personal responsibility at this time he has no plans so\nNow my question to CNN from my journalistic perspective see because listen they're stating an opinion here I think they're they're they're taking a stand and they're they're ... they're making\nA definitive statement of position on this story that they are covering which is something that I Will do\nOn a regular basis but then I back it up with the facts at hand\nSo CNN where the facts to support that where the facts to support that the serial bomber wasn't cited by Trump and that Trump has some responsibility because every single fact that you can show me that we know of about this story\nMay support that thesis but those same facts will support the thesis that this is a a a a a a plot to make it look like a Trump was inciting a bummer every single fact that you late for us to suggest that this was a\nIt looked like a Trump was inciting a bummer every single fact\nThat you late for us to suggest that this was a right now could be a right wing or it could be something crazy Trump guy he could be we're in a magazine that when he was delivering these things but we don't know that CNN doesn't know that they're leaping to that conclusion and they could be very wrong\nFascinating isn't it [noise] but that CNN's late is do we call this guy a bomber if these devices never actually explode\n[noise] do we call this guy a bomber and a political terrorists without actually knowing fully what his a motive is it is remarkable to me that when we hear of a guy named a rough keyed Mohammed Kaboom [noise]\nAnd he blows himself up taking out as many people as you can on a city street wealth screaming allahu Akbar\nAnd the media immediately jumps in front of a camera and says well we can't be sure what the motive is here [noise] we don't want to jump to any conclusions here\nYou know we're gonna we may never know we may never know what the true motive was four rocky Mohammed Kaboom [noise] to to to act as a suicide bomber wealth screaming God is great she screamed God is great you know [noise]\nAnd killing as many innocent civilians in a western city as possible really screen God is great well on translating it for you\nWhat are the actual the actual words ... bar a lock bar you know a bar but we don't know what the motive was we'll never know we'll never know but we do know definitively\nThat this a serial bombers they're calling him mass attempted assassination they're saying even though there's no evidence that any of these devices would've ever exploded as designed\nA was inspired and he was a incited by Trump that we know that we can jump to the ... in fact will go so far as to not only make that claim but we will demanded an apology from President Trump\nAnd that's the state of journalism on this story right now\n[noise] something else and MIT [laughter] how about John and Maryland John you are on WMA a\nThanks Larry you're back you're like oh what a\nLot of areas not terrorists of chaos because if you if we got an upcoming election [noise] I mean the Chinese that Russia's meddling\nIn the Democratic party who may be looking for a little sympathy now a politician running and various other across the country are fair shot well Bush now that are done and maybe they won't have much effect on the march on the border\nWell John listen I appreciate the call only because it illustrates that all of the facts at hand that support CNN's conclusion that they've drawn could also support John from Maryland's conclusion that he's drawn in fact he\nDoesn't you know I I was actually walking down the road with them hand in hand until they've been said that that this was the dmc see I don't think the DNC a smart enough or bold enough to plot something like that because you don't need you don't need to be\nAny organized political party to put a plan out there to sort of inspired or or slime conservatives or an ... you can be one crazy dude on the right or you could be one crazy dude on the left doing this\nYou don't even have to go so far as to say that this was all planned by a non government organizations funded by George ... at the highest levels of the ... you can just say some guy just like just like some guy decided to pick up a gun\nAnd attempt to assassinate as many Republicans as he possibly could leaving them in pools of blood and the baseball diamond in northern Virginia\nJust one guy did that he didn't need to get a phone call from the dmc he didn't get funding from George Soros just one guy decided to do that well one guy could have easily decided to do this\nTo to create a media blitz krieg narrative\nThat Trump inspires Mad Men to send out bombs that I'm not saying that that's the case at all I'm saying that CNN has no right to challenge to the conclusion that is absolutely a of a mega bomber that Trump needs to apologize for I got an idea\nHow about we all sit around and wait for the facts to come in by the way I'm Still sitting here waiting for the facts to come in about the Las Vegas mass shooting\nRight\nYear and a half later I still don't have the answers to that why do we have to jump to the conclusion on this\nWhat we know why we know why Lucien suit lend your next step on WBAL Hi Lucy [noise]\nYou know we're in front of

pretty good and a lot of the Senate race there's a lot of the Senate races will tell you about it also one of those Senate races right in our backyard attorney general Patrick Morrisey as a Republican candidate in West Virginia run against Joe Manchin\nHe's going to be our guest is thirty minutes also we found is that a General Mattis a Secretary Mattis I should say\nHas mobilized some troops sent him to the border what will they be doing is is actually a military effort is it a [noise] a humanitarian effort and what about a touchy homicide and if I mean it's a long time that a little while to go outside of our to talk to attend a colonel thirty safer\nAbout those questions and more coming up and find out right now and it turned our side factor the caravan for a couple of reasons the first is because the media is no longer talking about the care\nI mean I noticed that have you noticed that\nThey're not talking about it they're talking about this other thing I Wonder why you know is it possible that all those are good poll numbers that I just alluded to that we're seeing in a lot of these Senate races for the Republicans are directly related to the fact that we have thousands of people heading toward our border demanding entry and that not a good look\nFor the for the Democrats so whacked quite ... subject but immediately said the subject let's get back to the\nHorrible behavior of anyone who likes to president I'm and I'm just saying I'm not saying I'm just saying\nOh well I Want to keep talking about it because I think that it's a pretty major story especially given the fact I I don't know how many ... I've had two candidates on who are not Republicans so far are we had the independent candidate for Senate that Neil Simon\n[noise] in Maryland and we also had the incumbent Senator Ben Cardin Democrat in Maryland and then I Want to remind you that anytime you have to understand something anytime we have a Republican candidate on for any of these office just had a lieutenant governor\nOr read it for Don right we want the Democrats come onto that it serves nobody here to only hear one side\nBy really doesn't it doesn't hurt anybody and by the way there's you know a standard practices with regard to uphold a bribe someone who broadcasts of cross the airways public airwaves like we are a demand a certain level of equal time\nFrom a candidate a now they're they can't bring on you know they're not entitled to bring somebody on\nThe opposite me and my equal time you are equal time I let you come in and\nTalk to me if you want if you disagree that set so we're we're dying to have Tim Kaine on were dying to have you know uh\nUh all the Democrats would love to have him on Web Ben Jealous good God I Would love to have that Joe is on this program [noise] um but I asked both\nNeil Simon the independent candidate for Senate and been courting the Democrat presented or what should be done with these this dozens of people who are coming up the border what should we do\nWell you know we need a comprehensive immigration approach needs to be comprehensive that's what it needs to be comprehensive okay not really this is not about immigration actually they're not immigration hang a and and this doesn't require a comprehensive not comprehensive at all you know when they said comprehensive I said this before what it means is\nConvenient parking fortunately you can reserve the closest to talk to your destination in advance what spot here\nWhether you're catching the game including the district shopping in Georgetown or just sitting down for some fun spot here are always there for you\nSimply download the spot here a weapon type in your destination spot here and we'll show you the closest parking spots in prices you can even get ten dollars off your first firefight using ... something yeah that's ten dollars off with promote code fast spot hero park smartest\nStories that have been breaking well you've been reporting\nThat we're seeing from media journalists on this so called caravan is outrageous it starts with even falling into care and then by the way you're going to lose them overboard just decided hey everyone we're going to call it a caravan and everyone just all of\nAlso those journalist down there who were interviewing all the horrible cases of poverty and desperation they never turn around and talk to the people were in those brand new green vests the organizers say hey I had a\nBest [noise] who's organizing the source of money coming from how does how some people just spontaneously to gather\nMutually decide to leave everything and walk Nineteen hundred miles across multiple international borders to break American immigration law\n... and they're not asking that question I Know journalism is bad\nWhen when your normal American screens that question at the television and the reporters never ask it it's the obvious question\nHow did this begin and who's paying for it in organizing it and they're still not asking and they're still they're ignoring a major part of this story uh it's it's terrible the way the journalists have covered this uh what do we call these people you know the Caribbean thing it's a very passive now this is not a noun what we're watching we're watching an action\nWe're watching a verb happen cat and ... this\nYear I'm WMA now\nI ... I was thinking or something like international Trump passer\nThat's good that's good it's not quite as inflammatory is invader but it absolutely just try to tell you just reminded me thinking about the you know we keep hearing well you know these people they are not criminals they're not breaking any laws ... every one of them is is break has already broken\nMexico's a border wall right now\nYeah and any other country that they have\nAny other country they pass through I mean the Guatemalans I guess so they they only a past into Mexico but but every single one of them has broken Mexican law right now they're all criminals at this point Ted thank you for that uh what about uh Dan in Harpers Ferry Dan you're on WMA out\nHey thanks for taking my call one that I think this is a covert movement against the United states of America in order to strip away our national sovereignty [noise]\nYeah listen they they're not here yet but when they get here that's exactly what it's going to be stay on a and that's and that's what it's been every time we've seen these escapades\nThese these bizarre little that's done I live one day and drops them I really do that short with everyone when they call them that they just assume they got there one thing and then there's not going to be anything else should work on that\nThey might actually saying all this out loud or is this is my honor monologue data logging county ...\nThanks for taking the call yeah number one it is an invasion of flat out invasion in the news media can go down there and and ask them questions like you said perfectly\nQuote on the front page who's paying for this county American people how much it costs to help this country if they enter the country it's been stated twenty days though that go they disappear into the work\nAnd they know what the\nAbsolutely crazy bunch of Americans tried in Canada that way you think what would they do to us they would shoot us\nFor Canada what about Mexico well nobody wants to go to Mexico you know\nYou try and invade Jamaica trying invade an island somewhere else and they're going to throw you out they're not going to let you in and I think what needs to happen as far as we need to close their embassies in DC they turned him around probably close the embassy here out\nCut off the funding like Trump is threatened we can't let them across the border man not all costs thank\nYou Ted while we're talking to join in shape for about that coming up at five o'clock as the military to peers is going to be deployed to the border what will the rules of engagement be by the way tens of thousands of people invade Jamaica I think it's called the first stop on the cruise\nI I think they call it a a time share selling opportunity that that ... ... timeshare dime on Tom Fredericksburg go ahead Tom you're on W male\nOh look at it this is more like an organized\nProtests going to go sour so that had been more I mean it didn't really stick to the phones are really really hurting they wouldn't be carrying their countries' flags a ton of them live that wants to down the street and also what I've seen on the news and then everything else was that these people will say it doesn't look like they're starving or anything else\nIt's ... the walking down the street and also what I've seen on the news and then everything else is that these people are starving or anything else the Lincoln financial is alive and into\nSomebody's with cooking on the water and given the water in lewd and rest episode to get on with her it's good to be eating a\nLogistically bit kind of thing doesn't happen without planning\nMore thought organization and organizing is a big important word to throw up their time that's why I went to you because they thought this is it I've been doing this sort of big didn't happen before we had a community organizer and the White House and that would be common may I say\nThe new normal we are seeing community organizing now on an international level ... time we'd be community organizing America and we need to perjure yourself\nFrom that because it's not normal memory of garnering the WTO\nWashington's mom W.

know in most\nTypically when you get into civil actions like this\nUm you know that that say you know there's pros and cons of air ... of everything yeah what the difference here is you know I've been through you know probably a total of forty plus hours of\nUh getting grilled by Congress and also you know\nBut by Congress and the executive branch let's just put it that way you know starting as a\nAs the Washington Post you know lead a a ten plus hours with the FBI they've been through everything and you know again you think about it literally a year a four Ninety Days in terms of Pfizer war\nRight where it's round the clock surveillance going through all of your uh all of your documents right there and you know the OJ and the FBI going\nIn other words you've got nothing to hide it there's there's nothing they can discover on you that the Justice Department hasn't been trying to discover on you know with the full weight of the federal government absolutely yet and yet and so now what are you interested in but I don't want to get into your strategy it'd be dumb comfortable with answering anything please don't but\nUh you are going to ask for some significant discovery on the dmc and also on this law firms who has ties to the Clinton campaign yeah\nYeah well you know and this actually ties in with some of the advantages are right now Larry\nBecause again a lot a lot of press coverage has already been completed a in terms of what the house and Senate committees have been in uncovering in terms of all of the uh wrongdoing by the DNC and their and their allies who are in terms of this a\nSize of youth and related prophecies again largely spawn divide this a false report that they were a working to distribute and we're at the very center of so and again there's been a lot of great reports over this about this over recent weeks\nAnd months and that was going on in years so I think the truth is is already starting to come to light so I'm hoping people will be pretty cooperative\nWe're speaking to Carter Page ... of course was the target of the uh the Clinton campaign dirty tricks that ended up\nRemarkably as a a fight the surveillance warrants on him that went on for for quite some time under James Comey and then a Rod Rosenstein can you tell us what kind of damage it you're going to be claiming obviously you have to say how you were damaged by this I I have a hunch but I'd love to hear from you\nWell I mean that is actually they took control of my life you know\nSo and I've had a lot of um you know I had a lot going on until this all started in September of twenty sixteen and you know that really was a a major a derailment of everything I was working on so it's a suffice to say Larry it's it's quite extensive\nHave you been able to get any work you you were an energy consultant and work with international businesses have you been able to you and your profession during this deal\nWell you know there was a lot of um you know I had a lot of relationship for the banks I had a lot of uh projects I was working on and you know potential new projects and you know you can imagine imagine if\nYou are looking to hire a banker or to hire a law firm or someone you know some professional to work for you\nAnd all of a sudden they're these media reports that\nUh you're under investigation for some of the most heinous crime\nThat you're the you're an agent if he'd he'd ever fearing that the uh twenty sixteen election you can you imagine well and and the students who are investor or you know company or potential partner how how they would react to that\nI Would think I was in ... they they said you're a student of the pudding government and these are corrupt or the mobster oligarchy 'cause I don't know if I Would extend any kind of investment opportunities are way under that either ... or ... have you named a dollar amounts in damages\nNow it's a you know dependent there's going to be a lot a long process here so we'll see how uh how things shake out\nCan I ask you why you chose not to sue fusion GPS uh the the firm that was eventually hired by the DNC and this law firms to actually create the the dusty a\nWell I just really gets to the heart of a who was fundamentally are responsible for this so [laughter] you know I um there's a lot of others that are are going that route you know this is a this is really cutting the corps in terms of who was a who is behind it all from\nHulu actually you know you you you you go after the people who actually made the trend another would have happened if the DNC and the lawyers for the Clinton campaign hadn't picked up the phone and said hey Glenn Simpson we got a job for you a written speaking upland Simpson I Would love your reaction\nThe DNC and the lawyers for the Clinton campaign hadn't picked up the phone and said hey Glenn Simpson we got a job for you over in speaking upland Simpson I Would love your reaction to the news we learn today when ...\nWhen a testifying before Congress no use that for how many hours without leading the answer every question many throughout you nine hours twelve hours\nWell you know the the only time I was in a yeah I Know it's a when you add up all of my various congressional testimony is it's probably closer to twenty hours a nun to mention you know there's another element to that which is completely redundant right because they ask you for\nTons of documents right CSPAN going through thousands and thousands of documents [laughter]\nI'm going through that a similar him you know all aspects of your life and you know my point to them was well they've already gone through All right you know it's a given this fake um Pfizer were\nSaying they were just so they they were able to see everything anyway but you never you never ... did you ever think about pleading the fifth would have been easier\nI I was I was negotiating with them you know at the very beginning when I first uh you know when I was talking with house intelligence committee I said listen I have a four year requests and our privacy act request\nWith the U.S department of justice FBI national security agency right\nI you know I Want those documents related to this uh this information which basically overlaps with everything you're looking for right I mean you talk about a perjury trap Larry this is the greatest perjury trap of all time\n'cause you you know these are people that have literally every document that you've ever a you know that you've you've had over the last year and you know they're asking you well you do the same work I mean it just on the face of it makes the zero\nSaying yeah you you are not for us for\nThat and there's there's no basis for a you know what they did and so show me the documents and I you know that I'll answer your question\nBut you did justify and you have not been charged with perjury in fact you haven't been charged with a with anything bill to this day I Would love your reaction ... what you make it with the fact that you the guy they said was the agents of the Russian government who was trying to help overthrow the election\nYou answered every question under oath Glenn since then he's just the guy who you know do the job of uncovering all these horrible things in creating the da da da\nDing ... Lee Larry is they've just been trying to you know cover up for what [noise] what happened right and I think you know step by step or if it's only damaging them right because\nUm the longer this goes on you know sooner or later it's going to be out in the public you know it's um\nIt's unfortunate because it's doing a lot of damage to our country on on many levels I agree you know again that's that's part of the whole motivation to begin with right they wanna do damage so I mean that's the whole point of and operate opposition research a project to begin with\nUm I Know you have to run in my last question for you Carter Page listen this is a deep pocketed law firm and they're a D.C law firm uh they they work in politics\nI bet they want us to go away or if they offer you a settlement will you take it or were you bound and determined to have this all come to light and have your day in court\nI Would I Would really like to have my day in court Larry but again I'm I'm open minded and I'm always uh you know we'll have to see what happens you know what I was well it's interesting in my uh other case uh the with\nUh the you know the original publishers in terms of the media outlets both the U.S government propaganda agency funded by the broadcasting board of governors\nAs well as the the oath which is the owner of Yahoo News and horizon I'm Sorry I'm a Huffington Post\nThey take those the lawyers for the private companies they were literally very um they've actually been much more open and yeah\nA cooperative in terms of you know some of the the ... and our our interactions that court case\nComparatively speaking to U.S Department of justice has been very obstructive you know I think uh the OJ has essentially handle my case there the way they've been handling their interactions with Congress\nWho's who's also been trying to get to the bottom and it's a dodge he got the eighth a fiasco which created this whole mess for him to begin with so we'll see what happens you know it's it's very early days it's just filed a case a couple of days ago\nAnd um you know I'm I'm hopeful that this private law firm and this organization that the end\nOh the case a couple of days ago and um you know I'm I'm hopeful that this private law firm and this organization at the end say will uh will be a following the footsteps of a you know some of the media companies who are who have been relatively more", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Washington", "day": "25"}
