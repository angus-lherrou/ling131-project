she treated in the last few days which is let's bring up his perennial opponent tell her sweat for calling us he's always battling would tell her swept about something they they've offended each other somehow\nBut Taylor Swift up until a couple of days ago was not political she'd kept her mouth shut so how'd the media trade her for that\nShe wasn't adequately liberal\nShe hadn't sucker neck out on behalf of liberal causes in fact she may be a crypto fascist crypto Nazi right she was a ... do All right figure according to the press and I'm not making this up over the last few days I Can't tell you how many stories I've seen that said Taylor Swift disappoints\nAll right who's thought she was a secret All right racist member et cetera et cetera et cetera on and on and on so woman who doesn't speak up in politics who's a part of entertainment gets attacked for not speaking up and gets accused of being a Nazi\nThat's what happened is that we're swift and then she comes out\nAnd decides she's going to endorse Democrats in Tennessee and says you know woman is worth ...\nI'm going to support him over Marsha Blackburn Amman accuse her of being anti woman despite the fact that fills the man in that race and she's a woman who cares what I'd be going to think about that I'm going to cues Marsha Blackburn a baby at anti woman\nTaylor Swift actually here you go here's here's a terrorist ... the other day the same exact interview talking about how she's happy with Taylor Swift because of all this\nI applied I applaud that liquid for anything her platform judiciously and it would well thought out she didn't rant and rave about abolishing amendments or anything like like ... ... dead who would uneducated on things [noise] um he was ... it was a very thoughtful and good for her\nOh come on now you gotta be kidding me this after calling and calling and calling us the token negro the same woman is like you know he's doing great is that Taylor Swift [laughter]\nShe's a celebrity I thought why isn't the whole standard that we're supposed to just ignore them who cares your job is entertainment it's not to tell us how to live our lives are instructors on politics is not the point but no they're applying a separate standard is an unequal standard because it has to do with liberal politics all around us as a ... this morning is it lower Ronald Ronald thank you\nSorry well is

I Can't figure it out it's it's I Am sleep deprived I just like on ya\n[laughter] I just wanted to say after all of a show now\nAfter all of a sudden I've been saying I'm surprised you guys are even talking about it but I'm not really because you know it joints so much and you already joined it before I got to it yeah the swift and Kanye West's rivalry with both of them being in the news getting into politics at the same time uh\nAnd the thing is ... famously\nCalled jackass you know that's true in case of Adam ... up his rear end for a little while he wants to get back at the liberals that ah you know they have his back after he went on air and you know extended themselves and George Bush don't like black people yeah I'm\nSo that means that the theory Mike is that is that Conyers still harboring some resentment from when Obama\nSays to what he thinks is a room full of camera people who won't share of the video as like a ... he's a jackass remember this\nAnd it get down and it gets out and do you think Conway's counties just resentful and now this is payback time he's just embracing Obama he literally hug Trump tonight Mike He hugged him by the oval office or the cameras napping\nI don't know if I'm going to go that far just because\nI think I heard for a spot for pretty firm grasp of the concert what we're over here to grasp of the conservative talking points yeah he's he's not ignorant in that sense of I'm\nNot having read up on politics gets thrown up on the wrong sorts of politics he hasn't read enough about it they laid off into politics of race and all the rest up but it's definitely not a guy I Believe him when he says he tested at Ninety eight percent tile\nWell let me say this that Mike I mean you say you're liberated talk about it and and you're talking about politics and policies which by the way that's like the exact area of debate that we should be on any given day which is like hey we disagree on policies and here's why here's a compelling reason why we should tax people more attacks people laugh at center a\nButton said the treatment that Kanye West is getting from places like CNN Don Lemon the other day questioning his mental health\nAnd suggesting and just and laughing him off because he once checked into a mental hospital as weird position to be and if you're like a CNN where are you on one hand you're like well how could you you know we've got to take the stigma away from mental health problems and meanwhile then you turn around and you attack him and tease him and make fun of him\nBecause he doesn't agree with your politics do you think that's right in any way might\nDo that I think it's much more interesting to a much more of an interesting story back how he got to where is it is to take a cage Saddam ... yes\nLook here's a celebrity and a sense where you got what role is the same way saying the same thing which is set up and saying I always thought that was unfair when they're older so that we're all citizens of this great country\nI think that was already out\nThere to especially if you've got a following the discussion about oh yeah they didn't do that still is where they're doing it to this guy this really should be challenging him on his\nArguments rather than just disparaging I'm All right it's on the merits of the ones that\nI was talking to thank my thank you talk about how Kanye West actually got this way it's interesting because you remember Candace Owens the relationship has been maintaining with her she's black conservative who works for turning points usa alongside that guy Charlie Kirk\nOr they're too young people they've been chased out of restaurants by angry mobs of liberals and Candace apparently connected at one point with Tanya and they spent a lot of time together\nAnd she kind of lead into him about and he was asking a lot of questions which is a good operating position to begin to ask questions and to just be curious about the world and just think okay my writing and the kind of changed my mind about this and try and county was asking her questions apparently and she's the one\nWho brought him into this idea that you know maybe the magma has the right thing\nMaybe this is liberating maybe I should think about the world just a little bit differently than I than I always have I mean I even heard him today when he was in the oval office he was like renegotiating whether or not it was a good idea for him to attack George W. Bush\nBack when he did and that that could train and tell us on\nWas that a good idea he's coming out and he's saying that he felt like he was programmed to think differently at that time\nBut why the press so upset about this I'm asking this afternoon because typically you think about the way the press handle stories that they're uncomfortable with they ignored them it's called selection bias you just pick stories you actually like reporting on or you think fulfill your need whatever it might be and in this case it's unavoidable that the idea Kanye West big star\nThe oval office the biggest the most visible office in the world maybe it's to the point that this is Reese critical mass and they can do nothing but mock it as they did on MSNBC\nHere's a ... and ... this afternoon Matt Good afternoon sir\nAmazing thing the other day where they were telling the residents of the state of Florida in the panhandle to get out now before they eventually had to close the roads and I was saying is that how far the bureaucracy is gone the literally during a storm you have to close down the escape routes at some point do we think this stuff\nAnd that and the minute I'm Dennis Miller\nIf you were a level and struggles with leg cramps you've got to try Sarah\nWorks relieve this non greasy moments proven to relieve muscle cramps fast with daily use\nTheir works relief can even prevent muscle cramps you can get a full night's sleep or do activities you love without worry Sara works relief only takes ... minutes to apply absorbs quickly and it works there works relief as my choice for preventing and relieving muscle cramps get sterile works relief today and the pain relief\nOut at Walmart CBS Rite Aid Walgreens or at the\nFederal works released dot com\nOr whenever it rains it's hard not to think about the folks right here in our community who have no roof over their heads wouldn't it be nice to give them a dry place to sleep tonight or warm cup of soup or just simply an umbrella well you can by giving the salvation army for every donations fights for\nGo visit Salvation Army ... listen and give up on now to help fund programs that provide shelter food\nAnd hope to our neighbors most of that so they shouldn't army dog loose and and do dot or\nDo you what I Would watch WMA all washing\nDishes [noise]\nAnd they only use it for only Maria leave a heads up tonight if your travels take you along westbound Maryland route thirty two near Fort made two lanes closed right now due to a large sinkhole that's taken over the roadway we're not\nReally sure what happened yet we're still investigating that with our contractors in Arkansas it could be a pipe that was underground at just with all the rain that we've had since spring just finally gave\nThat Charlie ...
