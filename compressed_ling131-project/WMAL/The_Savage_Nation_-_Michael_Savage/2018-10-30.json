similar decision there is a decision in Nineteen eighty two that I mentioned where it had to do with children of illegal immigrants and whether they could get public benefits or not there's a a footnote that justice William Brennan wrote in it\nAnd listen you know I'm not a constitutional scholar but I've been reading things that people have been writing about all day on this I'd researched it on my own and that's the beauty of our constitution and our American republic is that the all the information is out there it's all pretty transparent and we can all it's all written in such a way that we can figure it out [noise]\nUm I don't think that that that Brennan footnote has in any way a appropriately interpreted uh it's been used by\nBureaucrats and buy a politicians to say you see this means illegal immigrants automatically get birthright citizenship hell no\nI Do believe though that based on the the Eighteen Ninety eight decision I think it is a ... a with regard to a one Kim art [noise] uh I Do believe Eighteen Ninety eight\nVets that they interpreted the language of the fourteenth amendment demean that if you are the child of naturalized or or a legal residents of this country you are a citizen\nAnd I think that the language of the fourteenth amendment even though the intent was obviously about the enslaved I think that the language is written in such a way that that does make sense as well that again that doesn't mean it can't be reinterpreted today based on what's going on in our country now or for that matter\nIt doesn't mean that we can't pass a new constitutional amendment so I guess the question is if you support the president's plan here\nTo do away with birthright citizenship I'd love to know where you're ... where you draw the line do you mean for only for illegal immigrants or do you also I mean if somebody is a legal resident of the country if they've got their green card they're doing it the right way they're not yet citizens and they have a child\nDo you think that child should be able to be a citizen or do you think that they shouldn't and also what's the best way to overdo this to to overrule this\nDo you like the president's plan with an executive order and then have that go to the courts do you want a law let that go to the courts or would you rather actually amend the constitution\nI guess there was a fourth way we could have a convention of the states in this could be this could be an amendment as part of the convention of the states that I'm not going to get emails from the convention to the states people so I Want to include that one as well other than that I don't see any other way to do it so you tell me what's the best ... six thirty W male chicken\nWith ed Rodriguez he's in the service and

the ... you would you agree there should be birthright citizenship regardless of circumstances for anyone who was born in this country at any time which is how it is right now\nI'd love to hear your position on that and I I'm fine with the president and with the policy of rescinding birthright citizenship and stopping the policy when they are the children of illegal immigrants absolutely and I'm willing to discuss the idea of children of legal residents but let's start with illegal immigrants with the legal residence\nPeople who are into this country illegally have a child why should that child be an automatic US citizen and I think they should not\nAnd then if if you agree with me on that on and at least that\nThen that means you've got four pads you get an article five convention you amend the constitution you pass legislation or you do an executive order those ladder to then get challenged in the courts all the way to the Supreme Court that's what the president is planning it appears with his executive order Mike in Springfield your first step on WMA oh where do you stand\nThere I was ... it legal should not be automatically given shift for the average child here I think the way it should be done it the way that it actually breed and the amendment that natural I finished eating\nImmigrants here illegally and are now under the jurisdiction of the United states government when they have a child your child become the United states citizen that the way that\nBeing said I think the president should go ahead and find the executive order\nLed the charge in court let go to the Supreme Court because we know that the way the Congress sets right now it's basically divided ... nobody's got sucked the potato with ... with which ... so you're ready to active and everybody's afraid of politically which is why nothing about it nobody wants that\nBut they still get ready to do and everybody's afraid of politically which is nothing nobody wants nobody wants to step up and hold\nOn the big bought it and do their job\nYeah Mike thank you I I don't disagree with you at all I and and for everybody who is saying oh the president thinks that his executive order can Trump the Constitution's well he's not really saying that although to be clear there is nothing in the constitution nor in this fourteenth amendment ... in the Supreme Court decisions\nCurrently up mould our policy a brand new citizenship [noise] children of illegal immigrants that just does not exist and that decision has not come down from the Supreme Court so in a way he's not suffering the constitution [noise] he's actually by executive order\nWouldn't come from Jose what country did you say you were from\nEl Salvador oh how ... how long have you been here\nI was born here\nOh you were born all okay so you're from from America\nOkay there you that this wave of immigrants to sell at ... years ago called ... where they work really pay their taxes they at least that every part of the book\nIs different this as a person who does he live each day thing\nGoes am I appreciate it and I appreciate you listening very much until your parents I said I'm Glad they did the right thing how about a Todd in Rockville touch your next up on WMA what do you say hey Laurie good after you're going to go to I think is the worst\nOff but the president should definitely uh for the ... or if or anything to escalate the issue I disagree to disagree with Ryan the president can cite national security can cite economic security reasons\nFor why we cannot be allowing illegal aliens come in here at birthright get citizenship I like to see something concrete word defined by Social Security tax\nPaying parents that are basically determined if you have a child and that child or become Citizens United states are all kinds of laws are being skirt and broken and the patient where there are businesses\nThat are welcoming people coming over here pregnant I'm renting houses and staying in place for you know a month to month the time they can have their kids here and have to become a U.S citizen and is that it's not right for me it's hot it's a new\nTire out I agree no go ahead and one more point one more point where the referendum about what what Americans think I'm I'm tired of Congress paying the American people want the American people walk put it out for a vote let America and voice their opinions on what I Want to say thank you\nToddlers and I don't want to go to a national referendum on things here I think that that's chaotic I I like the fact that we have representatives who we send to office every two years to do are bidding and if the nation votes\nAt all on mass on something it's for our chief executive it's for the president yes he's put an office via the electoral college but on one day we all votes on the same topic on the same idea who will lead our executive branch in the fact that matter is taught we did that already\nWe followed the process and the person who won that election is the exact same person who ran on this idea amongst others but he didn't hide this this is something he talked about all the time why are we doing this birthright citizenship thing\nUh so so I I don't like the idea of a national referendum I prefer having a presidential election where there are actual issues talked about everyone talks about how nasty the twenty sixteen presidential election was and how it was ugly and it was dirty and it was crazy it was chaotic and it was I guess in its own way\nBut you know unlike most of the presidential elections over the last Thirty years my adult life\nThis for the first time that I can remember was really about some substantive\nMeaningful issues it wasn't a personality contest it wasn't a a a soundbite competition it wasn't a beauty contest it wasn't about who looks cool on a late night TV show playing a saxophone\nThe president the man who eventually became president he laid out some very big bold controversial ideas and so we got some real problems here here's what's wrong here's what I'll do to fix them and he won\nAnd this is one of the issues that he put forth that he's going to end birthright citizenship now he can't singlehandedly do it's thank God we a president can't and shouldn't singlehandedly do anything\nIs this something that has to go through the process as I said you either amend the constitution through the usual way that we've been to the constitution or through the constitution of the states so that we can make it very clear exactly what we use the nation\nThrough the usual way that we've been in the constitution or through the constitution of the states so that we can make it very clear exactly what we as a nation expect\nFor citizenship for people who were born here and what their circumstances are or you pass legislation where you do an executive order then goes and makes its way through the courts\nAnd then the fourteenth amendment will have a chance to be looked at again for the first time on this issue since Eighteen Ninety eight do you think when the Supreme Court justice has made this decision and Eighteen Ninety eight\nWe had the same circumstances in this country that we have right now\nNow than I Am I Am an originalist I Want the language to mean exactly what the language means and what's going on in our country right now shouldn't shouldn't bear on on the decision making process for these justices\nBut the fact that we didn't have literally ... million people coming to this country illegally\nAnd then and then had a policy of chain migration\nFor the family members of those who were born here they can then bring them in here the fact that we didn't have a welfare state that we didn't have free benefits to people the second they came across that border the fact that none of that was part of the American conversation in Eighteen Ninety eight I think is quite relevant to this discussion\nDo you Bruce in Chicago Chicago your next up on WWE a male neighbors\nCongratulations on your research and on getting this exactly right I was unconscious for officer in the state department of foreign service officer back to the Nineteen eighties under President Reagan and well in our basic training at the foreign service Institute in those days this was an issue that was brought up\nAnd it was very clear at the time that this was purely a matter of interpretation of the constitution and the bureaucracy and those days you had the immigration and Naturalization Service ins and the state department the consular officers like myself\nWho had to interpret the immigration law\nAnd this was not a matter of the law or regulation it was purely a matter of interpretation largely because those are the bureaucracy dealing with immigration issues\nThat did not want to pick a fight on this issue with people who were you know the parents\nOf somebody born in the United states didn't want this to be something that you would expect the federal government to go to court to fight somebody who claims they have a right to citizenship and the government is out there fighting to prove that they don't have a right to censorship this was something that\nThe basic position ... look this is not worth the fight yeah\nAll right so you know like any resident alien who would have a child here who would be a citizen under the law under that the amendment\nUnder the ... under the Eighteen Ninety eight decision yeah\nYeah yeah exactly so there was precedent for that but there was ambiguity about what happens with illegal aliens and into the physician basically was look it's not worth the fight and if you think about it\nWhat happens when you if you tried to do a case like that if you tried to fight it out in the courts will end up with is you know these people would be calling their congressman and insisting it to you know people like Paul Ryan today\nIs that this was unfair that they were a citizen and you know you'd have them calling up the state department or the immigration people and saying this is ridiculous why are you\nPicking on this poor person and doing this show is politically it's a horrible issue\nYou know they don't want they don't want to fight it and so if this thing where to go to Congress and tried to legislate this should be a nightmare right only be such a fight there and the only one man who can who can make that has a right to do that yeah this is\nA symbol executive orders all these doing it she's telling that brought rusty hoops you have been doing it the wrong way this is the way it should be and that if they want to fight it up to the Supreme Court all\nThe immigration lawyers and all the activist groups if they want to make a case out of it and spend their by fighting at all the way up to the Supreme Court they're going to lose\nAnd by the way we got it absolutely right\nBruce while I've got you here because you identify yourself as a a former a counselor with the Reagan Administration [noise] I like you know when when we saw the mass shootings or did they got all the attention during the final years of the Obama administration\nDidn't he sign executive orders telling his Justice Department and the ATF and various agencies have you been interpreting our gun laws and our Second Amendment on the wrong way I Want you to start doing these things it's no different than that is it because then that would get challenged\nData that particular show I'm not certain on so I Can't really speak at All right oh but in the case of this and this was in our basic training base to concert of training you know for any vice consul started off with the foreign service all this was one of the topics that was covered it there and it was sort of\nYou know a ... a case example of something that was an odd situation\nThis was one of the topics that was covered there and it was sort of you know a a a case example of something that was an odd situation that you might not expect in reading and reading the law and the regulations\nAnd Bruce I I I Love live back\nTwists and turns that it was this was something that we were instructed on either because we had to decide you know if somebody eligible for a passport\nSure well and and Bruce I Love the fact that you've you've revealed to us and I have no doubt this is the case even under the Reagan Administration\nThat the feeling was ... you know this is not worth the fight this is not worth it it's not worth the political fallout it's not worth you know I I agree of course it was listen to ... and they picked a couple of flights to fight on and they were damn good at it and thank God they want as many fights as they did\nBut for the last Thirty years or so it is has not been worth the fight but this is a man who ran on this issue and said you know what it's time to fight this thing it's time to have a defined definitive\nAnd over time of its own and

Larry O'Connor\nYou at for a very O'Connor's show in a few minutes we're going to take them with Robin Ficre Republican candidate for county executive that three way race is very interesting\nAnd those are those are two election day joining us right now representative Dave Brat incumbent congressman and the seven congressional district to a well based on the latest public holes in his neck and neck race right now although of course you know those are just\nPolls I'm Wondering how the congressmen himself is feeling a deep breath thanks for joining us ... well the public polls are often in my opinion often under so many Republicans performance but you tell me what's the state of the race last time we spoke to felt pretty confident\nYeah now we were in her new port that got an academic liberal\nBastion they usually poll viewpoints toward the Democrats in the path so we haven't seen any of those numbers like that and I don't think they're spanberger camp seen anything like that or they would have reported it so we're still feeling good job but we got it's a tough race they I think she's raised about six million or just you know buying the election\nAnd we're not used to that that piece is it just wall to wall TV fall TV ad on the biggest issue of last year which\nI find it amazing the mainstream media has been covered at this at all and that's the debate over whether the Republicans provided preexisting conditions\nAnd my opponents up it's nationwide a Democrat tactic they're saying Republican\nUh didn't provide the folks with preexisting conditions there within the Republican bill we passed the house and that the mainstream media is just accommodating that's really the only issue the Democrats are running on me and it's a total flop\nAnd they don't have much more because on the economy will just stick a crushing it right now right the economy is booming for point two percent last quarter three and a half lowest unemployment rates in in his great for a women and African Americans twenty five hundred dollars back of your pocket for the\nFor the average uh Virginia family that's that's a big money and an immigration there's a caravan headed here my opponent is\nOpen borders for sanctuary cities she said the localities can deal with it really I mean she's a federal law enforcement background\nAnd is basically telling the American people what Nancy Pelosi and the leftist Taliban and that's it or the federal law of the lambs don't cooperate with ice and the fads\nAnd anyone is welcome and the tax payer will bear any burden and uh I think the American people are seeing through time so I I think there is a quiet majority out there and that we're going to see him come home at the Republicans are unified as we've we've ever seen in the district\nAnd that everybody's working together and they're just huge energy right now so I think they were going to be a person that there's\nDave Brat as our guest and uh you know you mentioned some of the ads that they're running against you and I I've heard a couple of 'em and your opponent is remarkable to me your opponent claims that she will\nStories breaking well you've been we're\nUsed to live real controversial\nBut we're one week from election day I Want to remind you that I'll be giving you\nLive elections are here on W E mail from nine until midnight and maybe beyond as we look at the house races and now the house of representatives might be shaping up it'll be myself plenty of yes a symbol Hannon\nNews a whole lot of surprises and we'll be checking in on a lot of the campaign [noise] some of the victory parties maybe we'll be calling Robin Ficre for his victory party in Montgomery County as county executive how's it looking there Mr Ficre how's the race shaping up here\nYou're going to be calling me Larry because\nWe don't want any more tax increases in Montgomery County I'm not going to give any more tax increases and I'm running against to Ben Jealous term limited tax increase specialists who were there to deciding vote for any nine percent property taxes and Craig\nIs that Robin you know the Montgomery County council is a new voting today on this smoking ban for outdoor places ... it's like anything that people are enjoying and that actually elicits freedom in this county they want to vote against it and restrictive what would county executive Ficre do with the smoking ban\nWell I Am not a smoking than I have to tell you it's the number one health hazard but I also don't like to tell other people what to do I I don't want smoking in the buildings but outdoors I think that that's a freedom and America's the country of freedom\nWhat a what a what a what a beautiful answer that is a Robin what else would you do in Montgomery County with regard to our schools whenever I talk to the residents of Montgomery County the biggest complaint as the degradation of the schools and you talk to anybody on the council around the school board they say they don't have any money\n[noise] well they've got over half our budget I Am going to sit in on the school board meetings not participate but I Want to learn all the ins and outs and where all the money is going because the school board candidates I've talked to they're all fine ladies\nBut they need to be a little more thrifty I think we need to focus on the classroom you know Aristotle uh taught Alexander the great and he didn't have a lot of men are sprayers looking over his shoulder we need to focus on the classroom\nA Robin how is the race shaping up in Europe and he lives in Europe political observer as well as a candidate and this is very odd to have this three way race where you've got to Democrats one running as an independent\nAnd then a Republican who you're pretty well known I mean you've you've actually you've frankly you were on the ballot with the term limits the other uh the last election and boy did you went overwhelmingly with the term limit issue how do you think\nWe got we got Seventy percent in of course of course both my opponents in this race were very much oppose the term limits I I debated Nancy on this subject and she said the term limits were bunk and it wasn't going to pass in March\nOr heat finance they've frivolous law suits and try to keep term limits off the ballot but term limits let's face it that was a vote for change it was not a vote to continue those in office that was a vote to retire those in office\nAnd it was a vote for new ideas for fresh ideas and we need to bring some jobs in\nWell how do you think the votes are breaking when you're when you're running against two Democrats won as an independent or did it and this is a weird dynamic for ... what's your take\nWell I first of all she's not an independent unaffiliated ... says oh on the ballot\nUnaffiliated an unaffiliated candidate has never ever won an election in Maryland I I think that mark ... is way out there with some of his views have hated the gridlock candidate against every new road project and for every CPAC graves\nAnd by the way I don't know if you saw this because you're busy campaigning Nancy florine has announced that the day after the election she'll go back to being a Democrat again it was just a a crass political move to drop the D so she could get on the ballot without actually participating in the primary\n[noise] well you know I respect everyone's chance to get on the ballot this is the greatest country in the world we we bring about change peaceful change we don't fight we don't shoot people to bring about change\nAnd and I think that she has a right to run but she also has a right to lose and that's what's gonna happen here because she you know she is she is really committed the biggest fall stood in the campaign where she has said that Shane\nShane was exercising budget chair ray Russ Crane in two thousand ten when she had increased the residential energy tax one hundred fifty six percent and she was exercising but Terry was right in two thousand sixteen when she had increased the real estate transfer jak thirty percent and the property tax\nIt's your seizing but Terry was right in two thousand sixteen once you get increased the real estate transfer jak\nThirty percent and the property tax nine percent we don't need that kind of budgetary restraint ideal the one that exercise but you're right because I got the charge or a madman through over their opposition which requires a unanimous vote\nTo increase property tax revenue more than the rate of inflation and George Allen the former governor of Virginia said\nHow did you ever get that passed this the only place in the country as far as I Know where requires the anatomy his vote to raise that\nThey could be the greatest tax said big piece of legislation that McHenry county has ever seen or maybe we'll see unless Robin bigger actually does when the county executive race Robin this is your final chance in your final thirty seconds or make your case to the voters\n[noise] well I'm going to improve I two Seventy we need to do something about that section from\nMontgomery village north the clerks bird we need to widen that American Legion bridge which was built one the population of the county was four hundred thousand now at one point one million I'm not going to give you any tax increases that I'm going to be friendly\nOpen and welcoming the all new businesses I've never met a Montgomery County and I didn't like it I'm going to treat everyone with dignity and respect\nRobin Ficre thank you for joining us sir and I look forward to call you on election night thank you Larry that is Robyn Ficre Republican nominee from a gum re county executive and by the way I Do I'm sure that you've seen the other candidates running for that same office if you've ever heard a more detailed\nOn the issues presentation from any of the candidates in Montgomery County about the things that really matter to you as
