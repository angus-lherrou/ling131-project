Congress shall we took our show on the road this morning we don't always do this where you interview people and then play them later in the program of course everything happens live here generally every afternoon but tastes like labor and a great producer and I had it on to the White House there early in the morning before the sunrise actually\nAnd I'm getting all set up for this thing that they've set up and we're over in the old executive office building the Eisenhower building right beautiful building we've got a beautiful view of the White House we're all set up ready to go there were like\nWhat was it for for radio shows were there so we're very honored as always we were the only one from Washington DC included always on her to be a part of the is a freight\nEvents and we're about to start and just like the last time when we were down in the East Room and we did this radio row or in the White House right before we started we were told are just so you know if everything works out right\nYou're going to get an interview with the president right and and there it was kinda you know we were in the East Room and of course his offices right down the hall in the west wing just kind of easy for him to just go to roll out of the office had down the hall\nAnd give us some interviews so things are about to get started we're about to the interviews and the guys come over and they say uh ask us about some of the technical aspects of our set up because they want to you know grab an audio of all of our interviews if we are to interview the president and the vice president\nAnd we looked around them he said well we we are you saying that we are going to interview the president and the vice president and they said we just need to be prepared\nFor an interview with the president or vice presidents like oh okay All right so we're all that so we get our technical thing all set up and everything's ready to go and about an hour into that a Mercedes slept for about the player interview with Mercedes slap in a moment you can hear and she you know we we go way back workout so she pulled me aside and she goes so um I just want to let you know\nThat um we're being told that there's potentially a suspicious package or potential incendiary device at the White House [noise]\nAnd I'm like why why do you remember earlier in the day there was this report there was this story now the secret service about you know twenty minutes into that story being put out there the secret service put the kibosh on it and said no they've investigated there is no suspicious package\nBut after you serious are you serious ... and she said yeah and I said why do you know everything's okay they're secure I look out the window there still seems to be a school group out there\nAnd she says no no no everything's fine we're just we're following protocols but what it means is um you know anyone who's here right now it has to stay in the building and anyone who's over in the White House they're pretty much going to stay in the White House\n... a man seriously and and I know that that's a small thing considering the the fear that people had been expressing today and we've seen a lot of it up in New York when they had to\nEvacuate the CNN Time Warner building there around Columbus Circle which by the way a ironically I don't know if they caught this and the shots when they showed everybody pouring out of the time Warner building CNN in Columbus Circle you know that right across the street from the Trump International hotel Columbus Circle\nSo they were all like leaving the building and started hanging out on the sidewalk in front of the Trump Hotel [noise] um I Know that this was you know obviously there are are bigger issues today\nBut it did definitely put a bit of a monkey wrench into what we were hoping was going to be another opportunity to interview the president and or the vice president today\nA but we did get quite a bit Don and we're going to tell you more about it including\nUm like I said my interview with Mercedes thought senior advisor to president coming up also in the next sixty minutes we're going to speak with the secretary of labor Alexander Acosta and the secretary there'd be a Robert Wilkie I'll also\nPresident coming up also in the next sixty minutes we're going to speak with the secretary of labor Alexander Acosta\nAnd the secretary there'd be a Robert Wilkie I'll also a place for you what the president did have to say about these explosive devices that were found he gave a briefing right before his events for the opioids signing the bill at the signing of the bill for opioid\nFrom the opioid crisis giving parents the tools that they need to help their children with substance abuse being able to expand the public awareness campaign something that the president has talked about time and time again this\nIs something actually that's a really brings President Trump and Mrs Trump together on an issue that's very personal said that we know President Trump's ... brother died of addiction\nAnd he talks about that story and it it really is heartfelt because he's explained the dangers of addiction and what we see with opioids is that it could be a kid who broke\nHis shoulder or or you know what I'm basically\nA freak accident is the gateway to show that ...\nIt all starts in the in your in your cabinet so your medicine cabinet and you have these opioids in there that are prescription drugs and that's how it all stars and the ending is terrifying and so while we have seen a plateau in the number of opioids\nThat it's it's really not enough and this is why the signing of the such as I said it's so critical in addition to the fact that President Trump has secured six billion dollars in opioids funding is going to the state's going to these local programs to help families rebuild\nTheir lives it's not only about on prevention and it's not only about helping\nIndividuals who are currently suffering through this crisis but it's also about education it's about teaching argue\nThat ah that that opioids is it very very addictive and this is why you're having in several states and pushing forward opioids curriculum to help there are children understand the dangers of opioid\nAnd let's talk about that primitive because I think that especially when we see the push for legalization of marijuana or at least medical marijuana in various states will tell you that you're in Washington and Marilyn that's already gotten through um there is a very important difference in the station and I think that uh our young people do need to learn that it's like okay your parents may be okay with pop at the same the safe right\nAnd and the reality is going into the even the marijuana component is that there are horrible dangers associated with youth\nSmoking pot because what happens is is that many times you start with pot you end with opioids and with alcoholism I mean so again this is the idea that when you're dealing with young minds so important to send that message to our children\nAbout opioids one of the things I learned this week and I had the conversation you know all my children with the two older girls I might add vaping is very popular right now and one of the things that FDA I'm director Scott Gottlieb has pushed toward is looking to regulate the the vaping company why because the kids are saying oh it's bubblegum\nRight oh Andy out Harry flavored well the reality is again if you start with the taping leads to horrible medical consequences including lung cancer and he got a young age and then it leads to the other\nDrove it doesn't but then when they get in their product to get\nIts understanding that danger than as parents we have that responsibility\nBut one of the big point the President Trump has made in particular when it comes to opioids is the shock ads I don't know if you've seen them they're all on television or the administration has worked with a truth initiative they launched these\nPublic ads and it's about the shocking at it's like you know when you see the tobacco act as a woman who can't speak anymore\nBecause she was she just well it's the same concept is this idea of seeing a person detox\nLive going through that experience it's about the the voice story of he broke his shoulder and you know what if he would do he would break his shoulder over and over again to be able to get these opioids it is incredibly addictive and we're looking to expand this research\nTo non opioid prescription drugs to ensure that there's other alternative\nUm you know maybe it's about taking a Tylenol or an Advil instead of going into the dangers of what we've seen with opioids were speaking\nWith Mercedes swap of course used one of the senior advisors and the communication shopping for the president here in the White House last question Mercedes slap as we're seeing these are the people coming up from Guatemala Honduras El Salvador coming across Mexico and we keep hearing this term refugees and asylum thrown around these are people who have economic hardships yet\nThese are people who are coming from a country with crime but that's not political asylum you were actually the child have red lines you use fresh Cuba please make that decision and also it's important\nIt's but it's also very important to understand that they the the Central Americans are being taught I mean there are people who train these individual illegal aliens coming in to say when you go through the border when you go through these poor country you need to use the word credible\nFear [noise] what do you use the word credible feel fear they put you into the asylum category so guess what you wait two or three years together we change our liberty or\nCan we just say okay critical for is no longer the key word take\nI Love category so guess what you wait two or three years to get it we change our liberty or\nCan we just say okay credible fear is no longer the key word\nCakes congressional action and what we have seen is that President Trump for over a year had made it a point to say I want to negotiate with the Democrats we need to close these legal loopholes we need to make these significant changes in the law\nAnd what the Democrats have done is they have refused to come to the table\nThey are the party of open borders they do not protect our national sovereignty and they do not protect our rule of law and that to me it's incredibly disheartening because at the end of the day where you are seeing our criminal organizations leftist groups organizing these caravans are seeing another one pops up and down Salvador\nComing our way and we had no way to stop it and that to me it's so\nDisheartening because these individuals are being used as political pawns are being used as human shields and you have the cartels any criminal organization\nAnd Venezuela helping to fund this ... this caravan and making sure that they sell chaos within the United states and we need to\nHold on a news Bennett says we approve another Venezuela or money is coming from Venezuela hopes on this organization or from the government\nIt's that it is from the way their own pick their own people but it is part of the left wing group as well as involved that we we have sources that are ... that have shared that with us and Israel habit car cartels involved in this process there are missing children in the caravan\nBecause what they're doing is that they're using these individuals as human shields they want us so chaos within the United states and we don't have the mechanisms to stop\nBy the way the fascinating that the reporters who were down there marching with these people they're not asking the question here where somebody coming from now they're not actually I Believe that that would be part of the store\nAnd they want to talk about the ... like I think what's so disturbing is that\nWe have a legal immigration system the president wants to push a merit based immigration which of those individuals with the skills to a man and match up what we need in terms of our economy\nBut more importantly is we're a nation of borders and we are in ... ... our national sovereignty is key and the Democrats have no respect for that they do not have respect for national sovereignty they do not have respect for national borders and they're using these illegal aliens you know black yes yesterday\nThe boarding cross border crossing numbers in family units alone it's over a hundred and sixty one thousand family unit that have come through because they know the legal loopholes yes to contain the United states you know what happened they come through twenty days later based on what we have which is a Florida agreements twenty days later they released into the interior because\nWe haven't been able to process them and give them their

White House earlier\nCovering their big roll out of there are a solution and there are plans for the opioid crisis in America this was a truly bipartisan bill that was signed into law today\nWe were able to interview a tons of the cabinet level secretaries and by the way all these interviews of course will be available there on our show dot com certain Mercedes slap make a little bit of news in our interview she confirmed that their understanding of the White House that Venezuela in part is funding this caravan marching afford our border that\nKind of a big deal also Ben Carson earlier in the program right now I'm going to start our interview with the secretary Alexander Acosta department of labor and we discussed of course how this opioid crisis has affected a labor and the economy in this country and what he plans to do about it here's the secretary\nWe continue with our very special event here at the White House if the HR six day which is legally use for\nThe government is doing something about the opioid crisis and joining us talk about that as secretary of labor Alexander Acosta thanks for joining us are glad to be here at talk a little bit I don't think when people you know somebody talked to housing and urban development health and Human Services department of agriculture I I don't think people think oh how does this affect the labor force why don't you tell well let me\nLet me take a step back and talk about that because I think\nAmericans need to understand how her ... says this crisis is\nThe fear of Labor Statistics the same folks that measure all the unemployment data\nForty four percent of adult men not working took a pain killer not last month or last week but yesterday\nWhile nearly one third\nTook a prescription pain killer yesterday\nSo when you have something and we're getting the same data for women but you have something that is affecting one third\nOf adult men not working you understand how pervasive descent you know so it affects all those people that affect everyone who's working on my test positive and lose their job it affects everyone who might have an injury on the job because of drugs on this is a crisis that we need to address so what\nIn HR six addresses that from the labor perspective in terms of you know somebody gets injured on the job they go on there on disability big it prescribes is and then they're stuck\nWell you know one of the things that that it's happening where the ... the bill or is that the law in essence out sets up treatment facility and does treatment facilities will focus not just in helping people get get over their addiction\nBut helping them with job training with job placement because if you get over an addiction and then you don't have a job\nWhat are the odds that you go right back to where you are right now that we need to work in a job after ... have\nYou been able to wear your department or any of the think tank in town but able to do any sort of analysis about uh the cost of this crisis I mean listen we're talking about the human cost of a sudden there's no dollar sign on that\nSecretary Robert Wilkie a pretty new to the position right weeks\nB a secretary Robert Wilkie a pretty new to the position right we expanded\nYou but you're one of the lucky ones you have to get confirmed how many of the the appointments are waiting to be ... got confirmed eighty\nSix votes yeah and five Republicans were stuck on a plane in Chicago so otherwise that claim that it would have been higher absolutely or would have been and that speak highly of view I come from a long history and your family of a military service and so I'm sure that this job must mean a lot to you to ... to give you\nHit needs a lot to me that's been my world um I came to it from being the under secretary of defense a general matter sustain\nA my father a combat soldier from Vietnam so I saw the effects that are very early age of\nTo a soldier wounded in combat and that was on my mind\nWhen the president asked me to serve\nWelcome to talk about how that works in to the story of the day six in the opioid crisis when I asked for people to call and tell us their stories a lot of times it's like there this is a major issue with our\nBut we have we have a forty percent higher rate of chronic pain\nThan the general public does use my father is an example\nThirty years of jumping out of airplanes [noise] huge man six to two forty\nNeeding to new knees to New Hampshire has a bad\nWar ones from Vietnam that somebody who will be suffering pain for the rest of his life\nWhat is new about BPA is that we are actually doing things that would have been in comprehensible to my father's generation chiropractor tai chi yoga we're trying to get at\nThe pain in non traditional ways and it is a it's an instance where the VA is actually on the cutting edge\nAnd an example for the rest of the country and the other thing we're doing [noise] we have protocols last [noise]\nAre doctors have to follow [laughter] we have to try alternative medicine in the sense that instead of a Tylenol three\nWe'll put a combination of of aspirin and Taiwan altogether aspirin an Advil and we find in most cases that works just as well as an opioid [noise]\nAnd it's become so easy for doctors sadly and then that's not their fault necessarily they weren't completely writer what was going but so easy to just prescribed is up and now we know the consequences secretary Robert Wilkie as the secretary of the Veterans Administration and you're talking about what you do for the vets when they get their care and the ... the attention you're getting to it\nThere's still a bureaucracy problem with the V. A. there's still an issue with them getting the care how\nAre you progressing there and oh you only but on the job for a month\nAnd are we able to open up an alternative avenues for her so that they're not stuck in that there are\nGoing to be the beauty of what we are going through now we're going through the greatest transformative period in VA since Omar Bradley rented after World War two how\nWe're opening up the aperture of choice\nSo that our veterans will have an opportunity to see the care that they want if that means outside of the VA we will take that can you do from the executive branch and how much required well Congress has given us tremendously way the mission act was a revolutionary thing\nBecause it's sad and legislative intent was to put the health of the veteran at the center\nOf the veterans Experian imagine that being revolutionary that is revolutionary not\nCentered and we are taking that\nAnd I believe the president will be announcing major reforms changes in the way we do business in the state of the union um which will be an eye opener\nBut again it will put that veteran at the center of the care not at the whim of the bureaucracy not at the whim of protocols some of which were developed went Omar Bradley ran the place in the Nineteen forties\nYou know so often when we do our annual Fisher house radio the atmosphere I'm sure you're familiar with coming up this December and I talked to the incredible veterans and their families who are good what we can get their care\nThrough the VA they often have glowing things have say and that story doesn't get out as much because there are major problems at the VA especially in this area really really strong and doing doing God's\nWorld that your previous question actually hit on what I discovered coming from the Pentagon it is not the medical care that our veterans complained about\nProblems are administrative and bureaucratic it's getting the veteran and his family into the system can I ask you\nThen because when this issue comes up and I I'm Sorry for interrupting yeah but but I I gotta say whenever there is a problem with in a bureaucracy and the private sector people get fired and things get read bill right and we haven't seen enough headlined coming from the VA about you know what these guys were messing up and they're gone\nWell you just you just mentioned the DC area we are replacing the\nMedical center director here in DC we're replacing the VA medical center director in Atlanta uh we're doing that ascribe across the country\nI'm the president has given us unique authority\nThere in Atlanta we're doing that screw up across the country\nThe president has given us unique authority to replace um employees of our department in a way that\nOther departments do not have and I tend to make full use of that\nYou are from an army family yes you served in the air force and they still serving still serving air force and a coming up on December it is a big football game in Philadelphia yes and I'm going to be there you going to be there you know the air force calls that the constellation allergies so I guess you answer my question about who you root for\nAs I get therefore it's already being navy the later on and not play it on\nAnd then you guys are just going to watch from the side just watching that you already have the grinder and elderly unbelievably go navy army thinker and by the way even more important than all of that and being the secretary of the VA your big WMA oldest\nAnd yes I Am listening to you since you came and then you switch from the mornings\nAfter I'd heard about that yeah that that you say that like it's a bad\nThing no well it's a bad thing for me because I'm In the office I'm not driving in the evening only there was a way\nFor you to listen in the office as early as if anyone can help the secretary out with that he hasn't quite figured out how to use the app on his phone perhaps herself they lost last December ... the important thing is you don't listen to Chris plans and that that's the important thing is the last thing I Need is for him to know that a cabinet secretaries listening to him and the secretary represent a gay I think it will have you back\nI Know they knew it in the job and love for the Fisher has where do you have to go to our friends that Fisher has said thank you for everything we continue here at the White House in a moment Larry O'Connor on WWE a mail\nAt four twenty five now there by the way I was here because I ... you may have missed the headline

him about this important issue and also but some of the other thing they were dealing with there in the White House and they're a\nCommunications needs also we're going to check in with Dr John holidays from but that's a local guy who was actually very much involved in the solutions to the opioid crisis he was at the big signing event in the East Room and we'll check in with our holidays\nThe local guys who is actually very much involved in the solution to the opioid crisis he was a big signing events in the East Room and we'll check in with our holiday the momentum and\nIt's that black market if those ingredients coming in from China and Mexico across our border that is really fueling that that ancillary drug trade that that really devastating people's lives what's in this case stop\nIt's so powerful and so deadly a and one of the things you just mentioned I think they've ah this year already sees two thousand pounds of fat and all\nAre at the southern border alone and you know you don't need much of this drug to become hooked or to die from it so it's that dangerous one of the things we're looking at and and to bring in something that's going on right now is the is the ... the migration\nAs I was headed headed up the border and I got to write a reason to be take those very serious it is it's drug\nCartels or drug lords and and the southern uh areas past are born in Mexico who are leading the charge on some of this stuff and using you'll is to get them across our border [noise]\nUm it is it is a is grotesque the abuse that's going on for the people heading up this way but also it's dangerous to the people in this country and there's no way to check them at the border than these types of drugs coming to this country and ruin lives\nYeah and we're going to get it along that that thought process I got to ask you since you work in the crush of\nIt's got to be frustrating when you see you know cable news is doing nonstop coverage of of what they're calling the caravan these thousands of people who are coming toward our border with the intent on coming into our country and then when the president talks about it raises awareness about it raises legit concerns about it\nThey you know take issue with the fact that the president is is paying attention to their own coverage for crying out loud and that's exactly right it\nAnd and and it's something we we've talked about in the past because look the president put forth a Seventy point plan like two October's ago and\nDemocrats didn't want to touch it so the president drill down and makes it a lot simpler into those four pillars so we did that or you'll remember in January and Schumer and Pelosi and and and to some degree the president a Obama and Hillary Clinton all worked to shut that down to\nEven though they were for border security fair and I'm a wall just just a few years ago [noise]\nUm so we try to return to get something lasting that actually protects the people in this country and Democrats has stood in the way time and time again they refused to come to the table no one's asking Chuck Schumer why he changed his position no one's asking Nancy Pelosi why she changed her position Dianne Feinstein ths Hillary Clinton Brock Obama they're not asking those questions\nBecause they know the calculus has changed politically and they know the answer\nAnd you know they're also not asking any of these prominent Democrats and the ones who are looking to win back majorities next two weeks from now they're not asking them okay what do you do what is your solution you've got thousands of people come into the border here the other time for you to step up and actually assume responsibility that's\nSomewhat of a misnomer and I'm going to tell you why the\nWhat they want to do is just leave it open to leave it as it is because people don't understand\nWhat we reject any maybe they'd be done nothing is done because a voting bloc for them they feel they made the political calculus three things that really happens if his first\nBecame an issue um one is that the problems got a job and only worse\nToo is um Donald Trump's president and ensure hate that and then three is the political calculus has changed for them they want these voters to come over here and vote for them and that's what's so disgusting about this are standing with people hundreds of thousands\nOf them are here illegally and unlawfully as opposed to hundreds of millions of American citizens who deserve that protection from the federal government\nAnd they're refusing to address look\nWe literally apprehend a hundred percent of the people coming from Central America in this country we do the problem is there's no mechanism to send them back\nAfter so when they get here regardless of the claim of asylum regardless of credible fear regardless of what they claim we have to put them into a system we have to release them in twenty days family unit single adults and uh I'm I'm not young people are minors\nAnd we have no way of sending them back home [noise]\nNow that's the problem and in two thousand this happened under a Bush but that was Mexico we could send them back to Mexico and a couple of days that's why you understand now the numbers coming from Mexico are miniscule the numbers from Central America have grown exorbitant\nHogan last question listen we are talking to a church as today we're talking to us da talking to you know that but this opioid issue\nReally is across the board and our government beer communications Geiger politics guy there's a political aspect of that this is a promise made by the president I was there in New Hampshire does victory rally he told the people of New Hampshire I'm not going to forget you I'm not going to forget the opioid crisis how important is that the president's ... spots\nIt's ... it's very important that I Do think we've seen record setting results in record setting time and that's something so foreign to Washington DC uh and this president is moving on Donald Trump time I heard so many people tell me\nAll this town is going to shake the president he's going to understand there's no way you can get these they don't want to hear that but I still waiting you have to wait on the bureaucrats in the beltway and he said no we're not going to do that we're going to my way and I think now he's actually shaped this town\nDid you hear that hip it still waiting\nYou have to wait on the bureaucrats in the beltway and he said no we're not going to do that we're going to my way and I think now\nHe's actually shaped this town I mean we're finishing signing this bill today will probably do two or three more issues we have to cover today as well because the president didn't take a victory lap for six months and say look at me look at me pat me on the back he says there's still people out there struggling suffering in various ways we're going to work to fix it and he's about accomplishments and that's always been about from the from the beginning\nWhite House deputy press secretary Hogan good leader part of the communications and crush up for the White House and you look a surprisingly calm
