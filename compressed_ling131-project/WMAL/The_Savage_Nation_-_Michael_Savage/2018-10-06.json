L.\nToday's show is provided for entertainment and general information purposes opinions expressed or those at the present early we make no promises are guarantees of investment performance online training academy is not a broker dealer certified financial planner or register investment advisor enjoy the show\nFor the loser some\nFinancial market for sponsored online for how to be tough to show how long have\nYou been helping individuals like you become do yourself investors since Nineteen Ninety seven online training academy as two campuses to serve our listening audience one at Tyson's corner in one near BWI Airport\nAnd the past few weeks we've been talking about some of the strategies you can do to emulate what the financial services folks charge you for\nAnd ways to reduce your fees and expenses and basically keep them in your own pocket as opposed to giving them to a stranger so a couple of weeks ago we talked about building your own a new witty and the same side and walk us through how we would use our user assets protected from market risk\nMetro there was no downside but then also use that use that the income to buy options on the ... five hundred so we'd have no stock market risk and have stock market upside and be able to do that for the long haul which is basically what\nThe ... the the professional annuity folks are doing and what they're doing for the privilege is it they're charging high fees high expenses ... are the highest be ... highest commission product available for financial services\nSo there's a time when a new T. makes a lot of sense when you're in the deep human relation phase and so as you're entering retirement or later on in life it might make sense to have an annuity but it would make more sense\nIf you were able to manage the avenue to yourself and keep the fees and expensive in New York\nMight make sense to have an annuity but it'd make more sense\nIf you were able to manage that annuity yourself and keep the fees and expenses in your pocket as opposed to give him to someone else\nAnd also last week we talked about building a diversified portfolio and really simplifying that down now one of the things that the financial services folks always talk about his importance of a financial plan\nAnd you know if you have you know millions of dollars are several hundred thousand dollars no bill ... produced a financial plan for you for a thousand or two thousand dollars or more than that\nAnd then they'll charge you a fee to maintain that plan and invariably the financial services plans are passive investing plans so the idea is you're going to pay us money and you're gonna keep paying us money for the privilege of not having to do anything and\nThat's okay and that that may be a valid choice for you and where you're at in life\nAnd the only thing that most people are on when we called the I don't know retirement plan when we ask you what\nAre you invested in I don't know what price did you pay on your last paycheck into your four one K. I don't know what\nWhat returns have you gotten over the last three six twelve month I don't know\nAnd most people you know the whole idea is out of sight out of mind and the financial services people love that because if you don't care about the results neither today\nAnd the people are going to be held accountable if you're on you know on the alert and saying I Need returns they're going to be a lot more paying attention then if someone doesn't care at all and the problem for huge following this I don't know retirement plan it's based on this financial plan of trusting that you're going to get a nice straight line return\nAnd if you look at the straight line even getting about three percent per year over the last Eighteen years and so for most people that's not enough to get them to a hundred years old\nIt's really not enough to get you to Seventy for most people\nAnd so part of this as a starting to take a harder look at what you're doing and they were talking about building the success plan as kind of court to what we do for yourself investors\nAnd you know if you go to a financial advisor they're gonna charge you know a thousand two thousand dollars and they're going to focus primarily on we referred to as preservation strategies and their peace of mind strategies these are in strategies allow you to sleep at night so that's okay\nBut for most people if that's all you've got then you're not going to have the income you want to make sure current needs and you're certainly not going to have the income for the future that's going to allow you to get to a hundred years old\nAnd so preservation important and for a lot of people you know ... those are things that you can do yourself instead of paying the financial services folks to do and it does take a little bit and all it takes a little bit of education and what it really takes that you have to actually care about your money\nYou actually have to care about the results that your money or producing if you don't care that keep doing what you're doing if you do care if you want to take control of your assets than you owe to yourself to get yourself educated and so if we're looking at some of the some of these basic living\nExpenses and most people have that covered if their Social Security through their job and then it's then it's getting onto like once you've accumulated some assets water some of the strategies you can use and do it in a way we can reduce your expenses and these\nAre the most straightforward one is using exchange traded funds or a T apps and ATF have been around for Thirty years and you have ... about ten years ago there was a big push to them\nAnd part of it is it's they can be lower cost lower fee\nOpportunities they're not always that so you do have to know what you're putting your money and\nBut the most basic approach if you'd barely care about your results and you're satisfied getting you know single digit returns on your money rather than paying someone else you know two three four percent a year and allowing your money to have expenses taken out of it and one of the things you can do is hold that in exchange traded fund\nAnd do what they call it sixty forty split\nSo sixty percent exposed to the larger stock market\nForty percent exposed to a larger bond market\nAnd you can use an ATF call SP wide attract the larger market you can use a ... a ATF called TLC which tracks the long bond market tracks twenty year bonds and so if you use that sixty forty split and you're satisfied with single digit returns basically you know once a year once a quarter\nYou know you might rebalance that to make sure that you're sixty forty balances there but that's something you can do relatively easily\nAnd you get to keep the two or three percent that you're paying to the mutual fund you get to keep the two or three percent that you're paying your financial adviser and that way you're going to allow yourself to get better preservation returns and this is something that's a real simple strategy and it plays out you can do even rebounds as you add contributions\nBut that's a real simple preservation strategy can use\nIf you get more sophisticated and recognize where you're at you might want to look at some other strategies so\nStrategy can use\nIf you get more sophisticated and recognize where you're at you might want to look at some other strategies so most people\nHave all of their assets denominated in the U.S dollar and the U.S dollar has been the currency it's been a the global currency it's the reserve currency and most countries have it and so it's been able to maintain its significance regardless of normal market forces because it is the dominant force\nBut one of the things you have to recognize with the changes that are going on with America's relationship with the world that impacts the value of the dollar\nAnd so in two thousand Seventeen the dollar was down ten percent\nSo you may not know it but the value of your assets last ten percent so if you make ten percent you also lost ten percent said basically broke even and most people didn't make ten percent last year so you probably lost some money now this year it's been interesting 'cause we've been you know down five percent up five percent were basically at break even for the year basically\nAnd one of the things that we've seen this movie before you know the government is pursuing these pro oil policy pro producer policies that from two thousand one to two thousand eight the value of the u._s. dollars basically cut in half\nAgainst the Australian dollar and a number of other currencies and so one of the things you can do it from a preservation strategy\nAnd what that means the dollar gets weaker and continues to get weaker that means you can buy less stuff or your dollars don't do as far that's one of the reasons why two thousand eight felt so bad you had money but that money could buy as much stuff as it used to and if we're if we're on the verge of doing that again we're kind of part way down this path\nThat you can use them for X strategies to protect your assets and so you know we have students that whole currency knows FDIC insured um us based bank where you're allowed to hold foreign currency\nUm had been ever bank and now it's TI a bank and so ... it gives you some strategies where you can protect it in case of dollar goes down you can hold have exposure to other currencies you can also use the spot for X market\nWhich allows you to control large pieces of the market plunge pieces of of um currency\nAnd do it in a way where you know you get the benefit if the dollar goes down and so these are strategies that you can use that again if it's outside the norm\nBut if in what what is the attraction to being average or below average I mean really what the financial services people are selling you is the opportunity for below average returns\nAnd if you want to be below average keeping below average that's fine if you want to break free from being below average you need to start thinking about things differently and start understanding where the opportunities are\nIn the market and how you can you know with a little bit of time a little bit of knowledge you can start doing things safer and smarter than what you're currently doing\nAnd so for preservation strategies we have some students that use the for X. market so they'll have buying power purchasing power parity\nIs the fancy term for it but the idea is that it's a dollar goes up you're making money anyway the dollar goes down you should have at least a strategy to protect yourself in that event\nAnd so another strategy other students user using options and certainly for future income you know we have a program focused on using selling options to generate income and a safer smarter way in a way to get more consistent returns\nWell we can do the same thing in our preservation strategy and we can target a lower return sunset of targeting you know eight ten twelve percent\nWe can use similar strategies amusing cast secured puts using covered calls income asset allocation and use those four to generate you know three four five percent\nThan by doing that you're taking less risk on to get the same or better return than what you're currently doing and from a financial perspective that's good financial management\nAnd so if you're interested in learning how to preserve what you've got but do it in a safer smarter way for a lot of our students options are great way to do that\nAnd then we have a program called the mastermind community where every day we're identifying safe place to sell your options across a number of each ts and some students do it every week some students do it every month it's a peasant how involved you want to be with your money\nBut the idea is if you're involved in a safer smarter way then you have more say in the ... returns you're getting\nAnother great preservation strategy is real estate so we have a number of students that you know use the financial markets to generate current income they use the financial markets to generate their future income but then they use real estate as a way of preserving their assets\nAnd the real estate and generally gets about six percent return over time\nAnd it has will Rogers said you know they're not making any more so there's if if you're ...\nThat return over time and yeah as will Rogers said you know they're not making any more so there's if if you find yourself looking for the right type of market so part of what you have to do is look for\nMarkets that are projecting growth over the next ten twenty Thirty years and the bureau of Labor Statistics provides these population studies and so if you take a look at North Carolina\nTake a look at the Georgia Florida Texas you know these are areas that are slated to continue to grow Tennessee those opportunities there and then you have to take into account the whole hurricane risk that probably takes taxes to North Carolina and Florida out\nBut there's opportunities in Georgia Tennessee where you can basically I expose yourself to growing markets are going to have increased demand\nUsing some real estate strategies that are designed to provide you with some tax benefits as well as preserve your money\nAnd Don Dawson is one of our local instructors and he's been trading on his own since Nineteen eighty seven and he's been instructor about ten years and he told me that every time he teaches a class he learned something from a student that helps them become a better trader\nI Would agree with that yeah there's a number of\nStudents and we always talk about some of the great success stories and there's a number of them with with on like trade academy you know given the way that we teach our classes and the content in the end the into the professionalism of the instructors so yeah there's a number of things that that go well there and uh yeah I'd say after\nListening to a lot of the traders and I've had a number of them come back this week which has been very rewarding but yeah they take what you see on them and they they incorporate into their trade plans and to hear their success stories on time and time again it's it's very rewarding and again it's one of the benefits of getting to do what I Do\nSort of your students bring you an apple or what are the rewards do you get from your students you know it's almost like he walked into the room today which I Know you didn't do but there are literally\nTwo apples on my desk as you speak so that is very very funny that you actually say that but um you know I'll tell you what a really cool story on a on a on a on another level of that though as far as gifts says I'm I'm not a I was never in the military but this gentleman and his name as tennis from Arizona and like I say is a great guy but he's the guy that came into the Baltimore class\nYou know a few months back and I met originally in Phoenix but\nHe pulled me aside in in the Baltimore class a few months ago when we were in uh we were in\nAnd he he he literally I almost broke down and we're talking about a really tough guys like I said in special forces um military fantastic guy but he gave me I'm a metal on\nThat's representative of of the military and uh and taught me a couple of things about how to you know how to use it and some of the language that they use but that to me it was and I still have the course and I keep it with me and my and my dad got to travel with him but that was a really cool thing to have 'em and like I said I have it all the time so that was one of the more memorable guessed that I have received from someone\nThat's great and in this area we have students that from all branches of the military we have enlisted way of officers and we find is that you know the folks that can follow a standard operating procedure the folks that\nCare about their results the folks that can be disciplined enough to follow the things that you lay out are the ones that can do well and that's where\nThe military folks often our best students no\nQuestion about it and I we see a lot of them as you say here in Washington DC a lot in Baltimore on actually I did a class in Kansas City a couple of weeks ago and almost the entire class was military or ex military\nAnd you're right the the language which was with which they speak the uh\nThe rules the way they fall on the discipline or it doesn't make it 'cause that's what trading is all about you got to be able to follow a plan um realize that it's not going to be perfect every time there's going to be losses but how you manage those losses and how you follow your plan is really going to determine whether or not you're successful in this business so yeah I'm a military ex military\nUh certainly great candidates for for high end successful level traders\nAnd we we had a a student from he was a ... he was wounded in Afghanistan severe pie TST can only focus for about Fifteen minutes at a time\nAnd he went through the course strategy class and they did the trading contest and sure enough at the end of the day and one bomb that's awesome and and the instructor said well and you can only focus for Fifteen minutes how can you do this he said I just follow the rules\nThat great yeah ... it's phenomenal yeah I Love it and that is so true you know when the laser it with the rules are laid out the right way and then followed I think that's the only thing we got to remember um yeah it's all it's all set up there for you to be successful and that's why people come to us the way they do which is which is great\nAnd part of it is transforming lives central to our mission how many lives have you transformed as an online training academy instructor over your ten years\nWhile yeah Chris great question I I I don't have an answer that but I Know the classes are are are bigger and bigger all

of your friends and they're\nTo the do yourself investors show and I really appreciate Jerry Suzie as them and that seemed to see as a matter instructors bring to our students every day and that's part of the power of being part of a global education community\nPlace it's focused on\nWorking together building an education community of like minded people that are focused on doing better for their current income\nDoing better for their future income and preserving what they've got and so today we're walking through what a\nSuccess plan looks like for do yourself investors and how online trade academy works for their students to help you develop that success plan and then once we have the overall goals of what you're trying to accomplish and why then we're going to help you identify some preservation strategies\nThat are not these wacky Hi fi high risk strategies at the financial services people have you take\nBut things where we can take you out of the market risk give you the opportunity to generate similar return\nBut do it in a way where you are in control and you're not paying someone for the privilege of them losing money and what you're doing is you're able to hurricane the fees and expenses yourself\nBecause you're not generating high fees you're not generating high expenses you get to keep those in your pocket and that improves your overall peace of mind that improves your ability to sleep at night\nAnd haven't preservation strategies that are designed to make you money as opposed to someone else and that's the foundation for your overall success planned and at the end of the day you know as a and one of the things that we know is that people you know you're wealthy if you're listening to show your one of the wealthiest people in the world\nBut you don't feel wealthy because\nYou've been told to be afraid of the future you been told that bad things are going to happen to you and if you're unprepared if you're on the educated then yeah you're going to be taken advantage of\nAnd what we want you to do is be able to understand how the market really works and we're opportunities are to protect yourself\nAnd that's going to give yourself just a better way to protect could move forward in the world\nAnd so real simple you know in the market you know you've heard you have to buy low and sell high well ask yourself this do you have a system\nFor identifying where is the buy low and do you have a system that will help you identify where is the cell high opportunity because real simple you know businesses make money by buying it wholesale and selling retail whether that's Wal Mart or Pasco yeah wherever you go\nEvery business has a strategy to buy low and sell higher\nAnd unfortunately for most people in their financial world they're not doing that and they don't have a system they don't have a way to read today's volatile markets you know things are going up and down every day and most people look at that and they have no idea what's going on do you think\nYou know things are going up and down every day and most people look at that and they have no idea what's going on do you think you'd be able to get better returns safer returns if you understood how the market's really work\nAnd that's part of given getting yourself educated and then learning a system that's designed to make it easier for you to make money\nAnd control your risk while that's happening and so you have to be successful do it yourself investor first you have to protect what you've got\nThen you've got to be able to position where you've got the third you have to profit from what you've got and so part of our success plan you know the focus on building the foundation affirmed foundation of preservation that's where you learn how to protect what you've got and in some markets teams up you\nKnow you don't want to keep buying as the market goes up you want to be taking some money off the table and positioning yourself to take advantage of other opportunities as they arise and so I was talking to my cousin and a few weeks ago\n\nDid you just look down on your phone [noise] he did it again then you know you find down

pronged strategy for which there's a roll out of a new one that I'm sure it's been pre determined week to week there will be two new allegations of this or that we will next you know focus on his taxes to Russia collusion fades away despite all that organizing he's still got elected Kavanaugh still got seated\nAnd I'm Wondering if there might be some wariness or some fatigue on the part of\nThose of us are trying to influence with the money in these tactics were where we stop listening or we stop being has moved even by the need to accusation um especially as there are allegations of wrongly accused coming forward or hypocritical political application of the need to\nUm allegations I think all of this could you know sort of boomerang back\nBefore I ask you about tomorrow's show um you know they're already clamoring that he has to recuse himself for anything that comes up because of what he said about Clinton and Democrats on the on the panel and what goes around comes around\nBut just the other day addressing over right before the the hearings\nAre the second round of hearings I'm Ruth Bader Ginsburg expressed her support for the me too movement so a ... by

could take this and carry it to you know to it's absurd\nWell the problem is as we know a lot of these standards are not equally apply there wouldn't be such an issue if they were and it's what you and I talked about on the path that I call the substitution game certain standards of of conduct and ethics in behavior are applied to one side but not necessarily the other\nWith similar circumstances so um I think your argument made made the logical but I don't think we'll always see logical application of these things but I tend to think there may be other battle to be fought once he's on the Supreme Court\nOn that so be sworn in tune 'em you know there's not a whole lot they can do and they may have bigger fight the fight on their hand plus the realization that I heard a quote someone gave the other day that um\nYou know some women's rights movement for saying lend Souter was being confirmed that women will die if he's confirmed I mean many of the same arguments were made and of course that hasn't happened even though these are intimate each time not to a lot to say this will never happen but just that\nAgain is there an element of a little bit of crying wolf is\nSky is falling each time a nomination goes through that that side doesn't like and yet no giant disaster happen\nBride no absolutely and let me ask you one more because you've been around knew you were in

it to me I assume they go through metal detectors before they get a new buildings and to correct me if I'm wrong but then there are allowed to wander around and just get in the face of any US Senators the ... I don't know how does that happen\nWhile the obviously the metal detector is on a day when there is a public vote members of the public are allowed in so your check for guns and you know contraband that check your id isn't checked in terms of who you are\nAnd then ... once you get inside their our elevators that the public takes that are right next to the elevators and their wealth of the members of Congress that are reserved for them explicitly now we sometimes in the press\nKind of chase them or walk with them right up to the elevator and if they invite you on as a member of the ... maybe even a member of the public I don't know you can sneak on with them if you're doing an interview by you're not allowed to go on that yourself you're not allowed to hound them and follow them but I guess security hasn't been\nTight enough to to keep them you know secure in that situation because that sort of activity is is not allowed at that part of the Capitol building\nI I I thought so and and I do a lot I got one more before your show a question um I'd be remiss the again I Know you're not a political commentator but that's all I'll put it this way how his to review the speech on the floor of the Senate given by Susan Collins yesterday\nI Would say if if she were running for president which I've never heard she wants to do that sort of lays it all out as a a thoughtful deliberative legislate tore it kind of surprised me too 'cause I don't follow these things\nThat sort of lays it all out as a\nA thoughtful deliberative legislate tore on it kind of surprised me too 'cause I don't follow these things terribly closely but I did let me ... and they out you guys play the whole H I was in my car and she really did conduct what what sounded like a fair and deliver the process that you would hope both sides would\nBe conducting or something that's important and I think that was a probably a third of the defining speech as long as it was it's not like it's going to be repeated and played over and over again but I think it will be remembered for what you said in a time where it seems like there's a lot of ... screening it was a on very deliberative speech\nAnd ... do you see that Susan Rice is talking now about running against her ... up in Maine\nNow I didn't see that how how interesting race would that be\nOr that that kind of defined where we are you know both sides and the Democrat Party and the Republican Party in a way\nYeah All right so what can we look forward to tomorrow on a on full measure\nBob this is a fascinating story about a cover story and eat waste recycler\nMeaning he's pushing to recycle all the toxic computers and found that go into Atlanta poisoning us with mercury in other countries were poisonous foreigners\nAnyway he hated it it's like to recycling and ended up costing crossing pass with Microsoft which I thought he would robbing the new sales of new computers and this is an incredible story of how\nArmed guards then rate it at home um arrested him and he says prosecutors told them that Microsoft wanted it had on a pattern that we're going to get a job so I did that last interview with a guy before he was sent off to federal prison that's recycler and I think it's an incredible story that people were like\nWow that yeah yeah no that that\nThat's a great great tease because it is a great story a show where the long have you add a grant make again I Hope and thank you very much\nFor it [laughter] okay Cheryl I could see ladies and gentlemen I'm so measure Sinclair is full measure Sheryl is the host of course\nAnd um she is just a she she's been through it all you probably know her story and her very very much a very interesting conversation\nAnd we'll get back and we'll take your calls Steven David and telling me and everybody else weighing in eight eight eight six thirty WMA yell eight eight eight six thirty nine six\nTwo five seed miles but we're live just a less than an hour after the a confirmation in the Senate of justice or soon to be sworn in a associate justice of the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh here on W.
