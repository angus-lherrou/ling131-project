B. I. by the DNC and by the Clinton campaign I don't know\nBut one of one of those two things is the truth\nThat's what I Do know or he is either an agent of the Russian government is ... ... who was a directed to do treasonous acts against this nation and disrupting our democratic process during the twenty sixteen presidential election on behalf of ... possibly in coordination with the Trump campaign\nOr she is an innocent man in the center of quite possibly the biggest political scandal in American history\nWhere she an innocent American was a used abused lied about and then surveilled spied on a intruded upon publicly smeared publicly slide\nFor political purposes to help the Hillary Clinton campaign and or to harm\nPresident Trump's administration it can't be both an can't me neither it's one or the other but as I continue to listen to that interview from yesterday and I beg you to do the same you can find it at our website ... dot com I I'm taken by a couple of things here if he is an agent of the Russian government [noise]\nWhy would invite the scrutiny why would he voluntarily use the court system in America to open up discovery\nTo open up the process where every aspect of his life can be a looked into pure into scrutinized and held up to that reasonable doubt question of whether he in fact is an agent of the Russian government the very best defense for the dmc\nAnd the law firm named in this defamation suit as to say well listen we didn't defame him because he is an agent of the Russian government and they can prove that\nBut why would he do that if it were true\nAlso bought last time I checked whatever ... kind of a thug you know if you cross him if you threaten to expose him if you got on the wrong side of him if you do something that's gonna be damaging to him\nLast time I checked whatever ... kind of a thug you know if you cross him if you threaten to expose him if you got on the wrong side of him if you do something that's gonna be damaging to him you die an ugly painful death why would Carter Page invite that too [noise]\nI don't know one way or the other I don't have the facts I Know this Carter Page has never been charged with a crime\n... after a full\nYear walk up the most intense scrutiny by the FBI and the Justice Department\nAnd Carter Page is acting like an innocent man and worse and more dangerous for the DNC and the Hillary Clinton campaign and their lawyers he is acting like an innocent man who is bound and determined to get the truth out there and get mentioned [noise] watch that re Carter Page may end up being\nAnd uh what let me tell me about your success in the business world specifically and what kind of business as you've been involved in\nIt for different businesses most successful one was when I started in two thousand and two called high line it was an investment management business ended up selling it in two thousand and Fifteen and then they became the c._e._o. the company that I sold it to and it was about a six and a half billion dollar investment management business we employed about a hundred people like to say it was already Sanders\nWould not like you don't have you get into the Senate Bernie's at all it's one of those guys one of those high finance guys ruining our country\nUm hopefully I can make friends with Bernie Sanders our friends across the highway at I'm Kevin I'm not I'm not his um his type of candidate I Do embraced capitalism and I on on a shamed capitalist I Believe in the power of the private sector that\nThe power of a good job for someone in how many societies problems that that solves you have a good job you have an income you have health care he got a place to go get a sense of purpose it'd be nice if the people around you and I am really proud of the jobs they've created and I think that that's an important part of\nAmerica's path forward is preparing for high paying jobs so as an independent but I got to tell you I\nInterviewed Tony Campbell a couple of times he's said almost the same thing a former U.S army Chaplin running as a Republican or I mean how do you defer from him other than the label\nSo I think there are a lot of difference first of all if you really want to see the differences watched the debate I encourage your listeners to watch the debate it's been televised four times and it's available on Fox Baltimore dot com and also on CSPAN and you'll get a a good sense of it but I I think I have a very different background than Tony Campbell I'm a private sector person who's run a number of\nBusinesses I'm the only candidate in this race that has created jobs managed people\nI'm paid for health care for many many people I'm Tony him I think is a professor at a thousand so we've got very different backgrounds and politically if you want to talk about different issues are at their their differences as well I don't know where he stands on on everything\nWell All right well I've been ... we can start with some of the hot button issues right now if you're in the U.S Senate right now what's your response to what's going on in Saudi Arabia and the columnist from the Washington Post who apparently was killed if you were on armed services that you have a voice what would you say\nI think right now that's an example of an issue where people jumping to the debate and they take one side or another and so much of it is based on their part is in viewpoint and\nCar and by the way is the first person to jump into these things he loves going on CNN he's right there with Schumer is talking point\nOne of the things I gave him a hard time with that is when he's on CNN it's almost always talking about foreign policy it's not talking about Maryland and helping people in Maryland get ahead and not talking about Baltimore where he's from and he's represented for fifty two years and we've watched Baltimore declined over his time in office I think we got to wait and see the facts like we do on on ... on a lot of\nThings are the other of foreign policy issue but definitely does affect people in Maryland with regard to illegal immigration is this a migrant train of Hondurans who are coming up uh Mexico presidents today threatened to deploy the armed services or the U.S military to protect the border would you support the president's move\nSo I support additional border security period we have about a half to a wall it so I my opinion is a wall is probably not the best use of the money I'm find spending the money that that would cost ON Technology on manpower\nTo me a while feels a little bit like in Nineteen centuries solution to a twenty first century problem\nBut whatever the experts say the best way to protect our border I'm In favor of we have about a half a million illegal immigrants here come into this country while there are millions of people waiting all around the world and that's not fair to those people waiting it might is an issue close to my heart my mother's an immigrant my grandparents were all immigrants\nAnd I think we need to secure our border and get that number way way down hopefully as close to zero as we can what about the illegal immigrants who are here in this country so I I think once you have a secure border then you can start to do things like create I think we have a path to citizenship for people who\nCame as children and have been here for decades and are law abiding and pay taxes\nI don't think it's realistic to think that we're going to deport millions and millions of people\nWe've got ... million people in this country who are undocumented ... the overwhelming majority of them are law abiding and pay taxes and work really hard\nWe've got ... million people in this country who are undocumented ... the overwhelming majority of them are law abiding and pay taxes and worked really hard and I think we should entertained some kinda\nPath I think if you go to the back of the line but you can't the thing the Democrats need to understand is you can't do that unless you have a secure border otherwise you're just inviting lots of people to come across the board\nJust to clarify they need to go back on the line but they go to the back of wind here in America then joined the benefits of our country they don't go to the back of the line in their in their country of origin\nI I don't think it's practical and maybe you have a plan to deport twelve million people that I don't think that's really one at a time\nYou know a bit but let me ask you this because I'm always confused by this I hear this a lot from people who want the path to citizenship and ah and I'm open to the discussion but when you say there are law abiding and they pay their taxes how was that possible\nHow are they paying taxes because if they're paying taxes means they have a job right I mean a lot of them do have jobs Jeff how are they working\nIf they are law abiding because if they're working they're using fake documents [noise]\nUm I think a lot of them do get jobs without documents right so I favor of that would be a guideline over that is true so they're not law abiding now so the penalty thing but I I I favor nationalizing the verify program which would dramatically reduce what you're talking about now I ... so I favor that I favor additional but if you\nDo that then there's a bunch of undocumented people who can't get jobs and so now what do we do with them\nDoing now you're reducing the incentive for people to cross the border illegally that the reason people come to this country is because they want those jobs most people are not coming here to commit crimes are coming here because they want to work hard and send money back to their families in poor countries that were really difficult situations\nWere speaking to know Simon here the independent candidate for Senate in the state of Maryland what's your biggest beef with Ben cart and right now that it's always funny how people the kind of give Ben card in the past solve a lot of stuff you sort of like this are seen as this a wise statesman for the Democratic party or what what where does where's been cartoon gone wrong\nWell I think in general he's not gotten much done for the people in Maryland on almost any issue that you can come\nSo you can look at and for me I care a lot about business issues and fiscal issues ran I Am a pro business candidate fiscally conservative candidate and I think Ben Cardin it's zero rating from the chamber of commerce I'm not sure he has seen a tax or regulation that he has supported\nSo on issues like that I take the other side just for example in the last few months that we have this scaling back of Dodd Frank for example I Would have I I Would have voted in favor of the scaling back of Dodd Frank and in fact I think a handful of Democrats did handful Democrats that but bank toward and voted with the liberal part of the Democratic party against that\nYeah ah well of course because is there anything that he hasn't voted with structure and he really does is a pretty reliable vote for Chuck Schumer he is arguably\nThe most reliable we put up a website called harden follows dot com your listeners can go check it out cordon follows dot com he votes with Chuck Schumer Ninety seven percent of the time and you can see the stats on each in the last year on the last few years on our website\nAnd that contributes to this partisan brawl that so many people in this country are just tired of\nThe answer to our country's problems is not party line voting by both parties and each\nSide screaming louder and louder at each other and nothing's getting done we're in a stalemate on not just the immigration that you brought up but on reducing our health care costs than investing and infrastructure on\nUm reducing gun violence on reducing our dead\nWearing a stalemate and yeah well\nA big reason for the soul mate is because there's a whole lot of politics in resisting what the president's agenda is uh did you vote support president Donald Trump or who did you support the president that look I did not vote\nFor President Trump um budget mattered islands and I'm not against every single thing that President Trump has done and I can give examples of of things that I support and I think\nThe same way it was wrong when Mitch McConnell said we're going to obstruct everything that Iraq Obama is going to try to do as president it is wrong for the Democrats to say on there and tried to resist as their word every single thing that President Trump does neither one is right\nOur country needs to focus on finding common ground in actually trying to get things done on the issues with our common ground\nI take it you did vote for Hillary Clinton I did so and then I get that out I have to tell you\nThat I did it reluctantly I wasn't really happy with either my choice\nI hearing it on and and I hear that from a lot of people and I don't necessarily quarrel with people who who went the other way but here's the question if you had that vote to knowing now what you know based on how President Trump has led and the issues that he's been able to move forward if you had to vote today would you cast the same boat\n[noise] I wouldn't vote for President Trump and again I'm not a yeah every single thing he's done but to me that my my biggest concern is the impact that we're having on the next generation we have a generation of children growing up watching leaders who lie who be little who attack anyone who's critical of them\nWho bully and I grew up in a day and age where my presence for Jimmy Carter\nLie who'd be little who attack anyone who's critical of them who bully and I grew up in a day and age where my presidents Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan\nVery different politically but we all trusted them that they have the country's best interests in mind we respected them in the way that they behave and the behavior that they modeled for our children\nAnd I just worry about we got a generation of kids growing up that are looking at behavior that they are going to model down the road and I think we're all going to live to regret it well but again it's not all him I don't want to put all the blame on him it is it is all over Capitol Hill and that's part of why I'm running\nSo I I and I listen I get at the Donald Trump is not on the ballot and and your argument against President Trump appears to be his behavior of his personality his is the things that he says the the way he says I'm On the issues\nAnd was on and I was wondering

now that they\nHave given the composition Supreme Court which is now more conservative on this issue that is that in decades at night outside around classical\nLet's get to that potential and game in a moment I'm fascinated by this uh the allegation in this claim that that Harvard\nUh drew the line on a certain number of Asians are Asian Americans because they had enough already ... was there any stated policy of Harvard that that they're pointing to where they just looking at the numbers and making that terminology\nNumbers and there's a document that you can't read between the lines and the
