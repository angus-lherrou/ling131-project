the president and by the\nLeadership in the Republican Party in the United States Senate he was not forgotten he was not forsaken he was not for under the bus for political expediency and God Knows uh many smart people in this town\nA conservative well Republican and Democrat political pundits I saw them all on cable I saw them on social media I read the columns they were all quite sure\nThat probably it was just best now to abandon us fight and get another nominee forward because they didn't think of Brett Kavanaugh the human being they thought about political expediency\nAnd isn't it nice to see a little integrity in this town when some people stood up and did the right things for the right reasons uh Brett Kavanaugh deserved that\nYou and I deserved that our political process deserved to that and we got to take a moment considering the mock that we have to dwell in on a daily basis around here we have to take a moment and and step back and admire that fact as it doesn't

right the only thing that makes it makes sense as if you realize that the politics is a big money business\nAnd and the things that these guys do and the way that they do it is is often times just meant to prove to the deep pocketed special interest groups\nThat have a whole lot of money and they throw them at their party and they throw them at their causes and they throw that money at their campaign a lot of the things that they do and say and posture about is just to prove to them that their money as well spent that they're getting something for all that money and they they they knew\nThat it was going to take everything to throw at this thing to make it look like they were ... they they they can at least go back to them and say listen\nWe did everything possible to try to stop this thing they just had one more vote than we did that's why you gotta give us even more money to get more seats in the Senate but when you when you think about it in that context and recognize
