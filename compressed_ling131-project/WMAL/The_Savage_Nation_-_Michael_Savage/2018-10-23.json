Democrats resisted government health care for all and and free jobs and and college education which nobody knows how to pay for\nIf we can come up with continue to focus on the economy on securing our

go up and down the aisle for court or selling that to moderate voters who typically decide elections in in Florida that socialism is the answer for their state\nThen look for you to turn a little bit to the uh the caravan issue here I'm calling to carry a man that can be a ... we've got thousands of people who are demanding entry into our country and they're they're charging across Mexico first of all is there any\nHope here that we can use our diplomatic efforts to get in Mexico to solve this problem I see it as a Mexico problem this is happening in their country shouldn't they step up and the international community step up to do something about this\nAnd I think we are starting to see Mexico take a stronger to lead in this area uh but as we saw they actually toward out offensive or climbing over the fact that the border security in Mexico from Guatemala to get there and the first place\nI Know the Mexican government is trying to deter them try to push them back or whether they will ultimately be successful you know I Know we're working hand and foot with them right now on that\nBut it it's going to eventually get to the U.S border and that's where the president has been very clear he will bring out the military and ... and activate the border than customs patrol to stop people from coming into this country illegally it's not that we don't want refugees\nBut we need a legitimate refugees coming through the system legally\nMaking their claim and not just trying to hop the border and make the claim after they've been caught\nTen more clutter what's really happening there because uh you know thousands of people don't just spontaneously decide hey I'm gonna walk of Nineteen hundred miles to the American border\nThis is obviously an organized activity and yet I don't see any journalist even asking those questions where where's the money coming from who's actually ... and by the way aren't they like hopping on the trucks and driving part of the way there's no way they are all walking the systems completely\nThere are a lot of questions there that need to be answered who's funding them we have seen reporting that they're basically hopping on trucks and buses and only walking when the media\nWhen the cameras are there exactly\nYou know here's the bigger thing that's gone and very much a notice you had the president of Guatemala go into their largest newspaper in that country in recent days confirming that they have apprehended one hundred ISIS members in Guatemala\nWe don't know who's in this ... this migrant caravan we don't know we know it\nOriginated from El Salvador Nicaragua and Guatemala but who's there what are they trying to do when they tried to enter our country and those are the question of why we need to have strong border security and then close the loop holes that allow people to come in\nAnd then just get ushered into the middle of the country with the hopes that\nAnd to have strong borders of purity and then close the loop holes that allow people to come in and then just get ushered into the middle of the country with the hopes that they'll return for their hearing in two or three years\nYeah so you said that the president is going to call it the military and we're going to have a showdown at the border how does that play out exactly and and that it politically or listen to we have every right to enforce our borders I get that\nPolitically is it the the best thing for us to utilize the military against thousands of unarmed people who\nWho have wrongly been promised that as long as they come to our border and claim asylum there'll be there'll be allowed entry well\nI think we need to differentiate too between using the military and what I Would consider using military force or defending with with individuals who are members of the military but I don't think we're going to be getting in to you know kind of like drawn battle lines\nOkay the Rio Grande great then explain what it does it because I heard a lot of people say the president called the military and they'll protect the border will play that out for me what does that look like\nI think most likely end of all you know members of the military customs and border patrol National Guard and ever and detaining anyone that they can actually catch trying to cross the border illegally and if possible sending them back to their country of origin\nOr getting into that position where uh where they can be processed through whatever claim they might have but the end of the line is you cannot cross into our country illegally\nAll right so and again sadly because of the policies that are still in place that Congress has not been able to overturn or or have had not have the\nWill to overturn if we detain people as they cross the border illegally we know what happens there mark they claim asylum they get their hearing date and then they disappear\nThat's one of the reasons why if anything this needs to shine a bright light on the failures of are proud of our immigration laws let's remember that\nTwenty years ago Thirty years ago\nMigrants coming into our country or Ninety percent Mexican they were Ninety percent men seeking jobs economic I dropped opportunity right now is more than half are coming from Central America\nAnd there including family in it because they know that if you have a child or a family with you our law does not allow you to send them back to Central America we've got a house of them can't house them for more than twenty days and then we're at the end of the middle of the country and hope they show up in a couple of years\nIt it's just not workable system and that's why the president's been very clear that the laws of ...\nMellon ultimately I Do think that those issues do play well politically all these things we have to you know this is a humanitarian issue this is a human issue but it's also a political issue everything is and uh if things continue the way they are with the story out of Mexico do you think that that ... ends up helping Republicans ... two weeks from now\nI think the initial the initial push in\nTerms of making sure our borders are secured will help Republicans\nBut I think the longer this goes on as we saw with ... you know going on last year or earlier this year\nYou know it it has a chance to change but ultimately what the president is saying is if Democrats and Republicans can come together he'll make a deal with them but we've got to close the loop hole and we have to make sure that our immigration laws reflect the problems of today not the problems of decades ago\nMan and the fact that Democrats have not been willing to sit and have any kind of conversation uh to to come to find some middle ground tells you that I I think they think this place politically or in their favor\nUm which is a rather despicable place for them to or we will leave it there I appreciate you joining us as always mark ... uh two weeks to go you want to make a prediction uh overall\nUh I'll make a prediction is that the Senate gained three seats in the Senate\nRepublicans gained three seats for the Senate and I think we control the house Republicans it'll

president we just finished with Anthony Scaramucci I've gotten their take on the political scene and specifically about what's going to happen in the mid term\nWe're going to do we want to check in with as many of our favorite Democrats as possible we're going to get Dennis Kucinich on here in the next couple of weeks maybe Joe trip B maybe my old friend Simon Rosenberg\nFrom Fox News but it's\nComing up in the five o'clock hour Leslie Marshall who is a liberal Democrat political analyst I'm On Fox News often with her we're going to get her take a A R she's still confidence that there's going to be a blue wave and by the way if not why not [noise] ...\nGood lord I my God if the Democrats can't win two weeks from now they're never going to win they have everything working in their favor in terms of the media in terms of the narrative in terms of the hysterics [noise] uh let's see Marshall coming up in the five o'clock hour I Want to focus on a story\nThat is happening right here in this area Montgomery County in particular a this coming from but says the magazine but it's from research done by ProPublica has done analysis of\nAll of the school district here in this area and other major metropolitan areas around the country uh they've analyzed the data with regard to Montgomery County public schools the disciplinary\nActions and their uh grading\nPerformance with regard to racial disparities here [noise] uh and the headline is data shows minority students in Montgomery County public schools are more likely to be disciplined and behind academically\nAnd it is incredibly damning in the twenty Fifteen twenty six teams school you're forty six percent of Montgomery County public schools out of school suspensions were charged to black students forty six percent\nThirty one percent were given to Hispanic so that means Seventy seven percent of these suspensions where you they suspend you out of school suspension is not a detention out of school suspension Seventy seven percent went to a member of a either a black minority group or Latino minority group\nA meanwhile uh blacks only account for Twenty one percent of the actual school population Hispanics twenty nine percent [noise]\nUm whites by the way make up thirty percent of Montgomery County public schools\nA further more white students only accounted for twelve percent of the suspensions with the remainder going to Asian students are students of two or more racist get this of all the expulsions of students in Montgomery County in the twenty Fifteen twenty sixteen school year\nOnly Hispanic and black students were expelled from Montgomery County public schools no white students were expelled at all [noise]\nNow this is all data this is all statistics oh by the way a one other thing black students or an Hispanic students about three grades behind white students in Montgomery County academically now what's fascinating to me about this is the response of Montgomery County schools\nSchool officials don't argue there is racial disparity in student discipline and achievement butter quit the strategies implemented in recent years to improve\nOver the past few years I'm CPS has emphasized district wide staff training explaining cultural proficiency an implicit bias\nAt a press conference earlier this month and CPS director of equity initiatives Troy body outlined the training and said it will continue this year with a session aimed at interrupting implicit bias now let's just think about this logically\nBe or what they're saying here and the government county schools is and we've asked them to come on we do want to have a conversation with the elected officials if not we'll go with one of their flags\nThey're saying that either white kids are doing really bad things but the teachers because of implicit bias aren't calling him on it and aren't suspending them even though they're doing bad stuff\nOr they're saying the black and Latino kids really do it\nAren't calling him on it and aren't suspending them even though they're doing bad stuff\nOr they're saying the black and Latino kids are really doing bad things but the teachers are punishing them even though they don't deserve it [noise] right [noise]\nUh well I guess that's it it's got to be one or the other either they're letting the white kids get away with murder and they're not doing anything about it or they're being unfair to the black and Hispanic\nKids [noise] what think about this for a minute across the board and Montgomery County at every level of political makeup is the most liberal Democrat leadership you can find and yet they are overseeing\nWhat can only be described as a racist public school system shocking for twenty four on\nWBAL high I'm Patrick singles tone
