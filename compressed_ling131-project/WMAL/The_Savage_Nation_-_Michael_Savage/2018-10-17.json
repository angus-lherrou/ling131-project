A. Mr paid doctor page I should say thank you for joining us\nGreat to be with you you know that but what do they how come they don't refer to as Dr Carter Page you have a PHD just like Dr Christine Blasey Ford she's Dr Ford everywhere you should demand to be Dr page\nYou know it's funny Larry there so there is a interesting court battle related to that [laughter]\nSo in my uh and all my filing in the southern district of New York the U.S federal court in downtown yeah the I don't know if you know but the U.S department of justice represent any federal agency and you know I I've been in litigation battle with the broadcasting board of governors\nAnd so you know it's a I'm a ... typically in court filings I'm dressed as Dr page okay for the OJ they just\nStick the word page in there they just called me page very yeah so now they don't even have a mixture and there's a a there is a great quote I'll Try to dig it up for you um ... while we're talking yeah or the FBI they they said\nBack when they were wiretapping Martin Luther king junior yeah they said we're not going to address you by Dr ... are not that I mean it was a very you know a a a spiteful\n... very yeah things are\nFew by Dr her or not that I mean it was a very you know a a a spiteful\nDoes lend missed two very good yeah things are well there goes your right up there with them okay junior ...\nHour they say that I think tactics\nYeah ... ... you know it is I mean people people think that this is some kind of news story to suggest that there could have been abuses in corruption at the FBI but you're absolutely right to point that out a a let's get to your lawsuit I you know when we had you on last a bunch of people reached out via email and Twitter social media\nOr do they really enjoyed our interview and they said why isn't Carter Page suing their you know he should be going out there and so now you are you filed a lawsuit this week tell us the details [noise] well\nFor ah you know what they did and so show me the documents and I you know that I'll answer your question\nBut you did testify and you have not been charged with perjury in fact you haven't been charged with a with anything ... to the states I Would love your reaction known what what you make of the fact that you the guy they said was the agents of the Russian government who was trying to help overthrow the election\nYou answered every question under oath Glenn Simpson he's just the guy who you know did the job of uncovering all these horrible things are in creating the CIA ... what do you make of that\nWell I mean I I think what we've seen consistently Larry is they've just been trying to you know cover up for what [noise] what happened right and I think you know step by step uh it's it's only damaging them right because\nUm the longer this this goes on you know sooner or later it's going to be out in the public you know it's um it's it's unfortunate because it's doing a lot of damage to our country on on many levels I agree you know again that's that's part of the whole\nMotivation to begin with right they wanna do damage so I mean that's the whole point of and operate opposition research a project to begin with\nUm I Know you have to run and my last question for you Carter Page listen this is a deep pocketed law firm and they're a D.C law firm uh they they work in politics\nI bet they want us to go away or if they offer you a settlement will you take it or were you bound and determined to have this all come to light and half your day in court\nI Would I Would really like to have my day in court Larry but again I'm I'm open minded and I'm always uh you know we'll have to see what happens you know what I was well it's interesting in my uh other case uh the with\nUh the you know the original publishers in terms of the media outlets both the U.S government propaganda agency are funded by the broadcasting board of governors\nAs well as the the oath which is the owner of Yahoo News and horizon or sorry I'm a Huffington Post\nThey they both the lawyers for the private companies they were literally very um they've actually been much more open and yeah\nA cooperative in terms of you know some of the the ... and our our interactions and that court case\nComparatively speaking to U.S Department of justice has been very obstructive you know I think uh the OJ has essentially handled my case there the way they've been handling their interactions with Congress\nWho's who's also been trying to get to the bottom of this dodgy ... a fiasco which created this whole a mess for him to begin with so we'll see what happens you know it's it's very early days that just just filed the case a couple of days ago and um you know I'm I'm hopeful that this private law firm and this\nOrganization the DNC will uh will be a follow in the footsteps of um you know some of the media companies who are who have been relatively more\nA straightforward in terms of their behavior a relative to the OJ which I think you know what's really interesting Larry we'll have to see what comes out there but there's a lot of pressure and uh I think eventually the damn that's about to bust so a lot of these problems and questions might solve themselves well\nThat's what we want to go up and I know that's what you want to clear your name and to get to the bottom of all of this and expose these people that's what we want to and I appreciate your joining us and thank you for\nPersevering through this and thank you for filing a lawsuit because I think that will help move the ball down

hear from you\nHow is your life been better since election day because I'm not seeing any coverage in the mainstream media about [noise] undeniably phenomenal economic conditions in this country right now so if they're not going to cover it you are give us a call ... six zero nine six two five how was your life better since election day\nRight before twenty six teams election where all they're doing is looking at the the the sentiment an attitude in Los Angeles and in New York and in DC\nYou know all of their pals who are already liberal Democrats so they're just they're just an echo chamber for all of their friends and all of their parties and and at the soccer games that they go to their ignoring people in the middle of the country\nAnd they're looking at the polls the the political coverage that we see right now is exactly the same as we saw right before the twenty six team president's election where all they're doing is talking about polls and all they're doing is talking about Trump and all they're doing is talking about what their friends\nLiberal left leaning white suburban women think about Trump\nAnd they think that's the beginning middle and end of the political conversation in this country and that's what's going to drive everyone that goes to the polls and I can tell you that all of those things that they're focusing on doesn't actually change anyone's mind anyone who was angry at Trump\nBecause they don't like how he talks about women if they call somebody a horse face anyone who was angry about that and decides that they're going to change their vote in November because Trump has tweeted that somebody has a horse face that person was already going to vote against Trump that person was already going to vote against the Republican Party\nThat's not what is determining who you're going to vote for\nWhat's determining who you're going to vote for is what's going on in this economy what's going on with your job situation and what's going on in your life is it easier to pay the bills is it easier to save money is it easier to to do things with your family\nThat you had to put off and not do before do you have job security or is so much security in your profession that you feel like you can go get a job somewhere else and get a better deal\nAnd they're ignoring it again we will not ignore it\nI Want to hear first hand from you\nHow is your land and and I said how has your life better I shouldn't I mean I'm making an assumption how about how was your life different how is it different now I'm almost ... almost two years from election day twenty sixteen twenty three months ago we had election day\nHow is life different for you better if your life is worst\nI'll I'll I'll take your call I Want to hear it but based on all the economic indicators that I'm saying based on the attitude that I see that people have consumer confidence people things that are intangibles things that people are feeling\nA their confidence in the economy the confidence somewhere this country is going everything is picking up and you hear nothing about it\nOn cable news you read nothing about it in the Washington Post on the New York times you've seen nothing about it on broadcast television\nWhy you think that is they're ignoring the exact same story they ignored two years ago I won't let it happen here I Want to hear from your AAA six thirty W. M. A. L. let's start with Harris international burn how how is your life different now Harris and almost two years since election day\nI Would say it's twofold it's physically or mentally and that group of progress pot ...\nDon't have to find out who can't afford it it's okay it's okay to this country to your\nPrevious should crane environment\nSuch as for political party what the country itself and that doesn't make sense they cram\nAll right Harris international you broke up a little bit there but I can I can reiterating his people missed that they use that that it's it's really okay to be patriotic again\nIt's cool to feel positive about this country again because for years you felt like you couldn't ... this country the image of this country and what this country's stood for was getting beaten down by our very leaders ah it was all being a quid vacated it was all yeah we'll get a we're exceptional but you know those grease grease thinks they're exceptional too so what's the big deal\nIt's all a matter of perspective or what where and at this point now we actually have\nA a partners in this world who actually agree that we're exceptional there they're not ashamed to say it at all despite what you hear on our own broadcast network\nUh uh partners in this world who actually agree that we're exceptional there they're not ashamed to say it at all despite what you hear on our own broadcast networks how about ... thanks for the call Harrison Jack you're on WWE a male\nHi Larry thanks for taking my call you bet ya I'm at\nSixty years old I've seen a couple of cycles where we moved from a bad economy back into a good economy I think I can give you our listeners out a couple of things they directly experienced fall where they can see that is actually happening or the first one to exactly in line with what you said um\nI Am now getting a fairly terrible service that fast food restaurant\nTo get involved with a piece of the good people that are productive work on a laugh because they they could go to better places sure enough they disappeared\nAnd I had a little area I consistently getting\nI'm getting orders from the people are getting orders wrong acting like they don't care or\nYou have to upgrade any doubt you've got to go where the good people went\nTo so so basically you're saying that the fast food places places that are paying minimum wage are just scraping the bottom of the barrel they just need a warm body at this point because anyone who has basic skills is getting a better job\nI I didn't want to say it that way by\nAll areas that second\nOne if you thought that was funny the second one okay I ride a motorcycle that are like and I get these catalog but in the mail for Hurley close right during bad economy\nI've noticed that the catalogues have really good looking models and when the economy gets good people in the catalog looked like I\nKnow I mean I don't know I don't know if I Walk down the road with you about what jak but I I mean I think do you do\nNeed it you can absolutely seeing the economy's getting better or are there are companies that kind of relax and say okay let's show with these clothes look like on a regular\nCheck thank you I don't know that my my\nExperiences ... business is that there is a there is never a shortage of really good looking people who would love to be in a catalog\nAnd a bit but I think I'd get your point either way for the call a little bit Jennifer in southern Maryland or what do you think Jennifer how is uh how are things different since election day [noise]\n[noise] Hi yeah actually you know the flip side to this is how I Am an independent restaurant owner okay small business and yes probably do the economy improving\nIt only has still only come so far and all the expenses are still where they're at in terms of um you know the expenses to run our business and because of that I Would love to be able to afford to pay people more than minimum wage but I simply can't\nSo now you run into a situation with Iraq a business like mine where we're having a difficult time finding people to work in our business because they are having the ability to go to other places that are offering them more pro wage per hour\nOkay so so you so you concur with our last caller that that one indication here is that in some restaurants and some other service industries or we're going to see 'em well a poor service because you're getting a a different kind of a job pool that you can draw from\nEggs eggs exactly because you know basically for what we still can only afford to pay 'em now it is what it is like who is available to work for these these kinds of positions and I think we can all agree that\nDespite things getting better um any economy looking better for the younger generation the work ethic isn't exactly era we kind of prefer today yeah and so that's a pretty big challenge\nNow right that's fascinating thank you Jennifer I Love to hear from small business owners because you think oh booming economy is great for all businesses but there is a downside to it as well uh how about a Robert Frederick, Maryland Robert Iran WMU\nHey good at high the economy well one that the media the media kind of knew the American people which is we want information right now\nWe want results right now so\nUm what whatever comes up you can Google it or whatever they get the results were the only thing that's backfiring on the media is\nWith Trump we get results right now so when he said something he can give us the results right now we've got more money in the pocket because the taxes Democrat said that would never happen what makes them look bad and this was just a snowball effect that they're happy that they can't produce the results right now\nSo that the media looks like crap no one believes the media everyone believes Trump and the media can't understand why they believe Trump even though he gets to resolve right now\nBut see I Believe they're still willfully missing a story though Robert it's it's almost as if they're like okay well sure window that's happening but we're not going to ...\nYeah but see it but they're still willfully missing a story though Robert it's it's almost as if they're like okay well sure we know that's happening but uh we're not going to focus on that we don't want to\nBuy it ... exactly so um that that many media also believes Americans are stupid or too stupid to understand that we're getting results in a positive way right now as if they keep\nA broadcast in negative stuff about Trump they think well America must believe this but we do I get more money in my pocket so I Believe the positive and Trump the matter what the media says\nAll right thank you I regret no good a good stuff Robert very good observations I appreciate it how about Martin and bit faster Martin your next up W about how was how are things different for you since election day\nThings are much more of a lot more divided I'll just end up on\nBut some folks if we're going to start cutting ourselves off from the world or as the progressive sometimes you know make military advances against these people\nThis world is going to get out of hand really quickly I think Trump's tried to tread water figure out where his move is figure out how to get leverage and then you get to some of these people using their own bad

a shame I'm Sorry desperately sorry that this happened uh I Hope we need to get to the bottom of it we need to find out exactly what happened and who was responsible it may take a little while um I go back to looking at the use of the chemical\nWeaponry against the two people and Great Britain a few months ago it took several months before it was clear of what had happened there and I think it may take a while before it's clear what is happening here\nBut I think we have to stand up part when we find out what happened and make sure that the appropriate people are brought to justice now what\nWith regard to our dealings with Saudi Arabia and the fact that we have a major arms deal pending with them should that be on hold until we know what happened here should affect that that ah that arms deal at all\nIt really depends on what the intelligent shows Larry and I'm not up to date on what the current intelligence information is if it looks as if they are guilty I Would put it on hold\nYeah and one other a major issue that you will face when you are if you and your house seat a new beginning the next Congress and that would be a move to a there's a too big boats the first is who should be speaker of the house or have you committed one way or the other two congressmen McCarthy or Jordan\nNo I actually know a I have met McCarthy I'm I have not bad Jordan so I mean at this
