I'm not going to mention the polls at all [noise]\nOkay [noise] so so if you if you've come here looking for a breakdown on all the polls and what the poll say and the generic Democrat versus Republican poll which is quite possibly the most useless\nPolitical poll but I'd ever witnessed in my life when it comes to a midterm uh you've come to the wrong place we're not going to do that rocket talk about the generic plus or minus we're not going to talk about the president's approval rating versus this or that we're not going to talk about the popularity\nPolls for the president and how it might relate to a blue wave or red tide and all of those things forget about it\nOr you're smart enough to know and I respect your intelligence enough to know\nThat this is what we're about to

the heck is going to happen three weeks from now\n[noise] but however however\nSomething is different this year I think something is a little bit different in the fact that I think voters on both

analyzing each individual candidates\nThat they might vote for I think more so than any other prior election we are ... ... ... matching up a little bit with the parliamentary style of our friends in Western Europe where you basically vote for the party right\nUh you you vote for a party to be in charge and to be in power and whomever in your district in your locality\nThe so the partisan divide is going to be even more highlighted then we ended up as well and Edward ... thank you for the call if that is the case then we should expect\nThe Republicans to hold onto the house I I think you might be right over it and again don't get me wrong I think that we've got a lot of open seats and I say we because you know I'm a Republican I'm not pretending to be\nNonpartisan I'm not Anderson Cooper who lives do you and says that he doesn't have a political affiliation\nRepublican and and I very much want the Republicans to win but there's so so when I give my analysis take that for what it's worth you know where I'm coming from you know my perspective a ... unlike George Stephanopoulos who pretends to give you a political analysis and then\nThe ... that that's a nonpartisan wouldn't we all know the truth [noise]\nI think that we are going to lose a good amount of houses a house seats [noise] but I don't think ... right on the face of it we're going to lose enough to lose the majority I think that\nExcept for the fact that we have so many open seats and that makes it a little harder to defend those open seats are but I think because there is such a\nFervent partisan\nLoyalty right now in America that\nThat is going to make Republicans in traditionally Republican districts show up where they normally on a mid term would not have shown up especially in mid term where their guy is in the White House [noise]\nAnd I think that that is going to be the difference maker in retaining a narrow narrow majority in the house\nAnd I rarely you know that I Am ... to make predictions but where I sit right now three weeks out that's what I think is going to happen and I think it's because we have reached that point where it has been so hyper hyper viciously\nPartisan and\nPersonally a vicious\nThrough the eyes of these political parties that we've seen for the last two years culminating in the cabinet proceedings\nAnd I think that's going to

I have heard from what I cannot for life and the other they're basically no sir I think from my perspective\nIn a way he has helped really defined the differences between these two parties and I think most Americans don't want to be on that other side of it no they\nDon't and I think he he gave up the idea that this was not temporary that he represents an existential changed that with the illegal immigration or demographic changes or the obsession with the politics\nPeople we're now going to vote according to their race or gender or sexual preference in monolithic fashion and that was going to the New America and we ... we never really heard before Obama White critically show old white guy who's like women\nThat they that was that's become obsessive and you can see these issues that are on the horizon or the next\nTwo weeks or the caravan in the southern border the Elizabeth Warren DNA the school that Kavanaugh hearings that it just happened\nA condoning by mainstream them across the street and the theater every one of those issues play in the hands of Donald Trump that not neither the masses are the best thinkers are empathetic or a cockpit for most voters so I I think they're\nThey're almost a clothing right before the election that is the progressive blue\nWheel and and that's an interesting question here with regard to you know how much of the uh how much of the reaction to what we've seen happen in the Democratic party under Barack Obama the last ten years\nHow much of it is um [noise] he is manifest in the Trump presidency the door the Trump candidate C O and how much of it is a Trump just happen to be the vessel who was able to step up and pointed all out but but without Trump they're still that enormous disparity\nBetween these two message I agree\nNo absolutely I think people realize that Obama when he started his tendency following executive orders and the second term the Iran deal the Paris accord all that stuff\nThat he was counting on they changed the electorate there was the blue wall was going to be permanent that with a timer but for what progressive love the electoral college because the blue wall was in\n... and then the rental slippers on an elected flip to California and Nevada Colorado but I think Obama gave\nThat sense of it it's now a done deal and the Republicans were just there in the headlights so Jeb Bush or read all day\nOr John McCain or you know what we have compromise we've got to have open borders drew we have to have identity politics we have to have the same Obama White platform and bump was the only one that came along and said you know what\nWe can still be in the industrial country we can still be capturing these people ... close calls and they should do or not the ... or ... and that was a new a new idea everybody that ... all my years in\nThe public has included\nVictor Davis Hanson is article is the origins of progressive agony and it's a National Review online today a and I wonder\nUm if if what we saw during the Kavanaugh hearing not just the the protests in mom's clawing at the door the Supreme Court and stopping traffic and all the screaming and what we saw in Portland\nNot not what happened after but add to that people forget what happened during those hearings before the the uh the sexual assault allegations all the disruptions all the screaming is that what we should be become accustomed to now in our in our democratic process in our you know I\nI think that Cory Booker and Kirsten Gillibrand Kamala Harris or or saying to The Elders this is our party or an identity politics radical feminist party we have certainly issue we want we want to abolish ice we want to get a virtual Medicare we want to follow the abolition of student debt\nAnd you're seeing stalwarts of the old generation Nancy Pelosi Dianne Feinstein Joe Biden\nThey're freaking out and then the son of a pathetic way and we have to ... or just saying octogenarian the case of ... how do I act hip and cool so Dianne\nFeinstein does is pathetic hidden letter and you\nSee Joe Biden threatening to beat up from behind the jam Lucy sassy pulls you break you know scare tactics and so so they're trying to get young again\nBehind the jam and Lucy sassy below Sea Bright you know scare tactics and so they're trying to get young again but it's too late that they've been all up and left the station for them\nAnd yet on the Republican side of the equation you know you still got you know the the Marco Rubio's or the world the ... of the world the John Cage six there there were a lot of Republicans who opposed Trump um I guess Rubio sort of picks chooses which Trump he likes to support at various times\nI'm ... but they're still in opposition within the party to President Trump and it's significant and it's real or does the Republican Party also need to continue this sort of internal debate about about how they oppose this radical radical new Democrat Party\nWell for right now they've been very lucky because they're feeding all that's what we talked about this should be on the crowd to kick scream with them and the message has gone out you may not like from what was their hang hang separately or hang together you know\nThese people if they go after ... after anybody he was the Bush for excellence tied for ... ... and so the messages\nPromotion ever bumper I I don't like talk personally I don't like his tweets I think he's cool but right now\nHe's the only guy that I can thank God I'm speaking as if I'm never Trump or yes that will force the border or you'll have some regulation or promote energy production or Keystone Pipeline or they'll go after about somebody and saying regulations of the EPA\nWell and and add to that and and and furthermore I certainly don't want to be on the side that would destroy a man like David Guy Brett Kavanaugh in the way that they did that that's how I suddenly\nThe Trump is not it's not Bill Clinton in the Nineteen Ninety five it's as you say scratching the doors this plane court and trying to destroy somebody like ... a good process\nYeah and and so I ... and maybe that ... that explains you know the transformation of Lindsey Graham the the new religion of Mitch McConnell are they recognize that there was this was a transformative moment for for people like that I think a a Republican to\nAbsolutely I think that people like Lindsey Graham and John Case agent been south or they ... they had to make a decision and some of them made the right to sleep will most specifically Lindsey Graham maybe been south to agree that\nThere are people like John Cage or Bill Kristol speaking people not politics\nThey didn't and they hated low cost so much that they were willing to be on the wrong side of the ... select watch would destroy I think it kind of destroyed that never Trump movement absorb ... percent sixty percent of the never Trump those are the ones that were not absorb\nA are really more or less now abreast of Democrats are useful idiots who they want\nAnd they're really will never be another Donald Trump certainly to take the reins after Trump's presidency is over um but\nBut ... are you seeing Republicans like Mike Pence for example or or other prominent national Republicans sort of getting in the stride and end up finding a way to sort of pick up the reins post Trump\nContinue that but also sort of a reshape it into a more a shall I say\nA ... acceptable [laughter]\nVery odd to to provide that that message\nYeah remember the Republican that done very well at the local and state level and even in the Senate and house lately but they had not one fifty one percent of the vote since Nineteen eighty eight at the presidential candidate level and they lost four or five\nPopular votes and so there was something about a Bob Dole or John McCain or Mitt Romney that was not appealing at least not appealing to people in Michigan Wisconsin Ohio Pennsylvania\nAnd George Bush as well they had and one of those states and so George W. Bush ran against a caucus so and the reason that they wonder why they said there was such a pain free and fair trade what we want people to have a growing four percent of colonies of the worker house where every employer\nWe don't want foreign workers swarming across the border of Mexico you don't want to let people have a three four hundred billion dollar trade surplus is the case of China or Mexico Seventy a German sixty five\nThat's not that's just not a ... that's something that people thought very deeply hurt them Republicans sound that bad formula allowed them to win\nAn eye on Trump's bond there will be very hard for the blue stalking Republican Party\nTo come back and say you know what I'm going to go back to an orthodox economic Bush um you know Bush\nMcCain Romney foreign policy and economic policy if they do that are never going to pick up the working class as if yeah\nAnd so the Republicans have a clear path forward here so let's go back to the Democrats are Victor Davis Hanson our final moments depending on what happened\nIf it were classes\nSo the Republicans have a clear path forward here is so let's get back to the Democrats are bigger Davis Hansen our final moments depending on what happens in the midterms coming up in three weeks if the Democrats do when this overwhelming blue wave it's going to be a long shot for the Senate but if they do win back the house with a clear cut majority\nThat not only sends a message well first of all follows regular historic patterns but does that sends a message to the Democrats okay this is our winning formula we're going to double down on the hysteria we're going to double down on these are despicable tactics\nWeight on the same world as they are a sober Democrat but say you should pick up about

continue today special\nProgram we're spending a lot of time focusing on the mid term elections because it's just three weeks away and oh boy it's going to be a big one\nRepresentative Dave Brat used with seven congressional district here in the commonwealth of Virginia and he is in a tight one and he joins us now congressman record to talk to my friend [noise] hey Larry ... a\nBigger debate was very illuminating last night or people who are not paying attention to the issues you are running against a basically an Obama polo seed Democrat who ah it can be more liberal on the issues that matter most to Virginians\nYeah no that's right the seventh district or is it still common sense is that we just tried to show that uh my opponent or ... is being supported by five million dollars coming in from the ... and act blue and they're trying to buy the election and so we we just tried to show their fundamental differences\nOr yesterday from ... my opponents in favor of open borders sanctuary cities she'd even defended gangs and MS Thirteen on the record all of these are public statements that have been documented and so\nShe she doesn't like that right now that she's on the record there back in the primary riding on those parts but she's she's also on a government takeover of healthcare the Bernie plan on the record she said she didn't ... favorite single payer in principle\nThat's her principal that she had it for that to thirty two trillion dollar piece of socialism and that would require doubling the personal tax rate and doubling the corporate rate that that would put you not into a recession but into a depression I don't understand so she's backed\nOff from her fundamental position is trying to you know real line\nA running boards of moderate with thirty second clips on the news but uh yeah what you're trying to get the word out then I think it's getting across the southern district so I think the the gap\nBut that was was narrowing is now we're we're searching ahead especially after the Supreme Court fiasco that Democrats are showing all their resist\nDoctor kosher for compass that loss we know there are choices out there you'll pay a small fortune for their fake foods bars and gimmicks maybe shots are pills and connect once or twice a month\nI prefer to have the caring Dr supervised team teach you success change your metabolism

for a while there is a no brainer that Republicans will maintain and grow their majority in the Senate\nThey're going to pick up a lot of noise if you see I think I Am one of them that they have their eye on for quite some time but haven't been able to really take has been Claire McCaskill seep in Missouri now Missouri went for Donald Trump something like you don't Missouri used to be a toss up to date with\nMissouri was like Ohio right Missouri was you know how it goes Missouri is how the entire nation will go it was one of those electoral tossup states and\nUh the Democrats are pretty much given up on Missouri at this point I think the last time it was a tossup state was two thousand eight\nWith Iraq Obama and McCain won it in such a way that it's not it's not it's just not a tossup state anymore but Claire McCaskill the Democrat somehow continues to win state wide and we've now learned why ah it's because she's lying to her voters [laughter]\nEvery six years she tries to pretend that she's an independent voice who ah you know ... doesn't always vote in lockstep with Democrats or with the Obama wing of the of the Democrat socialist party but here she is it took a undercover journalist\nLike James O'Keefe and his team a project Barrett house to bring the truth and this is going to damage Claire McCaskill in a enormous way here is a Glenn Winfrey he's a campaign worker\nWait\nAnother first person you're hearing is the project beret toss journalist\nHearing\nAll\nWhat do we found a moderate or we can hammer\nOkay so you heard that because he couldn't McCaskill's been very oh you know we're not focusing on impeachment right now that's a distraction there's no there's no reason to move toward in ... beach meant so odd to get the moderates right and then after the election of course she's going to go right after impeachment\n[noise] [noise]\nWhat do we say to the moderates after she goes for impeachment the answer is get over it\nAnd then and then more lying it was national security she knew all these things that Trump a dumb but she didn't reveal it because she was doing her duty but it was on national security that's why she lied to you okay how about this one or Nicholas ... again talking with the project ... this is another campaign worker\n... to a store that she asked why because because of all there is a [noise] all the more liberal like aquariums are saying ...\n... ... well here's Obama for the last week\nYeah OK and no surprise there right Obama's unpopular in Missouri McCaskill the Democrat doesn't want Obama coming 'cause it's not good for her it's going to make her look bad that no surprise right that's just politics as usual but then there's this again hidden camera\nWhich is our fourth of July ... he loved\nIt and they essentially have the same\nViews on everything [noise]\nYou know let me see what was that [noise] and\nThey essentially have the same views on everything the campaign worker says yeah people just can't know that\n[noise] uh and then here's Claire McCaskill herself when asked about gun control legislation something she dare not discuss to the good people of Missouri but when she's off camera when she is getting caught on hidden video here is Senator Claire McCaskill\n\n\nA A R I and I\n\nWas going for him\nWho are going to be for him the\nOnly thing we can\nGo in and\nYou bet I'd be on board with all those things [noise]\nThere's your Claire McCaskill All right so what what I what I Love about this as Democrats are angry that the undercover video happen what did I get

was watching they're angry that the undercover video that are jammed up he came to town in Missouri and Tennessee is out there why are they angry angry because you actually can see through their lives
