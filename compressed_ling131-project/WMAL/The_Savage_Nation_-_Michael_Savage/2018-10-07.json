Facebook followers on Twitter and Instagram for the most up to date financial news and homeowners can't well we've got to talk about the\nFed hike or the mortgage reports that composting story Federal Reserve hikes grapes predicts aid for a hike in twenty eight teen so nutshell it for me why should I care if I'm a homeowner\nWell here's the thing like the fed definitely raise rates are talking about raising them again here before the year ends may keep in mind we're in October so there's only a couple of chances left where they could movies but I Know one thing I told you before the show and I've been saying over the last couple of weeks\nHere soon you're going to hear the average savings go up so I Know a lot of people are showing what do you think about raids you know are you worried that they're going to go up I actually don't I Love it's going to get people to make decisions are average\nSavings will increase because credit card interest rates are going to go up so high the adjustable rate mortgages are going to become less attracted or a tractable I also think home every lines of credit or going to become headaches a lot of people so it's going to happen is more families are going to choose to do the casual refinance\nThe average savings will increase because the real things affected by this said rate hike is more the arms he walks an adjustable rate and a credit card debts\nThose are the things that you guys need to really pay a lot of attention to I Know that they bumped him up a quarter percent but I saw a staff that said the average\nCredit card rate was Seventeen point three one percent\nThe average car rate is four point eight percent I challenge that when I see these raids all the time were definitely deal at much higher rates than that and on credit cards like you people that have these lending club loans those are twenty thirty some percent so I Believe in this market that the cash out refinance is going to be king you want to work with someone they can get you access to the cash quick\nThat's easy that's not going to nickel and dime ya I Believe in the network Capitol people at the phone number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight because you get great access to a low interest rate like four percent right now and a ten year fix\nThe a P ours for point to age\nYou're not going to get hit with a bunch of fees so regardless of your situation what state you're calling from or any issues in the past you know you know that you what do you pick up the phones and dial eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six said\nYou're not going to get hit hard on origin nation processing fees or a let's say underwriting admin rate log fees I Love the fact that this company chooses to lock the rates up front the average mortgage radio listeners savings five hundred and twenty dollars a month\nAnd what's great about it it can be done in as little as ten business day so I'm Down with this I'm not going to let you guys take higher interest rates in the future you know hopefully all the signs are points so exactly what we've been telling you\nWe used to advertise two and a half percent on the interest rates\nWere sent it to four percent level right now and I'm not worried one bit because you guys are still going to rack up dead you guys are still gonna need to buy homes you're still going to want to try to pay off some things are going to want to do home improvements to make your home more valuable there's all kinds of ways the sills save some money so my question is are you over paint on your situation do you know for a hundred percent you're not\nCall this number eight hundred seven hundred eight zero six eight\nLet's say a little bit more about credit card debt I Know there are credit repair services their debt settlement plans but you are not a fan of those institutions as a way of getting rid of credit card debt\nAbsolutely not I like the ... you know those services as much as I like the Cleveland Browns so you know I'll tell you guys didn't leave if you remember if you want to do something negative to get something positive\nGo down the debt settlement ... enjoy wrecking your credit and just not having these creditors pain again your phone line blown up by every single person trying to get a handout so in my opinion if you want to save money\nYour credit and just not having these creditors pain again your phone line blown up by every single person trying to get a handout so in my opinion if you want to save money to\nDo something positive to get something positive I'm only

be solicited by credit repair services are companies to settle your desk\nFor pennies on the dollar and it is possible but it's unlikely the costs are high and there are better options now one of the things on the mortgage reports they said is\nYou can't remove derogatory history from credit reports if it's true only if it's air number two debt settlement is risky because it may not work\nYou could end up in court and you could have your credit ruined well I like to change the verbiage you could end up in court and your credit could be ruined no it will be ruined you're not paying your payments your pain into the hide your pain into this part they're using thousands and thousands of people as leverage to eventually go and try to settle these that's\nYou know after they do so um you

of the world so Trump is making sure with this extended event in the rose garden today but people get it is important in terms of its in Portland says an election issue it's crucial\nIt is a wouldn't

fact that he was such a drunk he beat people up which is the latest allegation somebody you knew him at Yale guys now a professor in North Carolina has a piece in the Raleigh News Observer that Kavanaugh got belligerent lead drunk\nAnd he is seen it well nobody has any ... information on on Kavanaugh and his drinking in the last Twenty years all that happened was that Kevin all ended up number one in his class in high school\nIn college and in law school somebody so drunk so sloppy planning his next gang rape I'll guarantee you that kind of person does not become number one in anything decent but\nKavanaugh was he was number one in his class in high school and college and the law school capital has achievements Ninety percent of us wouldn't even bother to dream about\nTheir so daunting most of us wouldn't even attempt to them\n\nThey have to go back to high school have to go back to college to find evidence of binge drinking do that you're gonna find binge drinking on

all kinds of self medication on all kinds of\nPeople are drinking and they make excuses for them because the pressure is so intense but\nYou don't find anybody test to find that Kavanaugh's been us fall down beat him up drunk the last twenty five or Thirty years do you or even beyond that\n\nNext they said he he may have committed perjury if he lied about the people on the calendar Andrea he lied about what those terms mean if he is committed perjury is gone winning the FBI to look into that we need the help me out and look into whether or not he beat people up on yells campus\nThat we

need to really track down this judicial temperament of his why you see the way he acted on our committee hearing on friday he was yelling and screaming and that's not the kind of temper we want from a judge well my buddy Andy McCarthy and makes a great point if you want to test if you want to see cabinet those judicial temperament there's a place you can go\nAnd it is called the DC circuit court of appeals where Kavanaugh has been serving for years and all you have to do is go there and study his work and then to the courts prior to that where he was a judge\nAll of this is the last year delay the way they hope to find new women drag new women out with new allegations they hope to come up with new charges\n... minute one week's additional one week FBI investigators agreed to the Democrats started saying one we kept him going to be enough we we can't what last weekend was enough for thousands and hundreds of thousands of Hillary Clinton email James Comey is even gotten on this\nJames combing now making no doubt about his partisanship and this and here's never Trump anti Trump status which is what all of this really is if you if you boil all this now what this is folks\nHatred for Donald Trump by\nThe Washington establishment by the American left by the media on adults are rated do loaded Raul poisonous hatred Brett Kavanaugh is going to be destroyed in the process\nOf damaging and getting rid of Donald Trump\nThey want to delay this beyond the midterms because they are convinced they're going to win and when they when the hand the Senate House and Senate that can pitch Trump they can paralyze the rest of his administration and if uh if if they if Kavanaugh what happened to get on the corner going to teach him to Gerald Nadler who run to the Judiciary Committee for the Democrats\nIn the house he's not even the chairman he's the ranking member and he's already promising to impeach Kavanaugh for perjury and whatever else that has occurred so far if the Democrats win the house\nThey can't stand it they cannot stand that Donald Trump is president they cannot stand that Donald Trump is putting a crutch and is absolutely great human being and conservative on the Supreme Court is driving them hysterically crazy\nAnd so all of this all these new charges all these new suggestions for investigation all these calls for more time all it is is delay the next time you hear\nKevin O's reported way very frequently in college and gotten rock and hit the ball in the face\nSubstitute one word for that delay this is all about continuing to delay it which is why it is and here as it has always been at some point the Republicans would love to shut this down\nAnd call for a vote now as anybody else like me concerned I mean the FBI leadership many of them are gone but a lot are still there has done the it's level best\nTo screw with Donald Trump working with the intelligence agencies we had that cabal conducting a silent cool\nTo get rid of Trump during the campaign and destroy his transition and they have been trying to destroy his presidency what is funny Russia collusion the mother investigation and all that now that same agency with James calling me with an email now encouraging them to dig\nDeep key digging keep getting caught me says there's gotta be something they're\nThe same guy that exonerated Hillary Clinton without even an interview of the same guy that said they've found new questionable emails on the laptop of Carlos danger and in a matter of three days reviewed a hundred thousand of them to find there was nothing there so they can do whatever they're going to do in a day or two if they want to\nBut then what happens if the FBI looks into all of this and reports by the way they reached no conclusions that if they do they will do\nA lot but if in the three oh two is the ... the the the forms and the results of interviews if they\nProduce no evidence\nFor Christine Blasey Ford if they produce no evidence for any other\nAllegation if they cannot produce anything that's his cabinet did it whatever it is\nThat what words if this investigation clears Kevin like every FBI investigation here for ... as you think
