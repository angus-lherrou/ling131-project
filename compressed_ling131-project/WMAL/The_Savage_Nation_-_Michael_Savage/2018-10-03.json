so let me finish my statement Ken\nAll right now here's the thing since her testimony we've had\nMs Mitchell's five page memo the prosecutor questioned her lay out all of the various discrepancies in her testimony we've had other witnesses come forward saying hold on no no no no ah what she said under oath is not true and finally with regard to your statement that he looks like he doesn't care what the FBI has to say\nEverything that President Trump said there in that soundbite has nothing to do with the FBI investigation it's her exact testimony that he's commenting on exactly\nBut it's completely lopsided it's one sided it's not all of the facts it's what she wants to say at a rally [noise] can I ask you a question but\nBut but it's so what is it is what he wants to say at a rally how was that hurting the president's cause how was that courting Brett Kavanaugh's cause\nWell as I said if a direct quote but he said that she was very credible\nUntil we've learned others things in there and then we've learned things since then Ken did you read ms Mitchell's five page memo was showing all the desire not to do it\nWhat does that have to do with the things that he said\nBecause he's echoing exactly what the career prosecutor laid out as all of those\nThings were out of those things contradict her story none of those things make her a liar none of those things are are perjury but my question\nI don't think I don't think the president called her a perjury but go ahead and ask your question\nWell what would live to be going to be perjury or people\nWho are there are people who are saying as a matter of fact other other people on your network who are saying that she should be locked up\nCan I I don't believe that I don't believe the president said she lied to the Senate I think that he called into question her testimony in terms of all the things that she does remember and all that she doesn't remember don't you find it odd that all of the things that she doesn't remember are the things that we could use to corroborate her story\nI I find it odd that we're not looking at the things that would corroborate or story\nLike what give me one thing\nLike the Safeway employment record of the guy that was in the room the guy that was in the room whether or not hearing question or not\nMr judgment and Mr Jones ...

States citizens and actually\nFollow the law can we just have a quickie for those who actually legally under our country and become United States citizens you betcha but they don't get the boat they don't get the passport they don't get the honor of paying federal taxes until they passed the citizenship test\nAnd that's a good thing you should know some basic things about this country before you get that boat and all those things what Paul the dart our power over the Washington secrets column at the Washington Examiner has a a report on a terrifying new study from the Woodrow Wilson national fellowship foundation\nA one in three Americans would pass the U.S citizenship test and and if you're a forty five and younger you know our our our mobile I guess that's part of genetics but if you're forty five and younger\nOnly Nineteen percent of you less than one in five Americans under the age of forty five can pass the basic US citizenship test and I would have to deal with that that's\nKind of part of the problem\nI mean honestly if you just watched the schoolhouse rock cartoons for a good couple of days and binge the heck out of that you would do better than most Americans right now on the citizenship test\n[laughter] so it just got me wonder and it got me thinking that got me you know scratching the old knocking on the top of my shoulder blades\nLittle higher than the blades but sometimes I you know ... should we Institute of citizenship test before you get the votes aided eight six zero nine six two five should someone have a basic working understanding of our government before you know they make the decisions affect things back government\nTriple eight six thirty there'd be a male I I guess the thought process has always been that you know you get the but when you're Eighteen and all of us as seniors in high schools we have to pass we can't get our diploma unless we passed the civics class right that's still a requirement isn't it\nPrecise than traditional

mid term elections only thirty six percent pass them basic citizenship test right now\nAnd by the way to pass you only have to get sixty percent of the answers correct or this from a friend Paul ... over there at the Washington Examiner has great Washington\nSecrets column I just should there be a basic citizen sip test\nTo get the right to vote now I I'm sure why not why do we want a bunch of stupid voters out their voting for all the wrong reasons I wrote and with that is not even knowing listen ... and this is the great thing you know who opposes this idea you know who opposes Issa left opposes it\nAnd and I love engaging in this debate you know I I think you should have some basic understanding of how our government works how about for a naturalized citizen to be in this country they have to pass a test how about for every citizen they have to pass that test before they get the ball will know you're trying to stifle about\nYour tried to keep people that they actually will call they'll say this is racist which is beautiful it's like oh okay so you think that people who aren't white are dumb\nBut they can't pass the test the ad is that what you're saying that seemed to me what you're saying it seems to be but if you say this has raised it it seems to me that you're saying that people of color or not smart enough to pass the test\nThat are good I just want to have you on record and also by the way really good to have you on record saying that you don't want there to be an informed electorate\nYou know they're they're worried think about this for a minute it bothers them to think that voters will be educated and informed and understand how our government is supposed to function and understand our basic history that's a concern of there's that's a concern of the left\nEye okay good glad you're on record with that position I think we know everything we need to know [noise] how about Craig in the district Craig you are on W. A. L.\nLarry pay that quick that question like licking ice cream cone ... itself\nOr what the answer to again oh then what's the answer\nWell of course we should have a a citizenship test okay or a couch you know the kind of a test you're talking about but I agree with what you're saying a little bit later about it that it will never happen because ... say is racist\nOh I didn't say it would never happen I'm just saying that's what their argument is but but that doesn't mean we shouldn't fight the fight and exposes their position and it's always good to expose their position we should have a nice respectful debate in this country about who is in favor\nOf an educated electorate and uninformed electorate that has a basic understanding of our government functions and what our history is and who was against that but\nThat's all and if we lose the argument that's fine but at least the American people will know who's on what side how about Lori in Michigan she's living in the mitten go blue you're on WMA or do you\nThat I Am living a life and again\nI agree with you completely on the citizenship test but one thing that scares the hell out of me is how many people want to lower the voting age are you kidding me\nThat that scares\nMe oh they they push him to do that here in the nation's capital they want fourteen year olds devote Laurie\nOh ... I don't know half of them can't figure out what side of the ... get out of in the morning I mean come on\nReally a ... year old and everything you know I'll go you're one battle ahead\nI Am tired of these people that we're lack conquer who had no idea if they have no idea what the constitution says\nI Want to see a memorandum and a\nHalf percent Laurie Pearl to prove that they know the kind of fear you might be you Laurie you have gotten me\nBetter absolutely ex candidate basic citizens\nOh the ... here she you aren't you Laurie you\nHave gotten me one better absolutely a candidate for basic fittest and that [noise]\nThat would be some light for and I need to be an oral exam and needs to be public so we can all see their response is let's start with Maxine Waters\nIt's for forty four I'm W A L Washington\nMall W.

were building up so late if you were I Would do on that like a hundred dollars for your chair your favorite shirt I Would bet you are\nUm engage in in this cat and mouse game where a Deborah cats is refusing to hand over actual evidence which would be the the therapists notes and I'm more information about the polygraph\nAnd the the the cats um lawyer is refusing to to give it to anyone except for the FBI and we already know that that is a whole kabuki charade um because whatever the FBI gonna come out with nobody is going to believe [noise]\nUm so I I I I don't know what's going to happen particularly with Jeff Flake Lisa Murkowski and I'm senator Collins I mean that's what I I I've always been nervous about uh that\nConstellation in the Senate Republican universe and I'm more nervous about them than I ever happen\nWhat what do you think of how the White House has been handling this and and certainly over the last ah two twenty four hours a President Trump got quite aggressive last night in in calling out\nUh what he's what we also is the inconsistencies and Dr Ford's testimony and then they're all gonna be Sanders absolutely back to the president today was an incredible performance in the press room are they on the offensive and should they be on the offensive [noise]\nWell I'm Glad to see it and I understand that there are a lot of hand ringers on in the beltway ... who are appalled to see a a President Trump as aggressive as he was but he didn't say anything that I agreed with last night\nAnd then certainly you can coral as the never Trump I'm for it always well about the tone and the timing of but I but I think it's about them time that we talked about exactly these kinds of things because anyone who was a a veteran or expert ah\nActual expert within the criminal justice system do you have to ask these questions we have to highlight inconsistencies and memory gap\nAnd in particular as I did in a a video for see our TV this weight a look at the absolute dissonance between\nChristine Blasey Ford behavior during the hearings Merced is her actual record as an academic with a a very\nUm we're in now special tea and statistics and data and Irish and I'm In the piece that I'm married to a health policy analyst PHD so we're in the exact same testicle consultation area that Dr Ford did and that is shepherding\nA medical device and pharmaceutical companies to the FBI regulation process anybody who's married to a PHD in any um math science or economics area a field no people are obsessed with the tail\nSo the idea that you couldn't even remember if she gave a therapist no to the Washington Post two months ago strains credulity\nYeah you're so right Michel Martin but you know you so often write and speak eloquently about what\nHappens outside of Washington DC and and as our late ... rubber used to say you know politics is of course downstream of those other institutions the media Internet my culture in academia on this topic with regard to how the entertainment world is going to cover it and and\nHave it be ingrained in their storylines for years to come and and what's going to happen on college campuses with the abuse of title nine has this ship already sailed now sadly ... are they going to take this Kavanaugh thing and sort of up and the way our our country is setting aside the Supreme Court\nWell they've perfected that witch hunt process with their a title not nine Shan hearing than we have that neither of us that the U.S partners education different terrain that end but in terms of the culture you're absolutely right\nLarry and of course a Andrew Breitbart with also write about this\nAnd this is something that has been nurtured in TV and movie storylines for years and decades now and the idea in in whether it pop culture or political culture that you should never question\nA an accuser is something that is now in that it and that is why there's such a violent reaction I think um to President Trump's comments yesterday but if we don't have the G act\nThese kinds of accusations too you know a credible search for truth why do we even have a criminal justice system\nYeah that's a great question and I know that you've been covering this so much for UC miscarriages of justice like this so often and so I'm Glad that you are the tip of that spirit thank you for being there\nThanks I appreciate that and you know it was wrongful conviction day just yesterday I spent all day tweeting about numerous cases and I've now\nNow now investigating probably breed dogs in these cases this is happening to men every day in America and it makes me fear as I mentioned to you in our last conversation or my boy as much as my girl yeah absolutely we are all concerned about our children\nBad
