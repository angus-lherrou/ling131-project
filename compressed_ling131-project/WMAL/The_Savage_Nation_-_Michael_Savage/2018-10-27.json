Nineteen Ninety seven online training Academy of two campuses to serve our listening audience one and Tyson's corner and one will be ... airport that I saw funny commercial this week it was from allied bank and it was talking about the biggest bank heist ever\nAnd it wasn't talking about a robbery at least from a bank was talking about how banks are basically robbing individuals' of a fair amount of interest\nAnd this idea outback of trying to show that they're you know they're being so much nicer to their clients so instead of offer you one percent on your money they're offering you two percent or some other small amount and it goes to what we've been talking about here on the do it yourself investor show for a long time\nIs that you know that's fun for a little bit of your money but there's no way that putting your money in a bank or using these other financial services\nOffers are are going to help you actually generate income you need to live the life you want\nAnd so you know the biggest bank job ever was you know what's happening now but it really started about ten years ago and I was watching I was on HBO and I was watching a show called too big to fail and it was an HBO movie that was focused on what happened back in ...\nAnd I was on HBO and I was watching a show called too big to fail and it was an HBO movie that was focused on what happened back in two thousand and eight and it was about the the Federal Reserve and the Treasury's efforts to basically save\nSaves the modern financial system and it it it was kind of interesting portrait of kind of behind the scenes of what were what were the government folks consider at the Treasury Department and you know what what were the what were the things that they were really afraid of and and being that we're at the tenth anniversary of that\nI thought it was pretty pretty interesting to see that because they were worried about the total collapse of the global financial system\nAnd that was what we're faced with that wasn't really you know ... it was pretty stark behind closed doors that wasn't what was being talked about in October however a few months later everyone kind of saw the reality of the collapse of the global financial system and\nYou know we had this community in our midst here at the unload trade academy Baltimore online training academy and Tyson's corner where you know like minded people get together and share their success and share their challenges and just in the last week we've had\nEvents with you know hundreds of people coming in\nAnd we had one event where students that are members of our mastermind community and to that as our highest level community for folks that are looking at treating themselves like a business\nAnd what we've done is we've created a streamlined way for them to take advantage of the resources available to them in the mastermind community and the mess my community allows them to tap into expertise from orange truckers\nAnd so we have we have over a hundred twenty instructors all a professional traders and they hold sessions in the mastermind community also students from all over the world have the opportunity to hold sessions as far as sharing what they're doing with their trading and\nSwapping ideas for a lot of people that are engaged in the financial markets you\nKnow the only source of ideas that have is you know watching CNBC or Bloomberg or you know the wall Street Journal or barons stuff that's the kind of dated and bought into the old model of making money\nWhereas if you really want to be figuring out where the best opportunities today you want to have access to other people with the same perspective with the same training\nAnd you know think about this you know if you worked for Goldman Sachs\nYou wouldn't just roll out of bed in the morning and start trading right in your pajamas you to get your best suit on you'd make sure that you connected with your experts from all around the world sort of understood what was happening out there\nAnd then you would apply you're proven system\nAnd look for income opportunities based on what you've proven to yourself works\nCommunity allows our students to do because they have access to hundreds of instructors as well as hundreds of students from all around the world that are looking to build it up as a business and looking to generate income\nYou know for the rest of their lives and do things and safer and smarter ways and also get outsized returns for those who have the experience of being taken the time\nTo really develop their own personalized approach to the market\nSo if you want to take a look at designing your own lifetime income strategy they'll come visit us in the next Saturday November third ten am\nWe're going to be at the home would sweets in Springfield, Virginia and so for the folks down south you know folks in Woodbridge and Stafford or the folks over in in uh Fort Washington or Alexandria they'll come and visit us at the home would sweets in Springfield on Saturday November third ten am\nAlso have classes at the online trade academy Baltimore as well as the online trade academy Tyson's corner tray academy Baltimore's right up for one hundred Ninety five and two Ninety five\nHundred academy Tyson's corner is a Spring Hill road so if you're ... metro accessible and get on the silver line and we're short walk from the silver line metro ... Spring Hill road stop 'em but also anyone in northern Virginia can access us Saturday in November third ten am\nWe have other dates as well so Thursday November first we're going to be an Alexandria we're also going to be up in Germantown on Thursday November first\nAnd friday November second we're going to be out and do all this corner and also in Columbia town center and so part of this as you know we started this year with the mission of reaching ten thousand students a touching ten thousand folks this year\nAnd so in November we're going to pass that number\nAnd part of that is is that this has been a huge demand for people to learn about becoming a do it yourself investor and it's also you have the opportunity for you to start saying you know realizing that you you are on your own but there's never been a better time for you to engage with the market\nAnd so you know folks that are looking for strategies to generate lifetime\nBut there's never been a better time for you to engage with the market\nAnd so you know folks that are looking for strategies to generate lifetime income\nYou know we're going to have Sam ... he'll talk a little bit about you know how to create your own annuity in the next segment and part of that is just realizing that whatever the financial services industry provides for you\nYou can do yourself and not pay them the fees and not incur the same level of expenses related to that so if you want a mutual fund does it do it yourself investor you can create your own mutual fund\nIf he wanted to do it he has to do it yourself and best you can create your own annuity and not pay commissions not pay fees not pay the same level of expenses if you do it yourself and if you're looking for a kind of a safe investment is going to\nProtect your principal and make sure that you get a opportunities for upside whether that stock market up side or upside other markets that are trending up their strategies you can use to protect yourself but more importantly give you the peace of mind\nAnd so part of what we do students is help you develop your own personalized success plant\nSo every student that comes in works from the education counselor\nThat education counselor helps you identify you know what assets you have and\nThen one of those assets are currently unproductive because remember and unproductive asset is anything that's designed to get single digit or negative returns and for most people the majority if not all of their assets are in unproductive opportunities\nAnd so what we want to reduce our identify more productive uses for the unproductive asset and think about this if you were operating yourself as a business if you were going to be a business person would you ever invest your hard earned capital in something that's on the generate two three four percent\nThere's no way you would do that right you're looking for you know ten percent twenty percent beyond that and that's what we wanted to start thinking about whether your financial assets it stopped being satisfied with these mediocre returns and open yourself up to the opportunities around you as a do it yourself investor\nAs one of the things we know today is that you know people are wealthy but they don't feel wealthy so we have a number of students that came in this week who had a nice income but they're still living paycheck to paycheck to they have so many expenses between college education student loans car payments\nAnd part of this that says you taking control of your own income and realizing that you have time that you can be using more effectively focused on learning how to generate more income and the financial markets and recognizing that you know as friendly as they are you know the conventional financial services folks aren't for you\nAn ally back is telling you that they're they're insiders and they're telling you that folks in their industry are not looking out for your best interest\nAnd you know they're basically you know they call the other bankers as a bank robbers or if back in the um\nBack in two thousand two thousand nine instead of calling them gangsters recalled banks there's\nBecause they just figured out how to extract money from us as individuals and keep it for themselves and so as a do it yourself investor we want you to understand that you've got to start learning how to protect your money and that's the first lesson particularly in this market environment\nWith increased volatility market's going up markets going down an asset ... happens that's more opportunity for do it yourself investor there's more fear\nFor someone to use the conventional approaches 'cause the conventional approaches don't work in a highly volatile market they basically need a sleeping market where things just go up up up well that moment has passed guy we've had that for a few years we're no longer in that sleepy mark yet we're now in a high volatility market\nAnd the high volatility market if all you have the conventional financial approaches that's a really scary market\nHowever if you have the tools of do yourself investor\nAnd you have a proven system that you can use the fines safer and smarter places to buy and sell and you understand how to lead bridge or assets and then also have to make sure that for any risk you take you understand it but also you have an opportunity for greater award\nYou know that's the foundation for you know learning how to generate money has to do it yourself investor\nIt's also the foundation for learning any skill\nYou know if you want to learn something new\nYou need to get the probability in your favor by\nGoing to someone with a proven system so learning about proven system learning from someone who has more experience has had success in that business or that would that skill and given your and learning how to practice in a focused manner so focused practice as essential\nTo allow you to start getting better better skills and better results in your life also to leverage you want to leverage other people's knowledge you want to leverage other people's resources\nLife also to leverage you want to leverage other people's knowledge they want to leverage other people's resources\nAnd no matter what scale you're learning getting probability on your side\nGetting leverage on your side is part of how you learn like when you went to school you use their textbooks you use their chairs you have their expertise to allow you to build up your skill build up your confidence and then once you start then the next step is to help them understand your risk and how to reduce the risk\nIn any action you take that part of that as learning the rules of the game and learning how you know you can you know what your best out in the game and learning how your opponents think\nAnd that's how you start developing an edge\nTo develop any skill including the skill of duty herself investor so part of the class that you'll be attending is focused on getting to understand probability leverage risk reward and do that and the financial markets but recognize\nIt starts with where your money's invested so instead of having all your investment capital in the stock market right whatever age you are whenever you have um\nDon't have any of it there instead put it into bonds or you know interest generating\nA vehicle right for example um corporate bonds or in this day and age there are some pretty good bond funds out there there's not a lot but there's two or three really good ones and um we're talking short maturity high yield very safe\nAnd would that so but you reducing the risk and basically you're limiting stock market\nOr you're limiting stock market risk but now you have this pile of money generating income generating interest income\nWhat we do is that as we use the options markets so instead of buying the stock market by owning stock we can buy options on the stock market\nSpecifically find calls if you don't understand will cause our options again instead of buying the actual market you are buying the option to buy the market so it's it costs so much less far less money than to actually buy the stock but you still get the benefit of the gains of the stock market so\nI'm so essentially what we're putting together he what was put together as a\nGift buying options on the market so the market goes up you make money\nIf it goes down\nYou can hear your principal you're not losing any of your principal because your money's not actually in the stock market\nSite and so it's totally protected and then at the same time you use that extra income by the calls which gives you\nThe upside gains in the market now there's nothing there's no risk right I mean I'm so where is the risk in this investment you're only risk is in the credit risk of the bombs right so um now I I Can't remember any time that there's been a follow up on his fault that you stick with safe stuff [noise] and um\nSo that's part of the analysis that she helped me to walk through and it was once they own the calls how frequently would they do that would just be once a month once a quarter once a year\nYeah barely once a month this is not an active strategy is a very hands off but essentially the end what you've created is stock market gains with zero stock market risk to your principal\nBanned um fees are low because you're doing yourself extremely low and I'm a liquid he's fine and the interesting\nThing is that's exactly what Wall Street does when they create an annuity and we have a lot of people that are buying annuities because they want safety and what you're you just laid out people how they can do it themselves what they say if they do it themselves\nOh yes so I'm also so just to back up a teeny bit um what were essentially saying here as this is how you can build your own annuity and remove the fees\nReferring move the whole you know ten to twenty year lock up period and all that stuff and um\nWhat Wall Street does with the exact strategy that we just laid out is you know they put it in a pretty box and with ... and had fees and and lock up periods and surrender charges and everything else and it's called an annuity right and and you know the United states I mean billions of dollars every year goes into\nA annuities right so um [noise]\nAnd uh and and the people that are paying for their brochures and all the fancy offices basically get to keep all that for themselves if they use the strategy you just laid out [noise]\nSure you don't yeah exactly or the you know you can learn how to do this and do it yourself and there's other things but again starting on the wall street side of the business you know you learn simple strategies like this and how things really work\nAnd we know to be an effective do yourself investor you need to get educated to our sponsor online training academy is making ten seats available to a

she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different needed I time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... happy and career and training something that I

walk us through how we can\nUse the tools of being do yourself investor and if we understand how the market's really work\nWe can use the same strategies that the professional banks ... views on us and then charges the high fee to take advantage of\nBecause you know there's there's a time in life when I have been annuity makes a lot of sense there's a time in life where to get that steady stream is really beneficial and but at the same time if you learn how to do it yourself\nYou don't have to pay the commissions you know an annuity is the highest commission product out there in the financial services industry and sometimes it's basic ten percent right off the top\nAnd then on top of that on an annual basis you know they're charging fees cream four to seven percent per year\nWhereas if you learn how to do it yourself you'd have to pay some be some expenses related to it but no fees and you'd be able to preserve the benefit of your assets that you've worked so hard for\nFor you as well as for your family and for your legacy and so horrible wanting to do is start sinking bigger about the opportunities that are out there and you know the financial services folks have been a great job of beating down your expectations and get needs to be happy and making three four or five percent on your money\nYou know as they do it yourself investor ruin the fun more productive uses for assets you know we're going to start looking at ourselves like a business and making businesslike decisions with our money and if we're going to make a business like decision we're going to look for productive uses of our assets you know double and triple digit opportunities [noise]\nAnd so this week one of our students re a walk me through how he had identified an opportunity using his method

students including re who each took this opportunity based on the\nProven system they learn to be online training academy based on their own individualized\nApplication of the proven system and you know we're re had done was in the course of things about an hour he made about seven thousand dollars with his account and to do that he needed to have [noise]\nProbably about Fifteen thousand dollars and his account and so that was a pretty good return for that day [noise]\nAnd part of this is realizing that you know if you have the right tools and understand the power of your assets the return you can get is a lot greater than what you've been led to believe but you need\nAnd understand the power of your assets the return and you can get is a lot greater than what you've been led to

AAA six zero nine six two fathers AAA six zero Ninety\nSix twenty five actually I'm Glad I'm here for you because you know it's stories like this month central thing that really jak me up and get me to say that's why I'm supposed to be you know shared that's why I'm doing the things that I Do and [noise]\nYou know it's unfortunate that many of us have been duped and taking advantage of because we just don't know all for somebody's touching you know the big bucks that goes into their their pockets so we're going to talk a little bit more about that but more importantly but I Want you to do is I Want you to be your own advocates I Want you to do the work\nThere's an interesting book I mentioned several times in the past and it's and it's called seeds of deception and very well written book is a guy by the name and Geoffrey Smith wrote it at its exposes the industry and government lies about the safety of genetically engineered foods that you're eating [noise]\nUm get a copy of it you can read a lot of it on line at the last I saw it's been out for a while but it was the first book ever to point the finger at what was really a being hidden from you and genetically modified foods and how they're affecting the body well the problem\nThat we're dealing with is direct result of the collusion between the government and companies like Monsanto as I said earlier is still not owned\nBy um [noise] in a bear so do your homework go on line check out the documentary and if that doesn't irritate you uh you got a problem\nYou need to be stored up in a different way because you have to protect yourself we're starting to be due for like lemmings now we're being told something of his online it's true right of Dr Mugele says it it has to be true you need to do your your work let's go to the phones John thank you for calling how can I help you sir\nOh it's it's so Joan I'm Sorry\nOh no that's all right Dr ... thank you for taking my call I just wanted to reinforce what you're saying about round up my mom what the doctor and you remind me very much of her\nShe had a farm in Maryland has had a fifth off and Jonathan grass on it and many times that state officers would come out and say she had noxious weed\nAnd they insisted that she spray the property with round up and she had to have a certification of it but she was like you she refueling and instead she planted that property in time and shaded the noxious weed Thad\nFor sharing that John that's you know that's what you do you know sometimes you have to take a stance and sometimes you have to say hey listen I'm nuts enough already you know I've put myself on the line many many times and I've had a few interviews if you will with a different uh investigatory boards and so forth fortunately\nThe information that we do share with you is documented and it's exactly straight up and I wouldn't tell you anything that I wouldn't tell my own family now there's a guy many years ago that had an expression said mother father ... mother father brother sister child\nNever say anything give anything to do anything for anyone that you wouldn't do for your own family and it's important that we lead with that and but it it's unfortunate that that's so much is hid from us because\nOf the potential profit margin that it brings about and you know we're talking about health and we wanted to clean up our health care if we want to reduce the health care costs if we want to drop\nThe budgets in this country all we have to do is begin to be proactive for ourselves you know how many patients come in to see me and I are unwilling\nTo make any changes in their lives you know that it's too difficult issue heart you know they did a documentary on the work that we are that we do have the result Center for about six years ago\nAnd it basically it was called agents health the movie and it was a it was a PBS special night I'm In a documentary and it was about six patients who had failed under traditional care and the approach\nA that these patients were being treated with was at our opinion unnecessary minimally and in some situations on my God they're making the condition from a young girl who had MS who had moved so quickly when we\nAh had gone through history she when she was first diagnosed shut Fort lesions one of them was breaking the court down she went to twenty four and lesions inside two months and a little boy who was off the charts ADHD and a a little girl whose sole allergic to everything\nInside two months and a little boy who was off the charts ADHD and a a little girl who was so in order to everything anyway\nSpecifically states that you can't use genetic editing and humans to create X Y and Z the truth than it is is being done\nAnd there's a lot of called a black papers that are showing and suggesting that things have done as has cloning hunting also has been done don't for yourself for one minute that it hasn't it's called the phones John how can I help you\nSaid there was a pretty sure she would call a I've been having over the last couple of years a\nLower ear wax buildup than I've ever had before they're not judicious about you know slowly getting it out but not much I don't know that's why I'm asking you I'm getting these little shift behind the ears\nAnd going down a down down down toward and behind the jaw a bone and\nI don't know if these little sisters are not messing with them and they slowly kind of dry up but I don't know if they're associated\nTheir toxic buddy what's that what's happening any time you seize cystic formation like that and the skin gets remembered something your skin is one of them is the largest organ of elimination and your body along with your kidneys your colon your lungs\nAnd so forth that gets rid of all the junk called the poison so when we see things are updating through our skin other than you know uh because the sun damage and things of that nature your body is trying to get rid of something and as as fighting to get it done if you look at somebody's nose and around the nose area if there's a lot of\n... a eruption on the nose to nose starts falling that's usually liver function problem delivers toxic and the bodies start showing that if you start seeing any kind of\nLymphatic lumps and bombs obviously number one get them checked out make sure that they're not something more significant more dangerous but if they're there are cystic whether a rupture in through and and you know they're ... or so forth or they're red irritated\nThat somebody's indication that there's some kind of um [noise] toxicity within the system that your body is trying to limit so just as a checklist I Would say to you take a look at and this goes along with your ear wax\nTake a look at what your dietary patterns have been over the last few years have they changed has your exercise changed how are you drinking as much water how you're drinking more coffee or more alcohol or is there more sugar in your diet\nYou know those are the things that you start with and are you a ... working the way they're supposed to and you're more constipated and you've been in the past\nSo begin to do like a check off a list of you know do I may during this somebody doing that I'm doing this\nAnd then begin to eliminate it if you want to really clean up your body should be alkaline so alkaline means tons of vegetables that means things like avocado it means the elimination of you know sugar so it was coffee black too fast food fried foods are called gluten as preservatives GMO products [noise]\nThose things will cause the body to be a ...\nAnd when that happens your body's gotta do something with it and if it's two plugged up to begin with most people think waters for Washington not drinking\nAnd unfortunate way in you know the good news and the bad news is the good news we need water the bad news is that you know we have to be careful of the water that we get and even if we drink quite a while I drink water out a bottle of well if it's a plastic bottle then you're getting estrogenic\nEstrogen diet are leeches into the water from anything that's plastic unless it's a non if it's a BPH free plastic than you beat that thing [noise]\nBut the point of it is is that you have to be a guardian of what's going on it's a sign that tells you that there's some level of toxicity within your body that your body is trying to get rid of and without going into a detailed consultation with you I Can't tell you what it is but I can tell you that you need to do something a little bit more specifically\nUm you know than just be aware of them as your your your ear wax and your skin a\nSays are unfortunately in my mind I have some parallels so\nIf we can help you obviously we you know we're glad to do it uh but you need to do something about a AAA six zero nine sixty five ... six zero nine sixty five you know it's really an interesting thing when it comes to Iraq's a ear wax is you know we all have some ear wax\nAnd you know it's there for a couple of reasons\nAnd but when we have huge levels of accumulation of ear wax is generally because something's going on inside the body and we have to be very very careful with that is a is important that you know we look at all the things that\nWe consume that were exposed to the the computer screens the paths that we ... you know that we're constantly on the devices that we have all of these things\nWe consume that were exposed to the the computer screens the pads that was you know that we're costs and the devices that we have all of these things add to let her magnetic pollution if you will to our bodies\nYou know think about it how many of you sit there in front of the ... in front of a computer screen all day and then you go home you know the front of a computer screen you carry your your uh\nUh yourself on your smartphone with those of you know me if I if I meet you and I see you have your cell phone in your pocket on your chest I ... and ... when a conversation I ... I notice that I go over and grab it and I put this in your pocket please [noise]\nThat low revolt that low dosage of EMS ... frequencies are affecting your heart\nAnd you have to be aware of that you know there's you can go online to our website or you can go online anyplace Clarence corporation makes a very\nA lovely little pendant that you can wear around your neck that interrupts the EMS or scrambled to that so it doesn't have such a profound effect and also they have these little bugs will come a little bugs that you can put them on your phone and they scramble the map so at least you can help yourself a little bit you get in your car you you know all the Bluetooth technology is dangerous to your body\nAnd you have to make sure that you guard against that because it's disruptive as as a problematic [noise]\nThink about all the ... or people that you know today they're coming down with different types of cancers [noise] you know we see a young people unfortunately in today's world that are their bodies are breaking down to rapidly too quickly\nThey shouldn't be doing that at the age is that they're at and it's because of the things that they're doing the exposures that they have\nThe fact that they're constantly in front of you know these\nThese computer screens or on their phones they don't get how they don't get any exercise they grabbed his ... catches catch can they don't eat the way they're supposed to [noise] it's an unfortunate situation and we're getting deeper and deeper into a hole that is just unnecessary in my opinion\nWill getting more about that I Am on a soapbox today I can feel it I can feel it deep inside of me let's go to the phones Wal Mart how can I help you\nHide doctorate now um I guess it'd be a patient up yard how my daughter get better ... it's the little girl I'm I kind of tactics I'm ... Twenty years ago and have not been able to get rid of anxiety and depression [noise]\nAnd um [noise] I've gone through another power out of this last summer of having a lot of anxiety again and serious depression\nKale talked about how we can um how I can I can do to make it better sure I Am currently on ... and and I'm Sorry I'm On a credit cleaned I it it's a lot of vegetables fresh fruit\nAnd what it what it tells me that says that outlined patterns in other\nUh microorganisms like that can cause a disruption in the know transmitters at the bottom line has a bad habit of brain itself into a into the intestinal lining into lymphatic system in what's called the ... a friend that lives over the lower pushing the intestinal track [noise]\nBut it just and and the reason I bring that up and also gets in the brain or you know you read the literature we know that that happens [noise]\nAh the reason I'm bringing it up is that your intestinal system produces eighty percent of your neuro transmitters and if that's disrupted in any way because of long using if you were treated medically with antibiotics doctors cycling and be in the drug of choice\nOr your guts not working and so you're going to get your regular uh balances and things like\nA serotonin and gab and dump them in the I mean and so for all things that your your brain needs for regulation so that the truth to it is until you reset to that neurological platform and you make sure that there's no ... film that is hiding any of the uh the line where the coal infections from lime\nYou and you continue to go on with this anxiety and depression that gets worse or doesn't mean is is one of the primary things and it's messed up anytime that using an antibiotic or any kind of immunological suppressing Tobar overtime\nSo that's where we would start so that there are things that can be done but you have to find out specifically what's going on [noise] um\nAnd you start with the guy that\nI Would start with an examination first to find out what your nervous system is doing and then finding out what you know what all the pieces obviously you know anybody that comes in our practice we look at them multi dimensional if we look at you know somebody comes in\nThe first thing that they they do before they even see mayor either my doctors since they we do simple things but we do a blood pressure but guess what we do them in three different positions because it tells us something very different redo pulse oxygen nation we do a\nZinc tallies we'd do an occupied your graphs screening ah we we do some neurological testing and then you know there's a couple of things than the examination actually starts so we put a lot of pieces together and then if we need to get some functional medicine testing done than we do the neuro transmitters and\nThere's a couple of things than the examination actually starts so we put a lot of pieces together and then if we need to get some functional medicine testing done than we do the transmitters and you know we we may do you know some adrenal function testing we may do some uh some other times it depends on the condition so uh you have to let", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Savage Nation - Michael Savage", "city": "Washington", "day": "27"}
