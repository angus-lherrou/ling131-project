right now we're waiting on Peter Navarro who is with the White House he was the chief negotiator for the president and his NAFTA agreement renegotiation\nAnd I'd like to hear a little bit of the president's a press conference earlier today announcing that\nMy great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand new deal\nTo terminate and replaced NAFTA [noise]

but I'm not for me to say not a marine like to hear\nThe Marines are All right with it but it is pretty significant that the president promised that he was ridiculed about what would it go bomb always was you're going to use a magic wand than just you don't make these things go away you can't really go jaded can't ... well he did a and a let's not forget Canada right up until like last night was having trouble coming to the table on this thing\nAnd uh well they got they got the deal and I think the deadline that was set by the president uh basically forced candidates hand in Canada realize okay we're either going to be a part of this or not and it's better off to be a part of this\nThroughout the campaign promise to renegotiate NAFTA and today we have kept that promise but for twenty five years as a civilian as a businessman I used to say how can anybody have signed that deal like NAFTA\nAnd I watched New England and so many other places where I was just the factories were leaving

dissection of this story\nAnd and and exposing all of the holes inconsistencies and lack of credibility within the story I think what ms Mitchell did was exactly what needed to be done there wasn't any emotion involved there wasn't any hostility there wasn't any drama it was just cold hard fact it was Joe Friday sometimes you need Joe Friday\nAnd and I think that that this was good especially with all the analysis that we've seen not just from her five page memo that she's put out\nA little labeling and detailing all these inconsistencies and saying there's no prosecutor in their right mind credibly who would ever bring charges here which by the way ironically is exactly what James Comey said about Hillary Clinton's email\n'em but also the article that expanded on that that by repaid and if the federal is do we just had on earlier in the program or if you missed it make sure you get the podcast you can hear that because she lays out twelve major inconsistencies\nIn this
