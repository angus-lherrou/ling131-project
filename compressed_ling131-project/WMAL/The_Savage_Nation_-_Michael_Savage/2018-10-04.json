put on your roller blades and catch them all on video acting like being seen screaming Mimi that they are\nWill play a little bit more of it a little later on as we see what's going on the scene down there in our town coming up in the work like our going to be joined in Studio by Kurt ... his book militant normal it's sort of made to order\nFor this week's news cycle and I can't wait to talking about the book and also his observations about what's happening right now John Solomon the hill has a new story about\nSpygate and how the Democrats were involved in the whole thing that we now know\nUnder that moniker he'll join us to a whole lot more to come as we see the story developing before our eyes the Kavanaugh vote has been called Stephen diamond is with the\nWashington Times as Chris ... says your paper of record here in Washington DC is a political editor and when you're the political editor the Washington Times you just said your dream for weeks like Stephen ... have you gotten any rest yet\nI Dream may be a nightmare and though the answer's not addressing it doesn't look like there will be ... next forty eight hours but it is what we live for but when you're in the middle of it you you you do hope it would a would come\nDown yeah chairman Chuck Grassley along with Aaron Orrin Hatch in a couple of other senior Senator Mike Lee from the Judiciary Committee they just gave a press conference what's the message coming from the Republicans right now\nSo they've been briefed on some of them have actually read through as much as they can be forty six pages of new FBI reporting on the background check the updated background check on judge Kavanaugh\nAnd their messages that there is nothing in there that advances or the corroborate a Christine law the Fords allegations or Deborah Ramirez has allegations\nRepublican so there are limited in what they can say because of the all the details and the arrangement about getting this information from the FBI and all the memos of understanding that control what they are allowed to talk about but not supposed to talk about very much but it all\nBut a couple of the senators Republican senators who um\nAnd most of understanding that control what they're allowed to talk about they're not supposed to talk about very much of it at all\nBut a couple of the senators Republican senators who have emerged have actually been quite angry at the at the fact they can't talk about it and say you know I really wish you all can see this you'd see what you see what we see and you would know that this stuff is uncorroborated so very strong from that\nStandpoint a very interesting and and also if you just give us a little background there so people understand why this needs to be kept quiet because when an FBI when you have to conduct a background check for U.S Supreme Court nominee any cabinet official or anybody who requires a background check there are certain rules and protocols that that sort of surrounded that entire\nEndeavor right that's how the FBI is able to conduct the very candid interviews that they conduct\nWho's been tampering with Lindsey Graham's Wheaties what's what's gotten into this guy over the last I mean a lot of people are talking about it he really does seem genuinely transformed by the events that he has witnessed here that\nI don't know that I I don't think that a transfer I I've I've watched one of the grand prix I guess what nearly Eighteen years now and\nHe's always been one of the most intriguing senators up your he's very passionate about whatever he feels\nAnd tea obviously feels passionately and he's the best quote of any senators he is by far the best quote on Capitol Hill\nAnd he's putting them to use here and it's it's it's a it's really interesting to watch them play but we're real quickly though I said the other story\nOn this but I think probably does deserve more attention is the rest of the Democratic staffer last night for a ... being charged with boxing the Republican senators it was a democratic staffer for a congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee who was actually posting this private information of senator and I'm surprised that is not getting more attention\nAnd all you know I didn't know you are on that story as well because I definitely plan on talking about a little later in the program give us the latest on that it was a state for as they keep saying former staff or is it is this a former staffer like ... as of now because this person got caught or had they been a former staffer you know\nSo he he was a former staffer in the Senate and according to the affidavit that was filed this ... this morning in this case he was asked to resign by a senator Maggie Hassan from New Hampshire a Democrat from New Hampshire [noise]\nHe was asked to resign from her office earlier this year and the the affidavit doesn't say what that was about and it'll be interesting to figure out why they ousted him\nHe was apparently scooped up by congresswoman Jackson lead in Texas and you know the our reporting right now is that he was employed up until vis a vis the rest of this week and uh the affidavit actually says that he is not the reason he got caught apparently is that\nHe snuck back into senator Haskins office late Tuesday night like ten thirty at night on Tuesday and one of the other employees another staffer there was like you weren't supposed to be here what you're doing and called the police on him and then they started tracking things back and have a tied him to the dock seeing from uh from earlier from a bunch of different house networks\nIncredible uh area that you're right that deserves a lot more attention and that will certainly try to continue to focus our our light on it Stephen diamond that's and then again this is something you would think that both Democrats and Republicans could join together and condemn because uh the Democrats don't want to walk down this road they don't they don't want staffers doing this kind of thing to them\nOn the other side even done always good to talk to my friend and I keep up the good work you're going to have sadly I think you're going to have to work through the weekend again\nI'll Try and stay away from the ... of the Washington Times how can one rest during a news cycle like this a are more on the scene there the protests that are

methodically if you remember that famous moment when\nUh the late Senator John McCain walked right up and did that thumbs down no vote on repealing Obamacare that was the that was the method of vote and McConnell does that for the purpose that you're saying he wants to make sure that they all see exactly who's voting one way and the voters back home can see it\nOr some people can't hide behind the electronic vote he wants that dramatic moment on camera\nThere was a report this morning I don't know if it's true that mansion had said he was willing to be the fifty first vote if needed and I was wondering how he wouldn't know it was needed or not but now I think I understand\nYeah and that's kind of funny but that that's that's typical Joe mansion because he knows that he's not needed as
