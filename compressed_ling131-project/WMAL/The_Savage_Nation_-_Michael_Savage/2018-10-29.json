while ago at his her a press briefing did she get and the press was exactly how you would expect them to be a cure is a ... opening statement here which was quite good\nIn the wake of the attack we witnessed Americans of every faith and traditions coming together to mourn with their fellow citizens to support one another and to stand in solidarity with America's Jewish community the president cherishes the American Jewish community for everything it stands for and contributes to our country\nCan't doors Jewish Americans as part of his own family\nThe president is the grandfather uh several Jewish grandchildren and\nHis daughter is a Jewish American and his son in law's a descendent of Holocaust survivors [noise]\nTomorrow the president and first lady will travel to Pennsylvania to express that supported the American people angry with the Pittsburgh\nAnd that is the big news item out of this that the president and first lady will be traveling to Pittsburgh for this now uh so you heard that and then from there she took questions and it did get contentious and I play a lot of that for you got to hear going after\nHer a cost of going after her it's unbelievable but I I Want you to hear that so they're done with the press conference after that incredibly emotional powerful opening statement from Sarah Huckabee Sanders by the way the daughter of a minister [noise]\nA daughter of a minister with a as most Christians in America and mostly of Angelica Baptist Christians in America have on ending an unwavering support for the Jewish people in the state of Israel or you can hear her voice breaking think talking about a avant garde Trump and Jared and um\nThen after that entire thing they cut back to book called winning the studio at CNN [noise] and and\nHere's how the media respond immediately after that said but you know they've been dying to have been stripped why doesn't the White House give us an unequivocal statement of solidarity and why can't the red white must the White House continue to drag politics and da da da da da\nAnd so she does she does that just like the president did over the weekend and here's how the media response\nFell flat again we're talking about their standards off the top notch in their than are we just heard from the earth and about the last say that you know she struck the right tone thing is the right word was appropriately and all that and now at the moment the nation angry at\nGrieving oh my word\nIs this enough and then she sat and then she turns to her panel well what do you think guys what do you think ana Navarro what do you think Rick Wilson but do you think folks have is enough\nLet's go to Jim Acosta back in the briefing room and ask him if he thinks it's enough it's not up to you to decide if it's a she was appropriate to use the right\nWord she showed the right emotions but is it enough does it rise to the Brooke Baldwin level at CNN to be enough to bring our country together that\nShot up just for a day shot up\nAnd here's her colleague in the briefing room her CNN colleague\nPresidents out referencing old media he's talking about a\nGrilling an hour and a fake lives that exist in the country in the president's going out\nAll right and then she tried to go on to a gym and needed to have a follow up so he started yelling and I got to talk about that\nThem all out here [noise]\nFor us this morning the fake news review the true enemy the single most soft\nReopen an obvious hostility before\nTo use a true enemy the single most stop\nReopen and obvious hostility\nI'm not going to walk through it less but I think that those individuals probably knows who they are hairdresser\nAnd we have to say really specific to general a broad generalization as a full outlet at times I think there's individuals [noise] ah that the president when the referee\nSay hey hey Sarah I'm trying to be a disgruntled victim here and I just need you to walk down this path with me just say it say say CNN as the enemy of the people because then I can go full Acosta and he wasn't done\nAnd I figured I said you're not going to say for the rivers\nGoing to say the fake news media or the enemy of the people\nYou're going to stand there and saying you to say that there are some journalists some news outlets in this country\nAh should you have the guts to stay which outlets which journalists are the enemy of the people\nShouldn't you have the guts so at the same time they decry the president's language and rhetoric with regard to fake news out but at the same time they claim\nThat the president tweeting out that fake news outlets are the enemy of the people and that they are part of the problem in America today at the same time they condemn the president for doing that he is now asked three questions with incredibly volatile language suggest to you don't have that ...\nHe's begging them to be more explicit in their condemnation\nOf CNN and other news outlets at the same time they think it's atrocious of the president even suggest that there may be enemies of the American people were peddling fake news lies in the American\nUp but uh the journalism industry or he is now demanding\nThat they name names\nAnd Sarah handle the pretty well again\nI think it's a irresponsible a news organization like yours to blame responsibility of a pipe bomb that was not say by the president not just blame the president the blame members of his administration's ah for those heinous acts I think that is outrageous and I think it's irresponsible\nFather had gone so we we had to say the jail and getting a free question\nI had a A R a that she\nGave him three questions actually you know lets them I'm old enough to remember when President Obama called every Republican or his enemy that didn't that didn't seem to rise to the gym it costs to concern level that it [noise] but it's but it's All right this is this is where we are right\nNow in mind meanwhile at the same time the gym it costs to had to have that volatile and the noxious\nExchange with Sarah Huckabee Sanders about what the president said and whether he had the guts to be more specific to actually named the names\nOf news outlet to he believes or irresponsibly peddling fake information out there and passing it off his real news even though we know that ... cost his\nOWN Network has actually had to retract multiple multiple multiple new stories almost had a lawsuit by a Anthony Scaramucci and instead of a lawsuit they ended up firing multiple reporters\nWho reported false information that that doesn't matter set all that aside well all of that is going on and we'll have they're having their exchange\nNone of it changes the fact that innocent Jews were slaughtered in a synagogue while they were worshipping on their Sabbath day\nAnd somehow Jim Acosta has figured out a way forty eight hours later to make this really all about Jim Acosta and\nAnd CNN's entire response to that\nDisplay by their employee is Brooke Baldwin back in the studio\nOkay go flat again was talking about their standard off the top notches there than we just heard from there than it off the top law\nThat day that you know trucks that right town meeting in the right word was appropriately low hell but it ... and now at the moment nation angry at\nGreen thing is it enough you know they don't have me on their panels but if I were on that panel I turn them to I don't know Brooke you tell me what's enough\nWhat would be enough to satisfy you abrupt I'm sure that the president and a miss Sanders are dying to
