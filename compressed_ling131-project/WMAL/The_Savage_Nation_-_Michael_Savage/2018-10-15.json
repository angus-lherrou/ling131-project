he said this about a Robert de leite so he's in Ohio right\nAnd you know when he goes to a certain states they always throw some information up there\nFor the local crowd and he wants to praise Ohio present did you know that the the two states that have brought\nAmerica the most presidents are Virginia of course number one cause she's at the beginning or we had we had Washington we had ... percent we at Madison we had Monroe we got we had a whole load of Virginians there right right right at the start and condition\nBut Ohio is number two Ohio has brought us a heck of a lot of

let me let me read the article maybe the article makes it clear Mr Trump said he thought Dr Ford was treated with great respect I wait a minute\nMr Trump said he thought Dr Ford was treated with great respect and wait a minute\nNow the time to confess let's just put it all out on the table because everyone both both sides of our political um arms here in Washington are asking for more\nDetails we have the Europeans asking for clarity have turkey waiting care because they want to obviously implicate the Saudis and it was on their soil yeah uh and you know I think the the entire Middle East is waiting to see how that emerges\nThere seems to be a very significant drumbeat here in Washington DC to urge the president to take a a pretty firm stance on this or even so far some have suggested that there needs to be some sort of a military statement\nReaction to the Saudi Government over this is that ah even feasible or is it seems like a I mean again not to minimize the deaths of this man and the fact that he was a journalist I'm and I'm you know certainly do make apologies for the Saudi Government but to have a military strike over this seems like a a major overreaction\nOh absolutely and and and as we now this is the Washington politics is basically a referendum on the president's\nA foreign policy towards the middle east and toward to the Saudis ah this is calling into question um all all go as far as to say why did the president pull out of the Iran deal why to view president turned his back on the Iranian regime that's what the\nThe the opposition is truly saying care not because of this one man yes his fiance waiting granted his family's waiting for answers the Washington Post\nIs employers waiting for answers but it is it truly because the rest of the world is waiting nearby to say that there has there has to be consequences to the U.S one burger there are murders every single day and fight Saudi Arabia and Iran and turkey and they're all human rights abuses for people that don't deserve that get put a lot of those murders are\nFor journalists to seek out look at all the newspapers and TV stations that have been shut down in Turkey justice here like the number of journalism bloggers who have been in prison than even hang in there in in Iran I did this regime so I think this is more in an overreaction and again a referendum on the president's policies and that\nPart of the world will end to complicate matters even further we have and we we discuss this in the past a ... year lease enough targets thanks to the Rand nuclear deal thanks to\nA President Trump unilaterally pulling us out of that we have seen a realignment of sorts in the middle east with Saudi Arabia and other nations joining with us and Israel of all countries against Iran\nAnd uh and and this could upset that coalition as well if the president response to these calls for him to take such a strong stance on this\nRight but I I Would I Would urge if I had the president's era what I Would urge you to do and I and I thought this even last year when airline travel to the White House what\nWhat the president needs to do is to almost a play into this well\nYou know rhetoric matters and you know work even if they're not hurting and understood on the other side\nIn in American diplomacy these words that are asked what do I buy that combined there you know the proverbial flop on their wrists with regard to human rights violations who the nation which we we make deals with so if you're talking to turkey and saying you know things are great going forward but I Need to do this\nOr if you're going to be a NATO ally you feel that they were involved in the coalition together against Syria I Need you to do this but I also need to stop and preventing people for no reason I Need you to stop killing\nYou know journalists I Need you to stop rounding up judges and teachers and the officers and he could do the same thing to Saudi Arabia or ... you know I\nI enjoyed and eating and you should writes like Britain should have at least ... listen we've got a fourteen point five billion dollar arm shipments about to go to the Saudis a bunch of fighter jets and and I mean it can't we use a stick with the carrot can't we say listen absolutely\nAnd what does one thing to do with this is what Americans need to understand\nThat that emotion don't to dictate our policy in the middle east what the what dictates our policy in the middle east it's it's our national city it's our ask an evil it's our ability to protect ourselves\nAnd to cut it you know and in this case a very lucrative deals but we're\nWe're gaining economically allocating with with regard to security yeah what what if our feelings are hurt because the Saudis did something to one of their own we could hold them accountable yes we are better than that and that's why you could deliver that slap on the race whether to turkey to the Romney team which we gave billions of dollars to without any slap\nOn the wrist but no one had any problems with that really administered than to say oh even about Americans being held there no nothing no that is very human rights violations\nYeah I mean the truth and even if I can count that no nothing no that is a great time human rights violations that is a great point at the same people who are are are demanding that the president do something to Saudi Arabia right now seem fine\nWith giving billions of dollars to Iran and God Knows they're attracted can you stick with us Lisa 'cause I didn't want to hear what happened at Rutgers University do
