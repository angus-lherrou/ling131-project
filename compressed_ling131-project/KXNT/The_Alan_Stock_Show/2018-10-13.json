how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all

okay that's clean my heater dot com\nHey let's take some time to talk about something that way too many people overlook okay and that's what's in the air in our homes\nYou hear a lot of talk about air pollution and air quality in the environment right but did you know that the environmental protection agency the EPA says that the air in our homes is often more polluted than the air of the largest cities in the United states\nAnd with all the time and energy that we spent trying to clean up the environment to ensure that were breathing clean air\nPeople often ignore their own homes the air and your own home is where we get exposed to things like molds and bacteria and allergens and chemicals so how does the air in our homes get polluted\nWell some of the chemicals that we find in our air are from things like cleaning products underneath your sink plastics look at all this stuff in your house that made a plastic all of that stuff actually off gases or releases chemicals into your air for years\nPaints everybody's got paint on the wall right that stuff off gases that's our they've got the OC free paints nowadays there's glues there's press the woods there's furniture all that stuff made with chemicals in it\nThan there are the molds and allergens that come into our homes from outside through doors and windows and unsealed air ducts and when you go outside mold attaches itself to your clothing\nEven your pets carry mold spores into the house with them okay and the worst part is that it can and almost always does grow in our homes\nAnd most people don't realize that your air conditioner doesn't bring new air into your house but then it just constantly recycles the same old air that's already in your home\nThat means that if there are chemicals and molds and pollutants in the air they're going to just keep re circulating unless you have something in place to remove them\nThey are just magically going to disappear or right\nAnd the air in your home can circulate over a hundred times per day through your air conditioning system which means that all of the pollutants just keep circulating for you and your family to keep breathing in\nThis can lead to major major health problems overtime I said it before and I'll say it again if you don't have a good filter for your air or your air conditioner\nYou become the filter\nThink about that you either filthy\nThere for your air or your air conditioner you become the filter think about that you either filtered the air with your lungs or you get a good filter you choose\nSo let's focus on the molds and the allergens that are found in the air okay 'cause the fact of the matter is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air conditioner\nLast time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens and you can have side effects from them right seven of them are toxic okay so what are the side effects and breathing mold\nObviously everyone's different but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects that we're able to find we're talking about things like upset stomachs weight gain fatigue\nLoss of sleep night sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell auto immune disorders or sexual side effects and let's not forget about depression\nPeople often experience allergy like symptoms not realizing that the air that they're breathing in their homes is the main problem\nSo what are people doing to remove these molds and allergens from the air that circulating over and over and over again in their home while there are a few different methods but the one most common method and the most effective is using ultra violet light okay\nSo let's talk about these ultraviolet light so have you guys heard about these things well the first guy to have a breakthrough using ultraviolet light was Neal's been sitting back in Nineteen oh three and Neal's won the Nobel Prize for his work using ultraviolet lights to treat tuberculosis\nAnd because of Neal Simpsons work ultraviolet light has since become the gold standard and it's used in many different ways in the medical field okay it's used to sterilize the air and hard surfaces and pretty much every hospital throughout the United states\nUltraviolet light is used to sterilize water if you have a well you might actually use it to sterilize the wealth from bacteria there used to sterilize food and for the last twenty five years or so ultraviolet light has been used in residential home heating and air conditioning systems\nWhy because of ultraviolet lights unbelievable ability to destroy the nasty stuff we were just talking about things like molds and bacteria is that take up residence in your home heating and air conditioning system\nGet in on the best offer we have right now we only do this on the radio remember it includes the duct work inspection so grab your pen or your phone and

telephone calls and when you get that telephone call half your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich get richer and\nAs a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay because you're not really getting anything and in some cases they're\nDoing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay if not possible now I'm offering this for Seventy nine dollars today but you only get one shot at it okay at least for the Seventy nine dollars from that point forward\nYou'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll be happy to pay the regular price\nAnd if you get set up on one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts and priorities service almost everybody that we see gets one of the maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter is that everybody and I mean everybody in the Las Vegas area needs this I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil in your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to\nSeem deal folks if you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer if you want to keep the warranty and clean one runs so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all the time my airs blowing a lot harder is that normal well\nYeah we pulled out your blower you had us clean it it was all gone up it should be moving more air\nMy furnishing their conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goal we don't want it to run this much that way your energy bills aren't as high end ... D you middle sized properly or humidifiers properly depending on the season\nSo let's summarize folks real quick so that you know what you're going to get from a company like climate control experts\nThen I'm going to open up the phone lines again and allows some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for Seventy nine bucks and you're absolutely going to love the service I promise I remember I'm going to give you the Seventy nine bucks back\nOn the way out the door actually going to give you your money back\nThen that crazy amazing\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technician to arrive\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let 'em in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat pump\nAnd he'll reached down and put on shoe covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's going to wear those each time he enters your house\nShow you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I see anything that's going to give you challenges in the future I'm In a market in this column over here\nAnd as I'm going through your system I mean they're going to mark okay or if I see anything uh that's going to give you challenges in the future I'm In the market and this column over here\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can\nNow once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice don't ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working next to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit at which point he'll say something\nLike I'm going to start your tune up now if you want to watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext as we get the leaves and sticks in mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and rushed out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of a unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom\nMakes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your ... from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right and it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass\nClippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that going back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test\nThe electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish it can cause big things to go wrong\nAll right you may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started it's about to go bad you may have a pending\nMotor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or from is we'll check the burners\nYour pressure switches make sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right\nWe'll check all your hoses your drains your flame sensor and even run a little test on your ignite or to make sure that it's not about to go out on you when it gets cold All right because of that happens your house is going to

and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe're going to check the temperature difference between the\nThat you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you
