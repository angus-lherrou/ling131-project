E. they've got football they got cheerleaders\nCheerleaders they guy lockers man I if I could get over to middle school I'd be happy then you remember that and that was in middle school I got to be about the ninth grade and I was fourteen Fifteen Years old and one of my buddies got his driver's license\nHave it on one that fall thanks for taking my call\nSure what's\nA few years ago a resigned our children I'm from Florida prepaid college plan and my husband and I were both making more money at that time than than than our income has gone down and we added another child\nAll right that and we had a car loan now and we can take the money out and we have invested over the past three years without penalty should we do that or should we cats path right that can leave that money and continue contributing to their prepaid plan\nHow much is in there\n[noise] um about eighty six hundred\nEighty six hundred dollars and how much do you own your car we have a ten thousand and what do you own your credit cards uh five thousand okay and um are you guys on a budget in reducing debt already\nWe started at ... and that's and I realized that we did that baby steps out of order like having that Peter Pan ... played pan and then I don't know what to do at that point gotcha okay I'm In your household income as well\n[noise] [noise] and my husband ... forty five and I have a small business that brings in about twelve thousand a year\nOkay so about sixty thousand give or take All right um no I Would not casual woods stopped adding\nTo it um and um you do need to get on a budget and follow through with what you're learning in financial ... University in just work your baby steps if you stop adding to it you'll be fine\nThe other thing I probably wouldn't do a new emergency\nOr no rush but sometime in the next year or two I Would probably take that money out of there and roll it into a five twenty nine plan in good mutual funds and here's why\nYou're much better off to save for college in a five twenty nine or an e essay and mutual funds than you are with prepaid college plants here is the reason anytime you're prepay something your rate of return is what it increases in price\nAnd so if I prepay a an item I pay a thousand dollars and increases in price\nTo twelve hundred dollars my rate of return if it did that in one year would be twenty percent so that'd be a nice rate of return right so how much of the increase in price 'cause that's the only return when you ... pay anything they're not giving you an interest rate they're not giving your growth rate you simply are saving the increases in tuition\nBy paying it ahead of time that's all you're doing now\nTuition for the last Seventy years as average about seven point two percent\nInflation right\nSo that means you're making about seven point two percent on your money when you do prepaid college in a good growth stocks mutual fund you ought to be ten to fourteen percent\nAverage annual return over that same period of time minded and so you make more\nBy putting it in and you actually get some headway towards college the other problem with prepaid college is\nA ... and it's a blanket statement but and it would vary from state to state many many many of the state's\nBusiness government are very poorly run and they screw up some of the prepaid college plans and the process I mean they're just horrible administrators\nSome states are well run my state happens to be well run so in the state of Tennessee I wouldn't be concerned today under the current administration\nWith a with the stability of the ... still wouldn't do prepaid college even in Tennessee because of the other reason I was talking about I Want a better rate of return on my money than simply the inflation rate of tuition\nSo all of that to say a row you already six hundred bucks into a five twenty nine and a good mutual fund at some point right now I just stopped adding get yourself on a budget cranky lifestyle down stop going out to eat\nAnd the call to vacation because you're broke and you've been spending more than you make and you have to stop that and that's how you got a car loan and credit card debt so you're right on track you're doing the right kind of things and that's what I Would do if I were in your shoes Matthew is with us in Fort Worth Texas hey Matthew how are ya\nI'm excellent uh want to thank you for ... for a\nA ... I was going to be for the last seven years we paid off over a hundred thousand dollars good for him and would have been in bankruptcy had a had we not gone through a few wow so ...\nTo my question because this is a wonderful thing that's fixing that happened or we were my family my parents have received an inheritance a mineral rights in West Texas mhm a large portion\nAnd uh haven't struck oil a lot of oil we've had it for a hundred years and had a few oils but not not a time mhm uh speculators are wanting to sell a or by our rights for a large sum of money mhm\nUh over a million dollars mhm and we're deciding whether or not we should sell mhm and cash out or hopefully you know we're being told don't sell because there's going to be a boom mhm and we want them out you know large nice inheritance and I want to make sure it's managed properly\nMhm [noise] well there's only a boom if it's not a dry hole\nAnd there's only a boom if after it's not a dry hole there is an actual uh oil prices that sustain a drilling a and and that's one of the reasons west Texas is struggling right now oh prices are so far down\nThat there's no boom okay I mean when gas was five dollars a gallon it was a boom baby I mean but are you doing and could that come back yeah I just probably depends on you know what OPEC does on turning on or off the faucet on the supply demand that's the issue\nAll of that to say I'm no expert on the oil business I don't know much about it at all they get just about everything I Know just in a [noise] but um and so the way I asked myself that question if I'm In your shoes and you might answer the question differently than I Would\nBecause you might know more or your family might know more\nAh oh let me ask you this you have to sell all of them you have to sell all it was an all or none\nNo it's not an all or none ah what do you it's it's essentially a they're looking at the three million for all and uh and uh or you know obviously one point five for half\nOkay so you just add on how one\nYeah and my biggest concern is a risk yeah I mean we are not oil people\nYeah I think on a ... minute as as women I'm ... so you're only talking about selling half\n[laughter] we're deciding on how much to sell\nOkay All right if I were in your shoes I don't know much about the oil business and if someone asked me if I had a pile of money in the middle of my kitchen table that said three million dollars on it when I go by oil rights within my answer would quickly be no\nMainly because I don't like that much risk and I don't know much about that\nOkay those two things would take it off the table for me I Would rather buy something else with it than I that I Know a little bit more about like real estate and it's a little bit more predictable and less risk personally okay\nBut that's the way you ask yourself the question if I had three million dollars by the middle kitchen table would I go go by our rights in West Texas where the if the answer is no then it's time to sell\nFor the same reason I say you know that you wouldn't die and I was actually\nAnd that's that's what I agree with his getting the family to understand that you know when we're afraid the stock market might crash\nIt might but I got to tell you start getting less rock markets less risk than ...\nYeah we're a hundred\nPercent sure that you don't have I mean walking around since tells you that you don't have to be all person to know that now uh so what I Would do a ... the family has to do these are family owned and so you can't just show like yours off\n... uh no this is I'm I'm helping my mother and father and I could just say\nOh I see so it's a just shut down they can make the decision for the whole thing or not yeah All right then if I were in their shoes I Would at least to sell Seventy five percent of it\nOkay I probably would sell at all but on the off chance that they're just dying to be a little bit and they all business and they're scared to death of ... you know they're scared to death that they're going to miss out on something here right and uh you know so that that you\nKnow if it struck out right after I sold it I regretted the rest of my life you know those kinds of statements then maybe keep twenty five percent of it and sell Seventy five percent and then let's buy some real estate or by some mutual funds or something that's a whole lot less risk with that I'm definitely not\nSome advisers that of families entire portfolio three million dollar network\nBe caught up in all that much um\nI wouldn't do that personally and if somebody asked me\nAs a financial coach that they do that I Would say no I was like\nI Would take the majority or all of that money off the tide\nThanks for calling into it [noise] good news to have a blessing like that do\nThis is the Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nAnd our assets have to be large enough that we can accept that thing just sitting there in the months that door weeks that we don't use it\nAnd um but it is in both of those cases there are a very small percentage of my overall met worse and so there are toy\nIt's just a toy that happens to go up in value in both of those cases that's kind of a nice part of the toy but it goes up in value and still has to do the maintenance on it and fool with it yeah you\nKnow going in them you know the the condo though the day we stopped in they're going to get a condo over in March when one of the ball game over there\nAnd that he was out so it was hot air conditioner was out\nSo three hundred dollars later it was fixed but there's always something you know you just figure that's part of the equation when you own property more crap you own more stuff more repairman you have to know [laughter] it just goes with the territory so long as you're going to animal that emotionally\nTo go with it and you're not looking for it to be in a big term investment that you get rich on then you'll be fine\nJamie is with us Jamie is in Alexandria, Louisiana Hi Jamie How are you\nHow they how you doing better than I deserve what's up in your life\nWill miss they at the end of August I'm I have a friend who has been following you and she gave me some information and I had been struggling as a single parent and I just got a new job in the month of march\nAnd I know I'm like I make enough income but it's like I don't have any money left over to ten my groceries or put gas in my car and I work a pretty good ways away from home and I have two boys one in high school who in sports and very active and a\nSon who's in a high and ah he has a lot of things going on as well but\nIt's just everything doesn't balance out I pay my pads and I don't miss Pam I've had and I'm a Christian you know my income is three thousand and everything it's not adding out and\nSo I'm not sure is your house payment I pay for rent okay and how much is your car payment to Ninety two a month okay unless you own a car and they have eight thousand less so\nThat's not bad but you your take home page three thousand is thirty six thousand a year so that means you're probably making about forty five thousand before taxes is on right\nNow and\nGo home at each paycheck is a thousand in something so for the month with a I make my twenty two hundred a month from my job and I get about nine Ninety two and half point Phil about three thousand of my you know I Would do in income\nOr a little over three okay yes uh well you don't have a lot of wiggle\nRoom here raising two boys um\n... but let's just let's stop a second because it sounds like you're paying bills and then trying to eat I Want you to eat and then try to pay bills what that means is is that we need to start start doing a written budget where every dollar but for the month begins you look at your paychecks and what they're going to be you look at\nWhat is going to be for this month before the month begins and you assign every dollar and so we would start with Todd off the top you said you're either med school I'm not the first thing we do take ten percent off okay that tie this done now what are we gonna do next well we're\nGoing to eat so second thing you do\nYou eat so you do your grocery budget and you set that money aside and then what's the next thing you know you pay your life and your water\nOkay then what's the next thing you do you do your you pay your rent guess what after ties food rent and lights and water there's some money left but it's not a bunch\nOkay if you probably got Fifteen hundred bucks left if I did my calculations correct there give or take ... right\nI don't know what you know and they don't even have that much left over food um but you know you probably got twelve hundred maybe but let's just call it a thousand you know after you just your run those actual numbers right down the page child support plus my checks minus\n... minus ah my my a food ... budget whatever shut up for food and a minus ... minus my lights and water\nNow I'm living and I've eaten and the kids have eaten before we do anything else out now we've got a car payment or they're going to report that thing and we've got to put gas in the car now how much is left\nOnly then that we spend money

of the best kept secrets to keep your heating and air conditioning system running like a tough and now here's your host\nLas Vegas gene here with climate control experts thank you so much for tuning into date to learn everything there is to know about your heating and air conditioning system\nWe're going to talk about what to look for in a heating and cooling contractor and then are going to uncover the keys to making that sucker run for ever\nHave you have somebody come out and tell you that you needed to replace your furnace or air conditioning system\nI interviewed a guy one time who said that the company that he worked for required him to try to sell new heating and cooling equipment to customers whose heating and air conditioning systems or two and three and four years old\nOh look I don't care how efficient they claim your heating and air conditioning system is if it's less than eight years old you shouldn't even be having the conversation\nHow about your energy bills do you have energy bills to just keep going up and up and up did you replace your air conditioning system maybe or your furnace and not see the energy savings that you were promised\nI Want to talk to those of you out there who have a furnace or air conditioner or he bumped the six or eight years old and you've been told to junk it in my lifetime I can count on one hand how many six year old systems that I've seen that needed to be replaced\nMost of the time they just needed a really good cleaning it's going to take you years to get your money back out of a new air conditioning system do you have six or eight grand just lying around that you want to Chuck it your heating and cooling system\nWould you rather spend just a little bit of money getting it cleaned up operating more efficiently lower your energy bills viewer breakdowns and more money in your pocket\nNow we're gonna talk a little bit about what you should expect from the heating and air conditioning company that's coming out to maintain your system because I've got a feeling that a lot of you out there have been getting the drive by maintenance\nYou'll recognize it it's the one where they come out for twenty to forty five minutes ask you for fifty sixty Seventy bucks and then they're gone\nMaybe they hook up a set of refrigerant gauges maybe not\nIf somebody's not spending at least Seventy five to Ninety minutes you need to get somebody else\nA climate control experts to not usually takes between Seventy five two hundred and twenty minutes from start to finish now we call that cleaning or tune up a total system rejuvenation\nAnd it includes cleaning your outdoor coils and inspection and documentation of about sixty Seventy different components in your furnace and air conditioner\nSome of your going sixty Seventy different components that is a lot of stuff right\nWell when our guys show up and he spent an average is Seventy five to a hundred and twenty minutes working to get your heating and air conditioning system as close to factory fresh condition as possible not to mention their criminal background checks and drug screen to to\nDid you know that the number one and number two trades being taught in the prisons today we're plumbing and air conditioning\n[noise] that's right folks the number one and number two trades being taught in the presence today are plumbing in air conditioning\nNot listen folks I'm not saying that I don't believe that people deserve a second chance I really do believe that if you made a mistake and you did time for it when you get out you should be able to get a job\nI just decided I wasn't going to put them in your home now fellas if your wife's going to be the one that's on when the heating and air conditioning guy comes by do you want to take a chance that that person is someone who learned heating and cooling in the pen\nDo you have kids how 'bout them did you know the fifty percent of the guys that I have interviewed can't pass a nationwide criminal background check\nFolks I went through over one hundred resumes and a period of three weeks and only hired one person climate control experts they're very selective about who they put in your own\nI Want to talk about one of the gentlemen I interviewed and keep in mind when I Do an interview I asked them all kinds of questions about how they do the work\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI lean in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis year that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all I don't\nWith it at all and the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got a filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all so repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace\nWe'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses your drains a you're a flame sensor even run a little own test they call it on your ignite here because if that little baby goes bad\nIt's gonna get cold in your house in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and delete carbon monoxide DC\nOh why I say that you have to do these two types and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe're going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine\nWe are going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there's if you have them let you know how your filters look and advice you whether or not there's something more time or cost effective\nAt the end of the day

clean my heater dot com\nLet's take some time to talk about something that way too many people overlook okay and that's what's in the air in our homes\nYou hear a lot of talk about air pollution and air quality and the environment right but did you know that the environmental protection agency the EPA says that the air in our homes is often more polluted than the air of the largest cities in the United states\nAnd with all the time and energy that we spent trying to clean up the environment to ensure that were breathing clean air\nPeople often ignore their own homes the air and your own home is where we get exposed to things like molds and bacteria\nSo how does the air in our homes get polluted\nWell some of the chemicals that we find in our air are from things like cleaning products underneath your sink plastics look at all this stuff in your house that's made a plastic all of that stuff actually off gases or releases chemicals into your air for years\nTaints everybody's got paint on the wall right that stuff off gases that's our they've got the OC free paints nowadays there's glues there's pressed woods there's furniture all that stuff made with chemicals in it then\nThere are the molds and allergens that come into our homes from outside through doors and windows and\nUnsealed air ducts and when you go outside mold attaches itself to your clothing\nEven your pets carry mold spores into the house with them okay and the worst part is that it can and almost always does grow in our homes\nAnd most people don't realize that your air conditioner doesn't bring new air into your house but\nThen it just constantly recycles the same old air that's already in your home\nThat means that if there are chemicals and molds and pollutants in the air they're going to just keep re circulating unless you have something in place to remove them\nThey are just magically going to disappear her right\nAnd the air in your home can circulate over a hundred times per day through your air conditioning system which means that all of the pollutants just keep circulating for you and your family to keep breathing in\nThis can lead to major major health problems overtime I said it before and I'll say it again if you don't have a good filter for your air or your air conditioner\nYou become the filter\nThink about that you either filtered the air with your lungs or you get a good filter you choose\nSo let's focus on the molds and the allergens that are found in the air okay because the fact of the matter is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air conditioner\nLast time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens and you can have side effects from them right seven of them are toxic okay so what are the side effects of breathing mold\nObviously everyone's different but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects that we're able if I were talking about things like upset stomachs weight gain fatigue\nLoss of sleep night sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell auto immune disorders or sexual side effects and let's not forget about depression\nPeople often experience allergy like symptoms not realizing that the air that they're breathing in their homes is the main problem so what\nAre people doing to remove these molds and allergens from the air that circulating over and over and over again in their home\nWhile there are a few different methods but the one most common method and the most effective is using ultra violet light okay so let's talk about these ultraviolet light so have you\n... well the first guy to have a breakthrough using ultraviolet light was Neal's fenced in back in Nineteen oh three and Neal's won the Nobel Prize for his work using ultraviolet lights to treat tuberculosis\nAnd because of Neal Simpsons work ultraviolet light has since become the gold standard and it's used in many different ways in the medical field okay it's used to sterilize the air and hard surfaces and pretty much every hospital throughout the United states\nUltraviolet light is used to sterilize water if you have a well you might actually use it to sterilize the wealth from bacteria there used to sterilize food and for the last twenty five years or so ultraviolet light has been used in residential home heating and air conditioning systems\nWhy\nBecause of ultraviolet lights unbelievable ability to destroy the nasty stuff we were just talking about things like molds and bacteria is\nTake up residence in your home heating and air conditioning system and guys mold is bad for you if you didn't get that from what we're talking about before the environmental protection agency says that if you know or suspect that you have mould and your heating and air conditioning system that you shouldn't operate the system\nHere the numbers dial quickly because they go\nI've been up to seven

laughing going what's the drive by maintenance well if you have somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes during a tune up\nFrankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too\nSo what do you want to do if you got one of those companies\nWell I'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you\nAsk them to have the technician give us sixty seconds heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone calls and when you get that telephone call half of your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich get richer\nAnd as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay because you're really getting anything\nAnd in some cases they're doing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible now I'm offering this for Seventy nine dollars today but you only get one shot at it okay at least for the Seventy nine dollars from that point forward\nYou'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll be happy to pay the regular price and if you get set up in one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts and priorities service almost everybody that we see gets one of the maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter is that everybody and I mean everybody in the Las Vegas area needs this I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil and your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to\nSame deal folks if you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer if you want to keep the warranty and clean one runs so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all that time my airs blowing a lot harder is that normal well yeah we pulled out your blower you had us clean it it was all gone up it should be moving more air\nMy furnishing their conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goals we don't want it to run this much that way your energy bills aren't as high end ... D you middle sized properly or\nHi it's properly depending on the season\nSo let's summarize folks real quick so that you know what you're going to get from a company like climate control experts\nThen I'm going to open up the phone lines again and allows some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for Seventy nine bucks and you're absolutely going to love the service I promise and remember I'm going to give you the Seventy nine bucks back on the way\nOut the door actually going to give you your money back then that crazy amazing\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technicians to arrive\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let 'em in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat pump\nAnd he'll reach down and put on she covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's gonna wear those each time he enters your house\nThey'll show you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I mean they're going to mark okay or if I see anything or it's going to give you challenges in the future I'm In the market and this column over here\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can now once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working next to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit\nAt which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and it's not that it's okay to and then\nHe'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext as we get the leaves and sticks and mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and Ross out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely next thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of your unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris\nOut of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right\nAnd it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass clippings in dust and whatnot so we're gonna back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance is right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections\nMake sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nBecause sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish it can cause big things to go wrong All right you may have\nSir failure because you've got a little starter that's about to go bad\nYou may have a\nPending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or from is\nWe'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right\nWe'll check all your hoses your drains you flame sensor and even run a little test on your ignite or to make sure that it's not about to go out on you when it gets cold All right because of that happens your house is going to get cold in a hurry\nMost important ally we're going to check your heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide do you see now why I say that you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe are going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine we are going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there's if you have them let you know how your filters look
