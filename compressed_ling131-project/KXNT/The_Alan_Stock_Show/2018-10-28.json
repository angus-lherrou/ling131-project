Jean\nAnd thank you for coming back to flip district with market Melinda joining us to be a telephone is PJ for as a nationally\nPublished writer and filmmaker of park way of broken dreams about documentary about Marilyn Parkland influence during the nineties welcome to show PJ tells a little bit about this the documentary began I mean I wasn't here during the Ninety other than of course being a tourists but it sounds pretty fascinating what ... what can tell us about it\nYeah you know there were there isn't a\nThe sixties seventies and are by this point if you you know you know being blown up the city had you know grown massively ah in the Nineteen nineties so it was kind of just like the perfect storm do create this uh this really strong culture a on my own Parkland\nAnd by all accounts who were kind of heading in the right direction at that point why around what year was just like Ninety four Ninety five or give give it so\nUh I mean a kind of kind of coming out of the eighties um and going into the early nineties really kinda peaked\nAround Ninety three Ninety four um you know you you know there was just a lot of the independent organic investment in the area um a lot of people just opening coffee shops in record stores and uh you know music shops and there was already a pretty strong like college bar scene\nUm but you know all these things kind of independently a sprung up but they you know ended up creating this sort of\nA you know inter interdependent framework for a very vibrant street scene and really the the the kind of tight and factor for everything was a K U and be\nA which at the time I had an award winning a college radio program and called rock avenue which ran you know\nEvery every night [laughter] it was you know whatever it was like the newest coolest music uh that was out there that was what kind of people heard the first they're drove them into the record stores in ... park way to buy it and then you know drove them into the music venues to you know see the stuff why\nIs it fair to say that kinda Marilyn park right was sort of what was cool in Vegas at that time\nI mean yeah cool cool a very loose definition but uh you know that is where that was the where the art scene was based out of that was the poetry scene that was it was a lot of experimental theater stuff happening I'm you know live music in the bars or you know this was before downtown blew up downtown there really wasn't for the last ten or Fifteen Years\nAnd uh it's it you kind of actually see these shifts to downtown in the late nineties and early to thousands kind of true sucks all the energy away from what was happening in mile apart way or a decade before then\nAnd where were you when all of that so you were we used to me you know be at that time can it can take as to where you fit into all this puzzle\nI was a I was definitely student age uh so I was there I was in the thick of it I got involved in the seem very early on I think I was introduced to it when I was sixteen or Seventeen and a ... it was it was a popular scene with high school kids because you know being in Vegas there's not a whole lot\nFor you to do if you're in that sort of older out adolescent face before you hit Twenty one\nAnd you know going to a place where there's a coffee shop is open until you know one two o'clock in the morning and no one's hassling you to leave and you can just hang out all night and drink coffee and you know meet your friends and you know listen to live music and read poetry like\nThat was like the coolest thing you could do as a kid in Vegas in the nineties and uh that was what I was doing\nThat is where I first got my start playing and bans and you know doing my performance and that was literally were sharp and all my skills as a writer and filmmaker and everything else\nWhere he would say for as the filmmaker of parkway of broken dreams now to do kind of what inspired you to do this I mean it seems like a such a a distinct sort of topic I guess but I wasn't here at that time so it might be something everyone whatever kind of talking about\nWhatever happened to Marilyn parkway kind of that that sort of say\nUm well ... so that that kind of interesting thing is that you know I think it was\nWhatever happened to Marilyn parkway kind of that that sort of say\n[noise] um well ... so that that's the kind of interesting thing is that you know I think it was such a small seen that a lot of people don't know about unless there were there but\nIt had a lot of influence I mean a lot of the ... D jays that we're going to play the strip or you know music executives are bands like the killers all the all these people got their start on Marilyn parkway\nYou know playing in coffee shops or little bars or you know and in a lot of people don't I think you know that because everything's gone there's no physical reminders of these places the places are literally all either either they'd been obliterated\nOr there was something completely different now I'm so part of the incentive for doing it now was to kind of talk to people before they're either not around anymore or um you know have passed on to me a lot of people who are involved in the scene of the time who were in there you know\nForties or fifties now they're up in their sixties and seventies um so you know getting them on camera and getting them to tell their stories but I've been working on this actually for about twelve years I did a a cover story for the Las Vegas weekly back in two thousand six\nUh called dais a future path which was basically an oral history of the period ... and the evidence for that was you and I'll be was starting this midtown you and I'll be campaign\nA kind of a throw some money at the area to help develop it and here we are twelve years later and it still isn't really happening um so I found that really interesting I've really been kind of developing this\nUh you know for for almost a whole amount of time [noise]\nWhat happened so so what happened to wipe out all these businesses that sounds like I mean and this was years before the great recession way you know the Ninety into the nineties what happened\nWell I mean it's it's a variety of things to me first think about the timing or we get to the late nineties\nThe Internet goes from being this this thing that only on nerds and college students used to being the thing that everyone uses to do everything right so people are connecting on line to the needs to be in physical space like a coffee shop or a record store you don't need any more\nPeople are now starting to download music online uh so you know CD sales like a huge hit the record stores take hit 'em at the same time in Nineteen Ninety eight K. you in the polls rocket avenue off the air and goes to an all jazz format\nOr I mean all these things happen all at once you know Starbucks moves in like you basically have kind of the ... the same sort of a mysterious factors that play to help all this stuff yet going in the late eighties early nineties\nKind of flipped on themselves and by the late nineties really through thousands it kind of alters dissipate it you know and didn't go away but a lot of this energy again like a lot of a shift in downtown you know the art factor opened in Ninety eight first friday starts in two thousand two you know within those four years\nYou really start to see everyone and everything kind of shift downtown\nAnd you know what I had this really interesting is they are within a kind of a teaser trailer that you did in two thousand seven which showed the neighborhood and then you kind of ... in in your current your blonde about the film how different it somewhat a band if you would have made it and he doesn't seven\n[noise] yeah I mean it would have been different but I think and the second with the crazy thing is like\nEven even at that time some of the some of the businesses were still holding on a there is still being ... record store which they had actually opened a little later a you know the the big goes that was there was still there um you know but even those things are gone\nAnd a little later a you know the the big Cade goes that was there was still there um you know but even those days are gone now I'm so it's yeah it's it's kind of interesting\nSo Peter wilderness interesting [laughter] so\nI guess that'd be leaving that question of like you know so where are we out with a documentary me and I know it was crowd funded or does it out we watch it was what's the status\nSo uh the California campaign just ended a that was to finish production on the film so I've got about\nA dozen interviews in the hopper ah and I've got you know probably another at least half dozen or to to complete um and then it's editing editing editing so the goal is to\nHave a principle photography done by the end of the year and uh hopefully a a a rough cut that I can at least the start submitting the festival by the spring\nVery revealing so we go in the back yard just as an example and there was about Fifteen dead bird in the background or backyard I'm Sorry just spread out around the back yard notes\nAbout Fifteen dead bird in the background or backyard I'm Sorry just spread out throughout the backyard no train for them you know fall out of and die\nAnd no trees no trees I can already since Nevada is is there anything\nThat I just a massive yard with with dead birds strewn all over it and there were ... that this is so bizarre but there were there would be like like large honeybees\nThat had been that died and they're like they're exoskeleton we're still stuck on the wall of the outside of the house there was like twenty five stuck to the outside of the house just he's clear\nPerfectly formed exoskeleton obese it was just a very strange circumstance right out of the gate throughout the construction process\nI had him out I'm gonna call it four or five of my my contractor my grand diamond flooring guy my painter who\nWere in the house alone doing work and called me the next day and promised me that they would never step foot in the house to get things from hearing noises two doors slamming to\nGates slamming start to just you you name it screen my grand guides or that there was nobody there vocal\nBasement in this house but you practice which if that's not enough in Vegas yeah the basement in Vegas you\nShould have sounded the alarm right there that this was a bad place to be in [noise]\nGranted guys swears that there was a girl screaming downstairs in the basement\nAnd he actually left the house that night and called me immediately and said you will not be back in that house she'll send somebody else to go finish the job\nAnd none of these guys knew anything going into this right you didn't trust with them NO NAME is how I have every night in an eye on on a\nA single person because I I personally don't like kind of spreading that\nIf you read like I I don't like telling the story of the house that I guess because I don't want anybody knowing I don't want\nYou know the granite guy to be a potential buyers Sunday and\nSay hey you know you you may not want to take a look at the fun somebody killed me no one had any clue to any of the happy they didn't know that history it was just calling me that had\nNever again you can find somebody else to finish the ... I'm not that we put back in there\nI should also say that throughout the process this was probably the hardest house that I'd ever done in my life just little things going wrong\nI had I had a ... year yes flooding you finish the floor of Iraq two weeks from region and the the wood floors that we had laid down have somehow completely bunk I mean like\nLike they were sticking their was bored sticking up from each other not just you know all those little waves here and there there was physically board that popped out ...\nThat had already been installed and they all down and they they hopped down the little things like that along the way fireplaces falling out of the wall and shattering on the floor yeah lower the floor buckling\nJust you name it it happened in this house it it was about should have been a four month job and it took me almost a year and it just because of little things like that that were happening along the way\nIt was there's something about a a mask that was left behind or something like that to some to demand [laughter]\nYeah that was actually night on who the person that I kind of skip that part because it just really creepy an almost embarrassing but but the guy who own the house would committed suicide was buried in to Halloween for which is what later told me by the neighbor that he used to just go all out the house\nDecorated you do a haunted house inside the neighborhood would be able to walk through\nThe neighbor that he is to just go all out\nHow to be decorated you do a haunted house inside the neighborhood would be able to walk through\nIt was really really all about Halloween\nWhen we bought the house my business partner was the first one in it\nHe had gone in about a day before I got\nBack into town and was able to walk it and when he went in there he found a life size\nI mean the thing was probably seven foot tall kind of a a\nA Google with the\nThe big mask on and it was a scarecrow that had to black cloth direct draped over it and like a creepy mask on his crime was the prompt that he would use during Halloween what my partner\nThought that it would be comedic to leave it in the full year of the house as soon as you walked in so we go back to when it took me five minutes to get into the house to crawl through bushes and I live I mean I'm chopping down branches and breaking them off I finally get through the gate I open the front door there's\nOne light on in the house which of course the shining straighten them on on this league\nProp laying on the ground and my I I Know I think I jumped back about twelve feet\nStraight back to the main gate pulled my night that in my pocket\nLike I was actually going to do something with it yeah I'm I'm I'm\nWielding my night that go back in the house and then lo calling\nIt the ... and I should that should have been like indicator number one but this was just going to be a bad time\nThat was a a nice little prank slash\nPremonition leading into everything else that happened without\nConsidering everything else that happened in the house that that could actually be you know that'd be real yeah I mean I get a hearing all this new like yeah that that's real no\nThey're all I Know I could I could look back and nothing could have disappeared in and it could have been an actual non profit that real life creepy goats I was telling me something to talk my tail between my legs and run\nAnd then we probably should have done we've got about forty five seconds a poll but now remember and if I remember there was a safe those left behind you were to terrified to open is that right\nThere was a refrigerator that were left behind which ironically that the rap story up the refrigerator ended up\nBeing taken by one of my contractors to the next how\nThat I was unaware of I didn't know him from the haunted house and I promise you the second part of the house that I had all my issue with\nWas that house that that refrigerator and up and I took that refrigerator after that happened after I learned that you brought it from the haunted house\nI build it up with concrete and I took it to the dumb Indian point California and I picked it out of the back of my truck and we haven't had any issues than\nThat is a story that the gentleman Mike yeah oh yeah that was why ...

never edited so we never have a post show conversation about oh that was out of context or this and that the context as always exactly as it is\nJust putting that out there where we did a pizza diner we've been here before Marcy Kaptur was our guest over here\nIt's a hard a little kind of a very quaint fun little diner right on Capitol Hill our guest this week the air force secretary Heather

America after the war there was no work in Scotland and uh so he was an immigrant came to Boston and started flying in New England opening little airports and being a barn Stormer\nFlew in the second World War for the United states for his new country and uh\nAnd then my dad started flying when he was Thirteen and enlisted in the year ... yeah yeah he traded his services as aligned boy for flight lessons yeah and then ah he and those who are willing to ride a bike around that time he's flying airplane he got his gotta sly license on his sixteenth birthday wow so\nThen he uh he enlisted in the air force he's a crew chief so he was a he was a maintenance guy and then when he got out of the service so that would have been after World War two before Korea um he uh he married my mom who is this high school sweetheart\nSo in the Nineteen fifties when a lot of women didn't even drive he taught my mom how to fly and then after they rebuilt airplanes together and um my dad was a commercial pilot and then um and I gave him a burgeoning industry I mean that was yeah yeah I mean these and say okay let's let's do the pun here it was just getting off the ground yeah All right\nBut then when I was a junior in high school they open the air force academy to women and logical apply that was well it's a pretty big deal my my dad died when I was young but my grandfather is still alive so here's one of the guys who and growing up you were fascinated by plane by planes and and and really inspired by my my\nLady you can call you're canine friend anything you want those are the rules\nRules rules

[noise]\nYes news radio [noise] looking back I mean if you're on the air\nOfficer Heather Wilson as our guest is our wages fuel approach right now because we're going to order I'm really how's it going to drive yeah she was a combination pleased with you yes\nMadam Secretary of love seeing the board of saying the you've got a special at soup and a grilled cheese sandwich yeah excellent thank you so um let's talk about the space wars we've got a couple of guests on this program or ... administrator Neil DeGrasse Tyson\nWorld renowned astrophysicist that's probably a fascinating it was\nSo civil conversation about the universe you'll ever enjoy oh my gosh I'm so I'm going to play for your soundbite from uh your boss secretary of defense Jim Mattis this August thirteenth twenty Eighteen topic spaced forest Eli that's number one\nI I was not a guess what I Would guess rugby do that for five votes so we had to do a lot of work do you want to be\nAll right that's the defense secretary talking in general about the space ... Jim ... administrator knew the grass Tyson and said there is an issue that has to be reckoned with space is a hostile place their interest in equities United States has ... involved in our daily lives GPS all sorts of other things\nAnd yeah it's a I Want to read something to you I'm sure you're familiar with this October force this month foreign policy I Will read the leap paragraph to\nUS President Donald Trump is peeved with air force secretary Heather Wilson over her handling of his directive to stand up a separate space force in the U.S military and he's considering ousting her after the midterm elections\nResources with knowledge of the matter told foreign policy can you respond to that well when when the White House denied it my husband was very disappointed [laughter] okay\nWhy he was opening the terms you get you back or as well yeah I have a a ... more normal normal life yeah yeah no it let me talk about where we are on\nThe space for a first of all I I I Am completely aligned with the president and he set out a very bold vision we have to do and here's why here's the problem that that that Secretary Mattis talked about that we're trying to address the United states built\nA glass house in an era before the existence of stone in other words in space we we are the best in the rural space we're and our adversaries know it\nAnd they are seeking to develop the capability to denying his use of space in crisis or war\nSo think about what that means what we do in space today there's not a military mission did need that in some way by space you have Seventy seven satellites a little less than half of them are GPS so the the blue dot on your phone is provided courtesy of about forty ... air force base in Colorado\nRight by the uh the timing signal for the New York stock exchange comes from those satellites\nWe do communications we do whether ah we do command and control so connecting the president United States to his forces in the field all over the globe\nAnd uh we do missile warnings so on CBS News when they show that arch of you know a missile launch from North Korea it in that comes from the air force we gather intelligence we gather intelligence take pictures listen\nSo all of those are really important missions\nAnd ... and she'll probably the last decade or so we were not really worried about what other countries might do to either jam or knock down our satellites\nIn two thousand seven the Chinese launched a missile and destroyed on orbit one of its nose dead weather satellites the grass Tyson and your bread stand both tossed out that on this very program so so the world has changed and we need to develop the capability and to point the ability to defend what we have on orbit\nAnd to prevail in space so that adversaries won't seek to deny us the use of space and in crisis for war few ... that's the problem we're trying to south\nYou have any reason to believe the president is peeved with you know no I I was with them on friday right are you ... with him no okay [laughter] what what accounts for this representation that there is ...\nI I was with them on friday right are you ... with him no okay [laughter] what what accounts for this representation that there is some distance between you and the president on space for\nA ... I have no idea I mean I doesn't which was a foreign policy article I wouldn't um I I I wouldn't put our our our people trying to undermine you I I have no idea I mean I this is not a game that I play I my job is to try to make sure that the president's intent is carried out and to do it exceptionally well\nWhen ... was on the program he spoke to this issue not only from his perspective is the current NASA Administrator but as a former member of Congress as you were that's one part of your biography we left out longtime serving member of a New Mexico's first district which I'm Glad you did you know it ruins my credibility whenever\nI talk to you that you know [laughter] and all these other southern kind of thing it's like um\nBut she said one of the issues that has to be resolved days there is a part of the air force that does study and work on these issues and it's an important part of the air forces\nAnd don't ... I may I may start mission yes a command control and other things and if you set up a space force than you than ... by nature are setting up another command structure another command bureaucracy for justice one issue and is that the best way to do it is that the most effective way to do it\nThese are legitimate questions even he said so 'cause he's obviously as a civilian space has been a straight or doesn't have a bureaucratic dog in this time but some of the what describes my artist with some of the equity fear involved in some of the underlying questions Jim Mattis was getting out and that you have to reckon with us air force are\nWell that's the challenge of course is the threat that we face in space and they were I think there's broad consensus that we need to go back to something we used to have which was the unified command so Army Navy air force and unified command reporting directly to the sect F\n... for space right now space comes under a Strategic Command\nAnd there is a pretty good argument that it needs to go back to being a tone unified command and so we have a unified command in central command we have a unified command first Strategic Command we have a unified command for the Indo Pacific and uh we used to have one in space it was it was a\nIt was ... after nine eleven when the real focus of the world changed towards countering violent extremism right\nAnd the national defense strategy guides us and explicitly recognizes\nThat we have returned to an era of great power competition and we must who you focus our efforts what are the great powers were competing with well China and Russia but I think in the short term rushes is a it is a threat in the longer term China is innovating faster and it's set out strategic objectives to become\nA major military power by twenty fifty\nAnd that includes space it does okay so with the air force be weaker if there was a space ...\nNo I don't like the the organizational structure to me they should you know form follows function\nI we should ... in my focus is on how do we develop the capabilities to prevail in space and ensure that we have that capacity um the the ... the organization chart is lesson is really\nWhat is it because it it strikes me and look I have not spend a lot of my career at the Pentagon I spent some of my career there a couple of years but\nUh there's there's always kind of a friendly rivalry I think it's a competitive thing in the U.S about the services and this is an area of expertise longstanding within the air force I Would have to think just institutionally it'd be like we can do this we got this well I mean I we need another thing with another\nPatch and another part of the Pentagon we can do this there are a lot I think there's an inclination they're forced to say we can do this well\nI mean we need another thing with another action another part of the Pentagon we can do that there are a lot I think there's an inclination they're forced to say we can do it well we do the right to have that in the fifties the question is do you organize it in a different way given the emergence of a new threat to the new set of circumstances\nAlso thinking it's interesting that that you talk about inter service rivalry the relationships out ladies are much secretary I'm\nThe relationships at the moment when services are exceptionally good the\nThe three of us get along and like each other we actually have breakfast together and we're working a couple of dozen issues together all the ... at the same time um I we also have started we go to each other's homes for dinner about once a month with our spouses so there's a\nThere is a really close working relationship with the services and I think part of what has changed in two thousand sixteen and two thousand Seventeen a lot of authorities that had been pulled up into the\nThe defense agencies and the defense logistics agency or acquisition um had been pushback services so the services are exercising a lot more authority than they were even\nAnd by December this year we will be back to either so so we will now there'll be very young and then it's about training and seasoning those maintain urge to make sure that they they have the skills they need to be craftsman at their work\nI was sitting around a face the nation panel a year ago when David Martin who you very well know national security courts correspond extraordinary CBS News\nUh mentioned an anecdote when you first became air force secretary and were briefed on readiness ... and he said you looked at as well just can't possibly be accurate\nI thought they had the columns we're ... we can't read this you'll prepared with this bill fitted for our readiness mission and you look around and said get me the right now and said no that is the right number ... explain that level of surprise and what you thought was\nWhen I was a young officer in Europe so during the Cold War we had to be ready for the at that time the Soviet Union to come across the fold the gap at any time and so we had very high levels of readiness but we weren't taking parts of those units sending them halfway around the world to you know fight against violent extremism and then bring them back\nAnd expect them to still be ready\nFor the for the conflict in Europe so as we do know exactly so what happens is is Eunice become less ready for all of their operations and uh and uh that's really what's happened over time so so job one for the air forces to restore the readiness lethality of the force\nEven things like munitions\nWhen we were fighting against ISIS destroying their their declared Calif it and we were using a hundred and fifty or so precision Munich missions a day to destroy 'em destroy ISIS uh we were not buying munitions fast enough to replace those we were using so we've we've fix that so told my audience\nJust these ... you said you've got the columns reverse what were you looking at what did you mean but what what did you find it actually meant\nUnits report their readiness and that's readiness for all of their different missions and um and so you'll have a a a readiness metric on you know eighty percent of your units are ready for all of their missions or whatnot and and uh\nAnd I actually thought the columns were reversed ... because it looks so bad well because they weren't all ready for every mission that they had been assigned which is not to say they wouldn't go that the ... being not ready for all your missions doesn't mean we won't go right\nYou know I mean David Margolis come back we'll come back that's right and ... and that's what is that that that that's the most meaningful aspect of this ... this you can do the mission but we wanted somebody to come back as well as we want to win fast and we want everyone to come home again where's that ready to metric now\nWell we are Fifteen Percent more ready today than we were two years ago and Seventy five percent of our operational squadrons\nAre a ready with their first for force pack packages so so ah we're we have turned the corner\nAnd uh we are of we are working a working diligently on both readiness lethality\nReading this and lethality so a three hundred and twelve operational squadrons usa three to six is the necessary goal to fulfill the national defense strategy obviously mathematically you could do the math how far we are a way but in terms of years and actual fulfilling on how far away\nSo the study that we were asked to do looks out to twenty twenty five twenty thirty timeframe 'cause it's it's not supposed to be a moment in time today it's supposed to look out to the future I and to say what would you need at moderate risk given the projections of the threat at that time to be able to implement the national defense\nTo say what we do need at moderate risk given the projections of the threat at that time\nTo be able to implement the national defense strategy the difference between and I were not naive about where the money would come from for this and the other challenges that we face I I worked on Capitol Hill and understand those trade offs but we were asked\nTo say that the air force in had historically than saying All right if this is the money we're giving here as the euro force we would build for that amount of money because now we're being asked and had been asked what is the air force you need to execute the strategy when you're giving it to a different question\nYes and it's I Believe the president's game and desire to give you and the other services the money necessary for the air force or service unique\nThe ah the increase and the certainty that we've gotten over the last two years if that has been tremendously helpful this the first year in where decades I think now\nThat you're a force and the other services have had a on appropriations bill so we've we've actually started the year with the budget right and that's a big deal\nAnd we're going to get to the other on the other side of this right we're going to talk about it it sounds like a lofty subject it's not it's really important predictability and spending

you but you got to be the first person okay that's clean my heater dot com\nLet's take some time to talk about something that way too many people overlook okay and that's what's in the air in our homes\nYou hear a lot of talk about air pollution and air quality and the environment right but did you know that the environmental protection agency the EPA says that the air in our homes is often more polluted than the air of the largest cities in the United states\nAnd with all the time and energy that we spent trying to clean up the environment to ensure that were breathing clean air\nPeople often ignore their own homes the air and your own home is where we get exposed to things like molds and bacteria and allergens and chemicals so how does the air in our homes get polluted\nWell some of the chemicals that we find in our air\nAre from things like cleaning products underneath their sank plastics look at all the stuff in your house that's made a plastic all of that stuff actually off gases or releases chemicals into your air for years\nPaints everybody's got paint on the wall right that stuff off gases that's our they've got the OC free paints nowadays there's glues there's pressed woods there's furniture all that stuff made with chemicals in it\nThen there are the molds and allergens that come into our homes from outside through doors and windows and unsealed air ducts and when you go outside mold attaches itself to your clothing\nEven your pets carry mold spores into the house with them okay and the worst part is that it can and almost always does grow in our homes\nAnd most people don't realize that your air conditioner doesn't bring new air into your house but then it just constantly recycles the same old air that's already in your home\nThat means that if there are chemicals and molds and pollutants in the air they're going to just keep re circulating unless you have something in place to remove them they are just magically going to disappear right\nAnd the air in your home can circulate over a hundred times per day through your air conditioning system which means that all of the pollutants just keep circulating for you and your family to keep breathing in\nThis can lead to major major health problems overtime I said it before and I'll say it again if you don't have a good filter for your ...\nThis can lead to a major major health problems overtime I said it before and I'll say it again if you don't have a good filter for your air or your air conditioner you become the filter\nThink about that you either filtered the air with your lungs or you get a good filter you choose\nSo let's focus on the molds and the allergens that are found in the air okay 'cause the fact of the matter is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air conditioner\nLast time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens and you can have side effects from them right seven of them are toxic okay so what are the side effects and breathing mold\nObviously everyone's different but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects that we're able if I were talking about things like upset stomachs weight gain fatigue\nLoss of sleep night sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell auto immune disorders or sexual side effects and let's not forget about depression\nPeople often experience allergy like symptoms not realizing that the air that they're breathing in their homes is the main problem\nSo what are people doing to remove these molds and allergens from the air that circulating over and over and over again in their home while there are a few different methods but the one most common method and the most effective is using ultra violet light okay\nSo let's talk about these ultraviolet lights have you guys heard about these things well the first guy to have a breakthrough using ultraviolet light was Neal spin sitting back in Nineteen oh three and Neal's won the Nobel Prize for his work using ultraviolet lights to treat tuberculosis\nAnd because of Neal Simpsons work ultraviolet light has since become the gold standard and it's used in many different ways in the medical field okay it's used to sterilize the air and hard surfaces and pretty much every hospital throughout the United states\nUltraviolet light is used to sterilize water if you have a well you might actually use it to sterilize the wealth from bacteria there used to sterilize food and for the last twenty five years or so ultraviolet light has been used in residential home heating and air conditioning systems\nWhy because of ultraviolet lights unbelievable ability to destroy the nasty stuff we were just talking about things like molds and bacteria is that take up residence in your home heating and air conditioning system\nGet in on the best offer we have right now we only do this on the radio remember it

maintenance well if you have somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes during a tune up frankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too so what do you want to do if you got one of those companies\nFrankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too so what do you want to do if you got one of those companies well\nI'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you\nAsk them to have the technician give us sixty seconds heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone call and when you get that telephone call half of your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich get richer\nAnd as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay\nBecause you're really getting anything\nAnd in some cases they're doing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible now I'm offering this for Seventy nine dollars today but you only get one shot at it okay at least for the Seventy nine dollars\nFrom that point forward you'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll be happy to pay the regular price and if you get set up in one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts and priorities service almost everybody that we see gets one of the maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter is that everybody and I mean everybody in the Las Vegas area needs this I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil in your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to\nSame deal folks if you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer if you want to keep the warranty and clean one\nRuns so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all the time my ears blowing a lot harder is that normal well yeah we pulled out your blower you had as clean it it was all gone up it should be moving more air\nMy furnishing their conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goals we don't want it to run this much that way your energy bills are inches high\nEnd ... D you middle sized properly or humidifiers properly depending on the season so let's summarize folks real quick so that you know what you're going to get from a company like climate control experts\nThen I'm going to open up the phone lines again and allows some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for Seventy nine bucks and you're absolutely going to love the service I promise and remember I'm going to give you that Seventy nine bucks back\nOn the way out the door actually going to give you your money back then that crazy amazing\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technician to arrive\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let 'em in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat part\nAnd he'll reached down and put on shoe covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's gonna wear those each time he enters your house\nThey'll show you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system\nHe enters your house they'll\nShow you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I mean they're going to mark okay or if I see anything or it's going to give you challenges in the future I'm In the market and this column over here\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can\nNow once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice don't ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working next to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit\nAt which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext as we get the leaves and sticks and mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and Ross out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right and it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass clippings in dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system\nIt's just like having a sweater on that baby\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance is right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish\nIt can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little starter that's about to go bad\nYou may have a pending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or from is we'll check the burners\nYour pressure switches make sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right\nWe'll check all your hoses your drains you flame sensor and even run a little test on your ... to make sure that it's not about to go out on you when it gets cold All right because of that happens your house is going to get cold in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check your heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide DC\nWe're going to check your heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide DC now why I say that you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe're going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine\nWe're going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there is if you have
