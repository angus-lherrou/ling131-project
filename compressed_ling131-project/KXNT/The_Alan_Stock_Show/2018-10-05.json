fought the card jak off but the guy shot or in the leg Seventeen year old girl and he wound up getting the car they found the car and a shopping center of my my ... and all that stuff I mean the thing was kind of a\nConvoluted cargo well I mean we believe so now come out ... said that the uh the girl was shot in the leg well guess what it was not a carjacking it was\nA drug deal gone bad yeah\nSo I'm not a big big big huge ... drug deal that went wrong\nCar was recovered no arrests have been made girls exact condition is a condition is unknown at this time I'm sure she'll survive like that man\nThat is a big change from what I originally people thought All right or something else I Want to share with you and we can be does it up day because we talk\nFrom what uh originally people thought\nAll right as many as I Want to share with you and we can be is it a day because we talked about this as well there are problems that are going on in the hundreds circle park area in downtown Los Vegas number the lady who was eighty years old live near the ... is in July\nAnd uh she lived through the park\nAnd the guy broke into her home and raped her and then shot or in the face remember that but she survived all of that\nTurned out that the suspect was a homeless guy\nAnd people living near the park are very upset about what's going on and they want something done about the homeless population in the crime the homeless folks are breaking into homes breaking into cars and all that kind of stuff\nThis is um they they've got to deal with it right now what were they decide to do something about it and they've actually close the park down for maintenance and improvements from October forth that would be today through November the thirtieth\nNow we have had people I'm Talking about what they're going to be doing with that park and some of it is going to it's going to be impossible for anyone to sleep there I mean they're going to be putting enough shrubbery and in the light that no one will be able to actually sleep in the park itself so long and becoming can't win for homeless\nLet me just reiterate that the former mayor\nOscar Goodman had the right idea and I went along with that a hundred percent\nAnd that is they should not if that was the homeless encampments that are allowed in the downtown area which they do allow right now this is an obscene it's absolutely obscene and they should have a long time ago turned\nThe um former women's prison in gene into a homeless encampments and shuttle people down there allow them to stay there and get themselves\nUm fixed up and um you know get\nTheir resumes together whatever they had to do get them off drugs off Alcoa whatever the case was but it should have been done in the confines of the of the facilities that exist in gene if they're sitting there fallow right now doing nothing at all\nAnd we we could have had that down and the purpose of that would have been to have them all in one area and deal with all the problems right then and right there and have allowed downtown Las Vegas to be cleaned up\n\nAnd said ah as you well know the day after the mayor made the statement on the show what happened\nWhat happened all of a sudden headlines in the paper ... wants to set homeless the prison I remember I mean there was the next day after he did the show and talked about on my show all of a sudden they wanted to send a homeless to prison he never said that\nYou said rehab v a\nFormer women's prison in in gene into a homeless facility where we could take care of people\nThere's nothing like that right now and they're allowing people to become part of this encampment that they've encouraged in downtown Los Vegas because they have one and so we're in Texas to I'm not sure what a God and so they're going along with this program\n\nThis is a ... they're not going to take care of the problem you know because what they're doing is they're just allowing people to uh keep the downtown area in\nCare of the problem you know because what they're doing\nIs they're just allowing people to keep the downtown\nArea in in complete disarray some of the areas ... downtown real life but with the homeless live ... that whole area terrible terrible and there's no one that I Know that would open any kind of business down there\nAnd that's part of the part of the problem\nBecause they can't develop the area because we've got so many homeless down there\nSo they were uh in camping out a hundred circle park and causing problems down there now the folks and with the silly counsel in the city of Las Vegas decided to go ahead and close it down and maintenance improvements rehab\nFor today is through November the thirtieth All right we'll see if that has any impact or not\nWe'll see I Would say ... ... ... it may may or may improve the hundred circle area they may\nBut it's I don't think it's going to improve um a skin improve the homeless problem overall I just don't believe that\nThere are seven three three cats and two seven three three five nine six if you want to comment on that and I still think it's the best idea that we could have had an Oscar was right on the money when it came to that stuff\nVery much though too badly vilify them really too bad\nAll right we're going to happen over the news trafficking whether together we still have some things to give away moody blues tickets coming up at five\nForty eight and that'll be a very ... to give those away a and then the editorial in this morning's RJ that some thoughts on that\nBecause we had to another huge problem right here in our own backyard and again it it hasn't gone away and I don't think we'll at this point either city's coffers through or to\nYet I Do that yes the answer was yes All right fine Dan you're on kicks in the welcome\n... it was it was a lucky stroke I throw you in today I've had a business downtown for twenty three years next month will be my last month wow I have I Am just done with the home uh I have gone to the city council the city council and\nFound a metro and they all tell me being homeless is not a crime but I've had so many property crimes against my businesses where they stole stuff broke it in came in ... tried to strong arm Rob my secretary I Can't handle it anymore\nSo you're going to you after the next month you're calling it quits\nI I'm yeah I'm going out to green valley actually\nWow yeah I I I don't understand why I mean it's not a crime I get it it's not a crime but it becomes a white it's a blight on the downtown area\nAbsolutely and if you go around it downtown or go round the Justice Center in the mornings you know where they have the benches for everybody said the all loaded up with people homeless people that have it's not just in a cabinet that stand out for formats or it's down right in front of the courthouse\nAnd metros given a directive they can't do anything about it by the city attorney\nOh boy well you know and I'm going to tell you right now it's not going to encourage people to go to the downtown area they want to do that I Know and I know Sunday the north side of the of the freeway but you're right though they'll they'll form asked at\nAll it's all over downtown so it's so it's south of the freeway also\nOh absolutely I I'm a casino center and a Charleston a boy or my officers now I have people I came

that the Ninth Circuit court of appeals said it's not even a crime that sleep in public like that\nWow are you going to be used to be a crime to become San Francisco that's what we're doing and you

I think is driving a lot of business away from the downtown area and you heard one gentleman call and a Dan he's been listening and he says he's a moving business the green valley and I don't blame and I don't want downtown to become a blight\nBut they've got to do something about this now there are other issues going on with Las Vegas and I've got to mention this also because Las Vegas either spending a ton of money on this and this is absolutely ridiculous and you would think that cooler heads will prevail and I ... maybe not\nThe editorial this morning's RJ took at the task Las Vegas

nomination to the Supreme Court thank you Susan Collins and Jeff Flake and Joe mansion with all of that happening\nOr you have to ask yourself how all this affecting the president you know and his and his standing with with what's going on in in America\nI Want to say something or actually is standing is very good and a part of the reason is good is because the economy is doing well\nLet me give you the secretly fifty one percent of likely voters approve of President Trump's job performance fifty percent forty eight percent disapprove that is Trump's highest presidential approval index rating since early March of last year twenty Seventeen\nNearly a year and a half ago\nFifty one percent giving him a positive approval rating you have to ask yourself I mean with all this going on shouldn't be will be happy the unemployment rate\nUnemployment rate hits the lowest level since Nineteen sixty nine\nYou want to know what I'm saying Brock Obama but he did nothing\nSince Nineteen sixty nine\nSo this guy is is doing something not only right\nBut believe me uh it's him pressing the American populace because people are saying I like it I think he's doing the right thing I have more money in my pocket I don't have to work two and three jobs doing much better than I was before before he took over\nSo\nKnow we've had a huge change in what's been going on as a result partially of the presidents and partially a as a result of a people being smart\nBy the way uh all of this and I'm Talking about could wind up being a great great asset for the GOP in mid term elections\nThe voter interest among Republicans and conservatives is now increased substantially\n\nIt's galvanizing conservative voters all this stuff that's been going on about Kavanaugh and all the lives and the un and the and the efforts to take him down and you know make miss me out of him ... believe me it's working against the Democrats\nAgainst them in the past eleven such midterm seizes new presidents southern party make gains only once in the house four times in the Senate zero times they would throw a contests\nBut they're saying actually that the twenty Eighteen mid term elections coming up the trend that's going on right now I could wind up bucking that particular trend at least in the Senate\n\nThe reviews that have come out of his cabinet and not bribery allegations and yet some people will continue to widen moaning grown\nAnd as this has happened as a a he appeared before the Senate Judiciary committee as the information came out that there was ... there were discrepancies in her testimony and that in fact there were certain aspects where she actually to hide\n\nYou have to say to yourself you know what this is a we're heading in the right direction\n\nRight seven three three

say I'm driving my son down to get his car and we're going down Fifteen and every other\nSign we're hiring or hiring you're absolutely right on this and my son is unemployed and we're going down and I said look at all is higher and higher I said if you don't have a job in thirty days I'm kicking you out of the house\n[noise] wow I'm ... ... people are hiring left and right and\nYou know as as a ... tough love I Bob I have a lot of respect for you and I'm Glad that you are seeing those signs as I've seen them too and so everyone else people are hiring left and right\nAnd if that was not the case if I was lying about this the unemployment rate would be much higher but it's the lowest since Nineteen sixty nine\nThat wasn't the Republican Party that put out that's the government figures themselves\nYou're near a hundred percent right I think everything in it and and you know we talk about this all the time Democrats how do you know why bigger paychecks how do you want less taxes why do you not walk on my own money in your wallet I don't understand what are they thinking\nNo forget who was Bill Maher who made the statement that he'd rather have a recession and that people are unemployed and laid off in order to be able to get a Democrat elected of course he can say that because bill Marr has\nMillions and millions and millions of dollars but he doesn't care about you your son or me or any of us so it's easy for him to say that\nBut but most people I think appreciate the fact that this is why the president's rating is fifty one percent the highest it's been in a year

I Hope you believe this there was not one single document presented not one document twenty days\nYou wrote it is very troubling that are ... gas did not have the documentation readily available during my onsite audit which suggests to me that sell those gas either is very haphazard with our regulatory artist to operate has inadequate a turtle processes and documentation or\nOr it was intentionally making the process is difficult to frustrate the investigation\n\nSo he also said it appeared the company was not expecting that the six hundred ... a plus million in capital costs it's

five bucks\nWhy don't you go to a taxi or ... or anything like that why didn't you that's what he is investigating size was gas wants to raise your rates the pay for their homes their consultants frivolous expenditures and even employ massages\nAnd you've got to ask yourself or they freaking kidding me they're not they really do want you to pay for uh for some of these things\nFortunately we
