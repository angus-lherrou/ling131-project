top of the border and if these ten thousand illegal immigrants get do America's border they will be met he says he's not afraid to send the U.S military to secure\nOur border now my question for you or somebody said that's just too extreme that's that's too extreme of an idea that the president should not be saying that we would greet mothers\nAnd children this way that they that we would not treat them a with our military getting in their face All right let's go to your phone calls one eight hundred for seven for nine seven three two one eight hundred for seven for\nNine seven three two and see what you think about this let me go to Terry thinks are wedding you're on the bench Ferguson show Hi Jerry go ahead\nYes Hi this and I agree with a lot of your callers this is definitely an invasion and if we allow this government to go through we're opening the door for a lot of them for any of that much to go through um they are being told that they are going to get free housing\nUm they are being told that they are going to get free housing\nFree food free education whatever it is needless to say in their countries the money that we're sending is going to the government and not to them so I Do understand why anything would feel much better than what they are leaving right now at their respective countries\nFor police ah we we cannot allow this\nBecause there are others who have been waiting for years and the surf to be heard there are people here that have been here for years\nThat have abide by our laws and that for one reason or another\n... uh qualify for um a particular immigration a low and become arrested and an eventually a citizen and do some people who have businesses and we'll have been here for some some of them more than Twenty years\nThis other individuals we don't know who they are you clearly see they are men uh uh the reason they are being paid because they don't have the money to go through this who's feeding them you know not not just every Tom Dick and Harry they find on the road no I'm Sorry this is Dee\nBeing ... this is a well or IRS I'll say this is a well oiled find oil all\nMachine caravan of illegal immigrants has clearly been backed by somebody I don't know who it is and and and a lot of people been focused on it when he was behind this\nWho's given the resources I mean you can't just walk two thousand five hundred miles with no game plan right I mean clearly you feel like every night you're going to have food and water and shelter that's something that that that I think most people would agree is probably there\nNow that they're now they're actually reacting and you know that's a I mean that's what they're expecting and so I said I said earlier book I don't really care anymore\nOr who's funding it I just know that it shouldn't we shouldn't be manipulated in this way we we shouldn't be manipulated and allowed to be manipulate to being manipulated this way\nMhm but then we have to solve the internal problems because for a long time I have a precedent has requested funds for war and that could have been done already that way that he works you know as as a as a builder\nAnd ah unfortunately both parties disagree and we didn't get it through so right now he gets ... billion and a half he needs twenty five and now I heard that they were saying that if we win the November election\nThen ah they will fund the twenty five minutes police\nYeah no we are at work we should've we should have built the wall already\nIt should've been at least fifty percent done the ... the Republicans have dropped the ball on this did not fight hard enough for this as they should have ... that's ... and look I don't know if the Republicans will build this wall but I can tell you what happens if the Democrats win in the midterms I knew everything they do have a full blown open border\nPusher oh they don't please don't talk about the ah the cities where they house all the illegals or you know that they are ... I'm Sorry they have lost control of what a decency is of what the the last in this country are at which\nThey have to be respected that nearly understand that if they will do whatever it takes to remain in power and know that when the Democrats but some of the Republican and that we use that they don't care really about us you know the the the people that\nHave worked in this country are still working in this country and I've made this country great and capitalism is what made this country great\nThe the people that have worked in this country are still working in this country and I've made this country great and capitalism is what makes this country great\nThey they thought that they have socialism under control I come from the ... I came to this country when I was Fifteen Years old and I came to this country illegally when my country fail on your social is law and\nAnd you're there and you're the type of person I have no problem come in this country especially cause you to the legal way the right way and Mexico open borders to quote women and children from a migrant caravan\nThat in that news just breaking I'll tell you about coming out in a moment it's the ... for instance you know if you've not joined the conservative group a math\nThey're fighting for our values in the mid term elections I Want you to join now and I'm going to give you a free\nMembership conservative and you're listening me tonight and you're a member of a A R P you need to know what you're supporting AARP has decided to target conservative members of Congress that they think are vulnerable to defeat in the mid term elections and they're pumping big money into this midterm election to try to get the Democrats control the house\nDo my my grandparents came here from Italy and the early Nineteen hundreds late Eighteen hundreds there were no welfare there's no school lunch programs if you wanted nine children like they had you took care of your own you either come in here and have your own job\nThere was no medical coverage there was nothing you took care of you you took care of your family\nIt's not up to us and everybody else to take care of that as far as I'm concerned they're very legal evaded there may be fading invading us and it needs to be stopped\nHow what whatever means possible it needs to be stopped and the story and you don't like use water cannons on lethal force non lethal force water cannons rubber bullets tear gas white whatever I mean it it just has to be put an end\nTo which you can you can do to send a very humane way we get all the time in the law enforcement I mean you can protect the border and when you come in contact with people at the border you arrest them you can do it in a humane way I although I think the Democrats are hoping that there'll be you know it'll be chaos and the parents will be though and I can hear them now\nStripped from the children to the border and they're hoping to get this on camera all they I think all they want politically on to this\nIs to get a kid crying and screaming laws mothers being arrested at the border refusing to do with the law says and they'll turn that into TV ad and they'll try to flip the house and Senate would that I think this is nothing more than just about the midterms that's what this is\nIt is very convenient timing that's that's for sure\nAnd I I Would argue I Would argue it will not convenient I Would argue it's reality\nYeah it it is it's it's reality at this point in time where it's obviously plant buys them to have this coincides with the midterm elections\nAnd uh if uh I don't know what I'm Sorry I'm not sure what state you're in but uh if uh I'm I'm not for Andrew Gillum getting then as a as governor over here because I think would just be another type of Obama's setting\nAnd there's a lot of and there's a lot of voters and agree with you but I tell you what Democrats than any right now are very inspired they love in Florida for example the history the you know African American\nOr you know Democrat now you know a bomb a to point out though and you know we're upset and we hate Trump and we're going to kick him out of the state kind of thing [noise]\n[noise] yes I I see that and uh it's very heavy Democrats or which which I'm very surprised with the large Latin population down here especially coming out and the leading a a Castro's Cuba\nAnd they're very very good people and uh that that flood there and I'm surprised that it's that is very heavy Democrat or between date Broward and Palm Beach especially on the east coast like that\nYeah it's going to be if you guys have got a tough one down there in Florida thank you sir Howard you are on the bench Ferguson Sharon nice to have you with us go ahead\n[noise] then um so I've been shut down here for thirty five years in South Florida and I used to be I got a lot of students from calling every school got a lot of African Americans that got into the business it\nWas a nice mix a cultural diversity now it's like flooded flooded with low low low wages eight nine dollars an hour\nI'm for people and these folks you know let's say in it\nLow low wages eight nine dollars an hour I'm for people and\nFolks you know listen it's it's a tough thing to talk about with people but it's true it's it's really destroyed the restaurant business down here a lot of companies are just underpaying\nFolk so I get people that that my company hires that cannot speak in English at all and have no desire to really learn English um you can tell you know they just um there's high school the high school down the street they can go learn English\nWell like you know this is one of the number one stimulant of the U.S economy are Mexico's economy I should say is illegal immigrants sending money home\nYet\nSo so there's a lot of people that have no desire to do anything more than live here take our money and retire back in their home country and I can't blame them for that now I understand they want to I I understand that but but then what's on act like they're they're seeking asylum\nWhere it that's the difference that's it at that point I'm trying to make a lot of our brothers and sisters from Puerto Rico you agree or disagree with what\nHow Puerto Rico was run the government there but there's people that\nReally needed help that came over here and in Puerto Rico lot of people go to school and they teach in English and these folks are you know it's it's different and they're ... they need they seriously need help and um it's ... south Florida's just been bombarded\nIn my business it's destroyed the the the wages of Trump is healthy kind of help some but it's bad\n... and you know there's so many people say well we must have these image you know these people we must have then we must have them we must have them right you know we must weekly our economy would crash and we didn't have illegal immigrants\nThat oh my gosh route is just in the girls are already grape away jobs or unemployment rate right now is really low it would be even lower if we didn't have a legal immigrant workers and the wages would be higher\nYeah I I see these kids come out of calling every school and they're like chef really guys pay nine dollars an hour you gotta be kidding me\nI think you're right in my God I support myself well when you have other chefs from other parts of the world or other you know people that come in and are willing to undercut your wages this is what you have to pay\nThat's exactly right exactly I think spent they are and I was trying to\nGod Bless ya good to talk to a one eight hundred and four seven for nine seven three to Jerry you're on the bench Ferguson show high\nEither I just couldn't say that the we could just turned ... at the border I I think that's not going to work I think they are allowed to ask for asylum and then you have to go through this or putting putting them up in ... and waiting for the trial and all that stuff or you know\nI think you know I don't think you get ... I think you turn them away I think you get 'em out of here immediately\nSaying you can't do that ... there's nobody asked for asylum and helps to be allowed to come in and and go on with the trial it's while they have all these are these people waiting waiting with you know the separation problems and all that stuff\nWell ... years ago say when the president said we're going to secure the border by stopping them at the border we use in the military then do it that way don't let them come across\nBut I think that's illegal I mean with the ACLU is going to sue the early to him\nWell the ACLU will see you over being breathing so I'm not too worried about them\nYou know what I mean I wouldn't judge said can't shoot him I don't know what the army is going to be able to do really is a big in turmoil but it's actually illegal you'll look it up on Google I did it when\nI I went to live the bare minimum ... there's some gray area there but the bare minimum\nTurmoil but it's actually illegal you look it up on Google or did it when\nI was just the bare minimum and the ... there's some gray area there but the bare minimum what I Would say is this\nI I Would I Would immediately\nStart the deportation process on them\nAnd I would make it clear that you're not going to get ahead of the other people that are out there right well let me get an added a bare minimum of their minimum you are not going to get a ... a head of those other people you're not going to\nI think the only thing is going to workers were threatened the Mets and government we're going to we're going to make it hurt if you don't keep these ...\nAnd ... and ... and ... and we and we heard that I mean we we saw that with people that were saying just that saying you know ... and this president has made it clear to Mexico were not screwing around with us\nAnd we need to make it hurt because they're the ones that cause the problem they're letting them come all across the country each other rather than them and send them back before the dinner I mean that's the only who's going to work and lived upstairs to nominate clout to make it hurt Mexico that's what we need to do\nWell ... it would wouldn't it be nice I mean seriously wouldn't it be nice\nTo have some have somebody down below was hoping you head north of ... well I\nLook I think he's got more than any other president we've seen in modern times and say you're in the military down there and that you're going to enforce the law and you're going to protect the border I give them a lot of credit for that I get a whole lot of credit for that\nHey if you got a cell phone and your cell phone is a big mobile you need to know about patriot mobile not always going to save your money on your cell phone bill but you'll be supporting conservative causes every time you use your phone here's how it works you got a cell phone\nAnd if you do you pay the bill every month and you may have no idea where your money's going did you know if you're with big mobile you are actually supporting Democrats taking over the house and the Senate and the mid term elections\nDid you know combined Eighteenth Denver rise and they've already spent almost two hundred million dollars supporting more than ten thousand Democrats to get elected and reelected at the local state and national level if you don't want your money going to liberal candidates and you don't want your money going to liberal organizations like Planned Parenthood\nYou need to switch to patriot mobile patriot was the only conservative cell phone company in the U.

after his visa expired but now with the caravan ice hoping to get back across the U.S border as an opportunity\nIs another guy when I heard about the caravan I knew it was my chance he called his cousin an uncle who still live in California to let them know that he was on his way and he's coming\n\nAgain are sorted out about two hundred people form new about four thousand when in Mexico now there are about Seventy two Seventy four hundred people roughly\nThe president says sadly it looks like Mexico's police military\nPeople roughly and the president says sadly it looks like Mexico's police military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border the United states [noise] um and there you go and he's now saying he's in cutting off aid to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador\nI'm\nAll right we're really really real quickly\nA Geraldo Rivera wrote a piece on this and I want to share what he said because this is the attitude that liberals take on this whole thing he says the caravan of migrants doggedly heading our way from Guatemala and Honduras or a description doggedly ...\nHeading away you know there that we have to feel some sympathy for them and it's causing great consternation and angry condemnation in Washington DC\nAnd he goes on to write this was Geraldo now it'd be easy to support the deployment of US military and other draconian solutions to the migrant crisis generally and the caravan specifically if the marchers were gang bangers or ISIS recruiters\nHe goes on to write even the most hardened anti immigrant pundit cannot justify actions taken to stop the care of him by saying it is mostly about national security is not that is absolutely wrong\nIt is about national security allow people to just come in instead of abiding by the laws of this country how to get in and I I I'll tell you you'll have people for walking air from every corner of a world illegally\nWe have structures set in place to get people in on a legal basis and maybe maybe that structure is flawed and maybe we have to look at it and we have to fix some of those problems that's a possibility but one thing is for sure there are laws in place to admit people to this country\nAnd the idea\nOpening our borders and saying should come out in no country does that Mexico did not even do that when they were clamoring and banging away at at the at the gates\nAs a matter of fact the federal rallies down there on the border between Mexico in Guatemala literally said to those people in the caravan uh hey stop the aggression that's what they said what you're doing is aggressive behavior and the people of course came through anyway\nAnd then they're being they're going ... through Mexico trying to get through our border ferret feeling that they they may actually get in\nThey may actually breakthrough and somehow be part of a big part of our structure here ... goes on to say\nIt's his opinion\nFear of our nation being overrun by poor hungry brown people and sufficient numbers to change our basic national character\nIs motivates most critics of this caravan and more broadly illegal immigration no no no don't be stupid Geraldo there'll be stupid\nIllegal immigration is breaking the law it's illegal\nWhat do you not understand about the word illegal these people are illegal don't tell me human beings can be illegal their status is that of illegal there aliens ... they're not from this country so therefore they are illegal aliens\nAnd I am a hardened anti illegal immigrant pundit don't just say anti immigrant 'cause you're lumping every one into one is saying that if any anyone who opposes illegal immigration is in fact anti immigrant\nWell into one is saying that if any anyone who opposes illegal immigration is in fact anti immigrant\nI never said and I know I'm I haven't talked to any folks who share my philosophy who say that they are anti immigrant we should not admit people at all we never said that\nMy grandparents came from or other places in the ... they give her around the other side of the globe\nLot of people have people who came grandparents parents grandparents great grandparents and more from other parts of the globe nobody is that I met his anti immigrant we are and should be\nAnti illegal immigrant and the fact of around those try to lump everybody into one little bigoted little concept is revolting\nFear and actually being overrun by poor hungry brown people have sufficient numbers you play the race card Geraldo you do that any way I see you do that all the time there's nothing to do with a ... whether they're poor with they're hungry with her brown black yellow of white doesn't matter\nIf they were all white Europeans and they were coming across in a in a caravan I wouldn't want them admitted\n\nIllegally I don't care who they are where they're from what the color is what they're uh finances are what their religion is I don't care what it is if you're here coming here illegally you should not be admitted to this country not at all\nHe says most Americans are responding very negatively to the caravan and even see it as an existential threat to the nation it is because it's sending a message out if they get in all you have to do is come up as a mob\nThat's what it is a mob and and you could intimidate the people at the border and you can get through because they're a big enough mob started out with two hundred dollars Seventy two to Seventy four hundred it's a mob\n\nAnd he talks about the fact by the way the president said to my Geraldo now that the president use our military to stop the caravan from crossing over the southern border ... and he talks about the policy kind of taught us which prevents military from enforcing civilian laws\nThis would not be enforcing civilian laws this would be around that doesn't want to hear this would this would be preventing an invasion of this country\nYou don't have you don't have to have guns and bombs and tanks to be part of an invasion\nThese people think they're doing like going from two hundred over Seventy seven thousand as a mob they feel they can intimidate the people at the border intimidate the United states make us look bad the eyes and so therefore they can break into this country\nThey can invade this country our military is set up to prevent an invasion of the nation reviews the military to prevent invasions in the past during World War two and we can certainly prevent them from coming into this country now as an invasion\nTaylor moral he has to say and what the answers are in just a

I don't know I but listen to me how you handle it you have seven thousand by the time it gets you will be a thousand or more people and\nThey want to come in what do you do\nThat and we\nWhat do you do when they get to the border and what do you do I'm asking you\nOn that make you want to feed him humanely that's one thing I Would sure\nYou're not you're not answering I Want to know what you do how would you welcome I thought OK okay let me just say let me just say something\nToday something ... you know ... your your your your mistaking them once you've issue here and and we've got callers tell us about how they came to this country legally there are people right now trying to get into this country and they've been trying for the last year or Eighteen months or so to try and do it legally and if we admit illegal aliens\nAnd we keep the elite people who are trying to do it legally out\nWhile we admit the illegal aliens that then then then that we're we're doing is giving the middle finger to the people are trying to do it legally solution\nPeople break laws every line in this country people break them\nBecause they by by by but that doesn't mean you can do that you don't do that you do to do that\nAgain I mean you know 'cause nobody gets no\nNo no no ... or under Trump Trump he's preventing these preventing people from coming in hopefully I'm Kevin ... hopefully he will prevent these people from coming across why don't you don't get out of that I Know I in the navy I appreciate your call this afternoon I wanted to find out\nHopefully he will prevent these people from coming across why don't you don't get out of\nWind though I Know you ... your calls after that I wanted to find out from she had to say John I'm so sorry got cut off and I appreciate your calling back already had sir\n[noise] ah yeah thank you so I was just frustrated with from a tweet this morning we're over there and that\nThat there's these Middle Eastern that are with the care of and I mean come on that for the Scots the audit these plans for the worst common denominator and that's why you have a lot of education like myself there so turned off by this guy he's such any it's so obvious what he's doing or getting close to the mid term what they're going to do let's pull out the whole anti immigration\nWere way way way we do know first of all we don't know what this thing is is is gone from two hundred to four thousand and then they came across the Mexican border from Guatemala and now it's up to seven thousand plus now we don't know whether or not there are people who are bad actors in that in those seven thousand plus\nAnd and he's suggesting maybe they are maybe maybe he's right maybe there are bad actors in their let me ask you something though how would you and I mean and I'm ... I'm supporting the president is how you handle the situation\nI mean you get a man you process them and then you are the ones that aren't at first I don't I mean I don't have a problem with the intent on the border I Do have a problem with the race baiting and the Trump supporters of line legal\nBut if we admit him if once we bring them on our land than we are legally bound to give them some kind of little chips so then they are supposed to show up in court\nAnd they never do and that's why we have anywhere from twelve to twenty million illegals here right now uh you know I mean I I that's why I'm just saying do you where I'm coming from\nWe cannot allow them to be able to step foot into this country there are people who want to come in legally legally and and to allow one illegally and and the give credence to that illegal alien\nIs saying to the other leagues people trying to legally you go to hell\nAnd that's what we're telling them and I don't want to do that because we are supposed to be a nation of laws\nWell you're my whole point is like and I agree with you on a lot of that stuff but I it's the message and the message is what Trump gets in trouble\nIf you're if you're telling me that the president is bombastic if you tell me the presence bombastic I'm going to tell you that I've been saying that for a long time yes he is he is bombastic and he says a lot of outrageous things I'm not going to I'm not going to fight you on that one my friend you have to say\nThat the problem is that your your college never ... never point that out that you know what this guy is playing into our racial fears we can't let ...\nFirst of all I've been saying that when he when he ran for the presidency or even though I was supporting him I said at the time he was bombastic and I when people said to be do you defend his tweets and ... and my answer always there's no I'm not defending him I don't I don't my first one I don't tweet almost at all\nI don't use Twitter almost at all okay and so I don't I'm not and if he wants to that's up to him I'm not going to defend it or condemn I I'm I'm stay away from his tweets\nI look at his actions what he has done for this country in terms of uh the taxes the ... or ... unemployment I Know Obama was in Vegas today taking credit for the low unemployment and the er how people are doing financially and ah he he he called a ... this president they\nTen ... dictator basically I mean you know I understand but I'm looking at it to see what the Trump is accomplished\nI liked what he's accomplished I don't defend his tweets I don't defend is bombastic or things that he says but I Do like what he does\nAnd for that alone I Would have voted for him and I would vote for him again John and John I appreciate your calling wanna thanks so much for joining us this afternoon here I ...\nYou know I mean I was frustrated about\nOne thing sorts of joining us this afternoon here I catch on the\nYou know I mean I was frustrated about\nWhat I was so frustrated about is that um is that any ... was wanting to condemn the president for this condemned the president for that but when I said what would you do how you handle it the only thing she could say it's let them in\nAnd you cannot allow illegals to ... people break the law all the ... yes they do it when people are caught breaking the law shouldn't they be prosecuted\nAnd ... and if convicted should and they pay the price why would you allow an illegal to come into this country why would you allow an illegal to come in and then let them stay here after they've broken the law\nSeven ... seven three three five nights excite really get to all your calls in a moment and if you're calling just hold on we're going to ask the calls in just one moment seven

I I what you're saying I I don't think it's the wrong way to go about it at all\nUm by the way we're sending five hundred million dollars a year to Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador and that's where the president wants to stop immediately and I think he's a hundred percent correct why should we be giving them money when they're pushing their people into our country illegally and they're not cooperating with us why should we give them anything\nThey have fewer people there now so they obviously don't need that much money anyway\nThat's absolutely correct uh feel I appreciate your call my friends want to thank you so much for joining us this afternoon seven three three can't send two seven three three five nine six eight\nReal quickly or in a piece of you said about this Mike you're on tanks anti\nMike Mike snow there Mike gunman a David David you're on camera Cindy welcome to the show\nHey on a love you love the show on every now and then you got me all fired\nUp a couple of those uh first of all I'm independent I'm not a Republican I'm not a liberal [noise] um\nThis whole immigration thing is is is a I'm a big Trump guy okay and I was I'm actually a registered Democrat believe it or not\nUm but I'm a big Trump guy and the reason is the legal immigration is a reason why I voted for President Trump because during the downturn you know I work construction and and uh and I'm In the construction service industry let's just call me and her conditioning guy OK okay during the recession there were so few jobs\nAnd all the little construction jobs that I go and try to acquire and talked to contractors they all told me in this in this town and man I can only hire illegals\nAnd I I I I was I worked for almost two years luckily during the boom I saved a whole bunch of money and I was able to survive but that is the reason that many of us elected Trump or ... or ... us guys at you know\nDidn't go to college were trade guys are we work with our hands we like we do these jobs\nDo they actually said to you they were ... they were hiring illegals\nOh absolutely yeah and we you know these guys are ... or so you know we gotta we gotta hire you know oh well there are legal but law that doesn't matter\nYou know what I mean to say one thing to a real quickly and and I think this is really a very very important um you're you're a Democrat and I I'm\nNot I'm not I'm not no independent I'm ... I'm a registered Democrat on accident\nNo it's okay it's kind of a one time\nNo I'm not I'm not I'm not a independent I'm a I'm a registered Democrat on ... [laughter]\nBut no it's okay it's kind of you as a one time I mean the Democrats are we're a very\nA logical party there are people who I I mean really I think of Henry scoop Jackson from from uh from Washington years' ago um I I think people like John F. Kennedy I mean these people were saying I Would be considered I mean Republicans like yes but the Democratic party has gone so far to the left\nOr you know what it was as I was growing up it's really too bad I Would hope that people\nAnd again you mistakenly register by all the people who were really true Democrats in the true sense of the word a retake their party again and don't allow the the the Cory bookers and and the Maxine Waters and have a life at\nAll or Harris is the Kamala Harris says because they have now taken this ... this party over and at five thirty today I must say exactly what Cory bookers see he wants to run for president and when you hear what he has to say it's going to blow your mind or the Cory Booker and what what's going on here and that's coming up at five thirty\nI appreciate how am I ... I could just make one more point they've asked make almost or an hour\nFor almost a second generation or second generation here my mom was born here\nUm my grandparents came for Puerto Rico my grandfather fought in World War one because he was so ... for the United states it bailout it at the time as a Puerto Rican citizen after the Spanish American war he went on why it was so proud of the United states should stay out of there\nAnd and and and you know and I saw a show it to all these western ... set of all the all clear that anybody to Mexico which all our money didn't set for next quarter third largest start up\nConsumption of life the way they get money if we stop that\nAnd we and we use e verify year and our first time incident you lose your business like if you hire an illegal immigrants undocumented worker I don't care what it is what's your business wise\nSecond time Clinton years in jail automatically when there's no point when there is no employers that will hire illegal immigrants they all come here at that if\nI by the way I'm a huge supporter of e verify and to mandate it to make sure every every business has to use it and uh and it's got to be solid and the people have got to use it and uh yes and I would\nWalk into the I was ... and I would walk into\nThe big big big time if they knowingly hired illegals there was a mistake that's one thing or bad information or not but if they knowingly hire illegal I Would sock it to them big big big time David I appreciate your call my friend called back anytime seven three three cats anti seven three
