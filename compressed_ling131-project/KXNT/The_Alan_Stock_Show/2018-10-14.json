I ... I kind of discovered craft beer I mean the first year I had was read about Nineteen Ninety eight right when I was Twenty one issue I'm In Colorado and that I mean back then it was\nThey were really only two breweries that were really pushing it um and it was here in Nevada and a new Belgium it was just so early I remember having like fat tire and being like wow this is ridiculously good you know this is so complex and now\nYou know obviously things have changed but um\nUp in and help each other it's very cooperative so when I came up to Vegas I'm I noticed that um there was a lot of it you know there there was a lot of things going on but there ... there weren't that many local events\nAnd so I saw you know crap ears opportunity it hadn't really gain steam yet you know it wasn't anywhere near you know we're California or or Phoenix was or anything like that so\nWe started kind of combining um local culture and events with craft beer and that kind of took off from there\nSo obviously in the last decade or so maybe maybe even longer than that there's been this big uprising of of beer what'd you attribute that to basically\nYeah it's it's interesting um a lot of what we saw and what we've seen is influences from neighboring states I think um I've always said that and in I Believe it and it's still happening today\nThat local beer influences the market so some of the biggest craft beer cities that you see 'em they're the ones you know it's like Portland and San Diego and you know I mean these are places with you know San Diego's guy I think a hundred and Seventy five breeze just in the county alone right now and it's it keeps going up\nAnd people are like my how do you have that many breweries there well I mean it's it's become part of the culture it's not just pure culture it's like real culture so um that's really kind of I think pushed our way\n[noise] um and would that we've had a lot more local breweries pop up to on this side um you know when I started we started motley back in two thousand eleven\nYou know there were five local breweries up the you know at the event and I think there's like thirty five forty just in Nevada alone now so I'm I think that that's what happens is that the local you know people\nYou know are very you know find a really cool to be able to drink beer in your own backyard you know by by people that just made it right there in the state you know straight from the source fresh so\nThe local scene really helps on that side of the local breweries\nYeah there's been such an explosion recently a brewery just if James Lovell lady in a creek um some of the in in the in the game longer than others and there just seems to be more and more and more\nEvery single month I I Wonder how big you know the beer industry in Las Vegas will get and why is Las Vegas I mean obviously we've been challenged kind of what their wine industry but then being able to to grow inside has been you know all the technology that was essentially brought in\nFor the cannabis industry can also be used for the wind industry keys I'm looking to see how that dynamic plays out but why is beer booming in Vegas specifically\nYeah I I think it's just that you know it's the idea that um you know people are able to discover ... at the local scene is really kind of blown up out here to things and you know you guys don't remember too I mean a decade ago when I got here\nIt's nothing like it is now we have sports teams and we've got you know off strip shaft shift moving from the strip off strip\nUm it's the same thing happening with beer you know I think that there's just you know people are starting to discover you know that while Las Vegas has this local side of things that I haven't seen before and and I think one of the big things too is like the casinos have adopted at too they're like oh you know we're into the craft beer side\nWe see the upside to it um you know and so that's helped as well but\nI Do still think that you know from a from a city standpoint you know just as a as a local culture um craft beer is you know it's it's every point that these local breweries are pouring and trying to make original and knew\nUm you know trying to give Las Vegas in identifiable you know style you know I think that's been been one of the things that a lot of ... really working hundreds of James does it was such a rye\nUm I mean there's there's lots of ... there's lots of different folks doing craft house doing it with resin\nA lot of different beers kind of coming out now that are giving identity so I think that helps a lot\nSo I I feel like downtown Vegas is kind of leave it from a city standpoint at least downtown is kind of the ground zero for beer connoisseurs is there a reason why that's the case as opposed to kind of like summer learn early on that island or something like that\n[noise] downtown just the hub of like everything that's just you know exploded culturally for us I think that was to me it just identified that as the first start of um you know really really starting to localized Las Vegas there is this interest that\nYou know with a downtown project coming together and started to influence that people you know finding that ability to express themselves identify it helped to that we had a lot of breeze open up down there I'm an argument could be made a bunch of different ways for like that ground zero point but I think from the standpoint of\nYou know just recognition and people starting to get into it and it be becoming part of that\nYou know the hip culture that it's definitely went downtown is all about [noise]\nWe've had breweries you know doing beer you know and doing it well for a long time out here I mean big dogs burning company if you guys have heard of him\nYou know I'm ... right yeah upon a bunch of ... um you know started with Dave auto a great guy great brewer and now they pass qualities arguably like one of the best brewers um the Belgian style and the entire nation these amazing he's won a million words\nBut I mean getting back to the whole downtown idea yeah I mean downtown the epicenter for everything you know I mean you've got major festivals out there we've we've moved our festival down there\nUm and it's just kind of that's central melting pot where I think craft beer fits in well it's new it's cool it's had\nIt's flavorful with complex and I think it um I think downtown is embraced it really well\nYou've mentioned a couple of other cities which I Want to touch and so you've lived in Colorado yeah you lived in Phoenix yeah and he's also lived in uh San Diego San Diego's all little later in the middle of Colorado's not a city of\nDenver, Colorado Colorado Springs is so I just want to say I feel like Brian everywhere you go it seems that there's a booming beer I Want to say that maybe Las Vegas this knack ... our\nOur is already in play among those cities which is awesome now I Know for are you still do in festivals also in San Diego as well\nYeah we we don't do anything in San Diego anymore we had a festival there twice uh we did it back to back years it was called a ruined food festival it was awesome\nSan Diego is one of those cities though that is just you know it's a beer festival like for weekends\nSo for us you know our focus you know we we definitely enjoy doing that out there it's still something I Would look at doing but ... a lot of the beer festival starting to blend together because they're so it's already established right and so there's the culture there and the beer is really establish here\nWe used to love new people you know coming to the table everyday being like a you know I really haven't had a lot of craft beer I'm not into it yet and so our goal is still the festivals too you know hopefully help out the you know the ... and get them something that they like and something new being pushed by the local breweries\nUm but also getting people who are like I really like beer you know but um you know and trying to get them going\nWith Brian shape and by the way from alt labor is if you have not you're if you're just joining in so I have a question for you I Am a a red wine junkie and I'm not really that into beer or give me a beer for the red wine connoisseur\nI always tell people that are in the wind because I I like red wine to and you know the ... and the cabs I always had people start with Belgians\nFavorites the line is always so long ago and in fact\nI learned last week they're moving to a larger location a few doors down the line I guess\nThe Las Vegas boulevard location looks like it's moving to a location right next to the pepper mouth\nAnd it needs to it's always packed they're not it's not exactly hidden so not not doesn't qualify for hidden\nJot it not a hidden gem there but let's talk us check it out\nMurderer chores give me one I'm a big fan of Marcia Baucus up in several oh which I had a lot of people if you've ever been there it's really incredible foods amazing the setting is second to none in Las Vegas I mean you really don't feel like you're in Vegas at all you know the majority of the restaurants sits on the water on a manmade lake\nJust sitting out there and the turtles kind of walking around a little bit you know it has a a wine shop as soon as you walk in so you pick your bottle of wine strip from the shop to Roger Roger table open it up right on the spot it's really a fun fun experience and something that you just don't get in the city\nSo you know what's really funny is you brought that up and then I remembered a owners in March ... Jeff in Rhonda why it who we both known for years for them they're actually debuting a remodel a cocktail bar and spirits program so that's coming online ah here in October so we've been invited to go

Mr President it's a matter of fact that's how the book opens ladies and gentlemen without very phrase major fantastic you want to know why go by the book\nJoni Ernst Republican from Iowa senator is with us we were talking about the Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process slash saga slash clash has it changed hasn't hurt the institutions said I Want to play for you served with your indulgence what the president said at the swearing in ceremony\nJudge Kavanaugh would already been officially sworn in it but this was a ceremony at the White House play that for him because you know someone\nOn behalf of our nation I Want you apologize to Brett and the entire job with a family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nGoes you step forward to serve our country deserves a fair and dignified evaluation not eight year period of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nWhat happened to the capital of family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process\nYou agree with that said well I Do agree and I I think it's twofold as well I think not only a apologizing to judge Kavanaugh for the way his family was treated the way he was treated\nBut I Would say two fold at the way Dr Ford was treated as well um so I Do think that judge Kavanaugh was eminently qualified I did support him in my vote\nI also do believe that Dr Ford did experience some sort of trauma and her lifetime um I don't believe that was Brett Kavanaugh that perpetrated a that that intimate crime against or that I think she was outed um she wished to remain anonymous\nAnd unfortunately she was outed and she face those same threats against her who do you blame for that housing I work I Do blame the Democratic committee staff\nAnd what do you think their motivation was to help her or dissing cover\nI think it was the St Cavanaugh I think they put her feelings of an animal ... aside and they threw or to the wolves and I think by doing that I think they hope to think that Kavanaugh's nomination\nBut did you strike you as a reluctant with witness once she did testify under oath and public\nNo she did not seem to be reluctant at that point she had already been outed and I think it was at that point then she was able to make her statement I'm and she did and I think every accuser has the right to be heard I've I've been adamant about that for years I did work with sexual assault a survivors back\nIn college so this has been a long standing issue for\nSo let's take a pause give my audience a bit of your ... important to you and it's important this conversation\nYeah absolutely so going back to my days at Iowa State university um it was just a a personal decision\nIn a women's crisis shelter and I worked\nThe crisis hotline as well as carried a beep or as a responder for those women that had been either physically abused and domestic situations or those that had been\nA intimately violent violently sexually abused so I Would do calls to women at the jail um sometimes they would\nRetaliate against their abusers um I get calls at the hospital if they were doing rape kits\nUm I get calls on the crisis flying I Would respond to go with women to pick up groceries or you know mundane things and things even so it it's a very important topic to me to make sure that uh women and children are protected and sometimes those survivors were men as well\nSo we go to experience what was your own emotional reaction and what did you see or did not see a doctor forge testimony that reminded you of what you actually experiencing those ...\nWell I think that um it it did remind me of the fact that I felt that she actually had been abused at some point I felt that\nAnd so I have no doubt that she has been abused at some point but what there was was a lack of corroboration from the witnesses that she identified and so when they came forward and in their statements basically said you know what this didn't happen or there was no such party\nUm it it hurt her credibility\nAnd when she was asked by leader was Senator Durbin for certain or you should one hundred percent how did you take\nThat well\nA lot of things can change through a number of years and sometimes you can displaced people you may not remember what their face looks like you may not remember physical characteristics that there might be something that triggers them replaces that face with somebody else's face\nUm and that's why it's so difficult so many years after an incident to actually be certain about what happened and this is my statement to anyone that is a survivor\nSexual abuse is that if you are comfortable coming forward right away you need to do it right away\nAnd for those and look at this process and say\nAt the highest levels\nOf victim is still not believe what would you say to that person who wonders if if that belief factor can exist and will exist for them if need be\n... I think it is very difficult and I don't know where that answer is because he certainly don't want to wrongly um wrongly convict someone who is innocent [noise]\nUm but you also want to make sure that that accuser is heard and has the opportunity to step forward if they so choose again many survivors will not want to share their story because it is such an intimate crime\nIt's such an intimate experience um so I I Do think it's difficult I don't know what the right answer is that I simply know that you can't just accused someone and have them convicted\nOn the spot with an allegation or an accusation\nGod brings us to the intersection of all these questions\nIn politics seems like in our political environment voted this is possibly the we used the least flexible or the least capable institution frightened how to deal with these issues very much so because everything there is all over the years and it does and the belief system begins to form\nAlmost instantly along partisan waves and when there are things are either ambiguous or remember it in a certain way or there there's a lack of or cooperation it all sort of falls on these tribal was the political was organized appeals to me like you're you're in you're in you're in it or not\nRight and I think you saw the shift um after the supplemental information came forward and all senators were able to view that\nYou did see a shift of messaging that went away from sexual assault and more focused on\nWell he doesn't have the right temperament or the right character what is your mood for and I concluded that the Democratic colleagues saw as well that there was no uh implication of wrongdoing or sexual assault and so what they did was focus on the fact that he was very short with a number of senators during the committee hearing\nAnd how did you process that well what do you expect him to be if you're accused him of X Y and Z while\nRight a ... and that's the way your words I don't want to but that's the way I felt I tend to try and be very calm even when people are her ringing me but I haven't been in a situation where my family members have been threatened I'm\nCertainly all of US Senators we've had threats at one point or another but when they start going after family members um when you have people screaming at you Knight and day I I can imagine nerves get frayed\nAnd you think that's what happens they think was struck with judge Kavanaugh that isn't that go around with some of the Democratic side I Do think and again with her even veteran that schools I think he could of course\nAnd even to the White House he wishes he had yes I think he could have been what would you simply holding blame as\nWell I don't hold ... well in that circumstance I\nI think he was under an awful lot of pressure and I can't claim to know what he was feeling at that time I just know how horrible it would be it should I be accused of something I didn't do um especially something like that with so much riding on it as a nominee to the Supreme Court of the United states\nAll of all of it so let me ask you this because I think it's important question\nPresident has made it clear he's open to another summit with Kim Jong or\nIt could happen sooner rather later of course the president's words this very week should there be another son that if there isn't something that is tangible and announced or inspectors or you know there's something to measure right yes or no yes\nThere are some exerted have another some there should be another little does not ... but no\nThere needs to be there needs to be a summit that there needs to be a\nProduct that comes from the summit ... says yes inspectors are going to come in and we're going to open our country and the United states or other inspectors can come in and take a look\nAnd you're familiar with this I'm sure that that stuff has to be worked out before there was a sub\nWell certainly it should be but has finally Raman assigned to agreement needs to come out of that summit\nAnd if it is it so if the next natural question is if that doesn't happen then there shouldn't be a third of it I mean there were there were loggerheads we have to stop this idea that talking is getting a somewhere because it's obviously not so you would you open to one more summit and then we look there's got to be\nAble to keep pressure on North Korea and we continue with sanctions we continue to tightened down on China um whatever we can do to make it very painful for them\nSo there's also brings us a kind of an interesting segue to the topic of Russia\nAnd China both are accused but Russia particularly or possibly of helping the north Koreans have eight sections of the United nations headquarters shipped to ship transfer scored its will get into the ... I Know you're I Know you can talk about so I'm not going to do your thunder talk to us about your level of concern anxiety about that and if this was very she was doing enough to speak out against\nWell when it when it comes to China and Russia and the fact that they can import good uh whether it's food products whether it's petroleum products what have you energy sources they are doing now we know that they are doing now we need ...\nIn violation of sanctions and we need to figure out how to intercept that some and my own as well to ship to ship transferred well why or why sports discover yes because you can sanction a nation um but if you were moving goods from one nation shipped to another nation shout out ads they see\nThen you don't know if it's in violation of sanctions and so you actually need to catch those ships and in ah the action and the ocean as a very\nLarge play I've heard about that very very big so this\nBrings us to another word that sometimes is talked about in this context but it's a very touchy were\nIt's a touchy\nWere it is a very touchy received\nInternationally under international law as an act of war ... you would need a significant by Congress it's a dramatic extra escalation mhm is it something that should at least in theory be considered or be on the table every part of these back room conversation\nIt is something that can be considered and discussed that we absolutely have to have buy in from our allies as well this is not something that I think the United states should engage on its own\nIs that even possible I think it is possible but\nTo round up this conversation\nPeriod of time you're comfortable with and I imagine you're sent a Republican colleagues are comfortable with to see how this works right what does that period of time six months a year to year it\nCould be six months a year but we need to know how quickly they are developing weapons um\nAnd I think we probably have intelligence on that and so from that we should be able to gauge trying\nOne thing Korea analysts have told us on the spread program is one of the reasons there's less testing is because the north Koreans were satisfied with what they have that's all right well you get to that ... when I think that's true\nI think the north Koreans will sit there on time frame and I'll do what they want to do I'm Kim Jong un hasn't felt the a full implication of sanctions because of the smuggling that occurs on the ship to ship transfers that occurred and we've got to figure out and tightened down on those countries that are assisting

conditioning systems running like a puff and now here's your host\nLas Vegas gene here with climate control experts thank you so much for tuning in today to learn everything there is to know about your heating and air conditioning system\nWe're gonna talk about what to look for in a heating and cooling contractor and then we're going to uncover the keys to making that sucker run for ever\nHave you have somebody come out and tell you that you needed to replace your furnace or air conditioning system\nI interviewed a guy one time who said that the company that he worked for required him to try to sell new heating and cooling equipment to customers whose heating and air conditioning systems or two and three and four years old\nOh look I don't care how in efficient they claim your heating and air conditioning system is if it's less than eight years old you shouldn't even be having the conversation\nHow about your energy bills do you have energy bills to just keep going up and up and up did you replace your air conditioning system maybe or your furnace and not see the energy savings that you were promised\nI Want to talk to those of you out there who have a furnace or air conditioner or he bumped that six or eight years old and you've been told to junk it in my lifetime I can count on one hand how many six year old systems that I've seen\nThat needed to be replaced most of the time they just needed a really good cleaning\nIt's going to take you years to get your money back out of a new air conditioning system do you have six or eight grand just lying around that you want to Chuck it your heating and cooling system or would you rather spend just a little bit of money getting it cleaned up operating more efficiently\nYour energy bills viewer breakdowns and more money in your pocket\nNow we're gonna talk a little bit about what you should expect from the heating and air conditioning company that's coming out to maintain your system because I've got a feeling that a lot of you out there have been getting the drive by maintenance\nYou'll recognize it it's the one where they come out for twenty to forty five minutes ask you for fifty sixty Seventy bucks and then they're gone\nMaybe they hook up a set of refrigerant gauges maybe not\nIf somebody's not spending at least Seventy five to Ninety minutes you need to get somebody else\nA climate control experts to not usually takes between Seventy five two hundred and twenty minutes from start to finish now we call that cleaning or tuna a total system rejuvenation\nAnd it includes cleaning your outdoor coils and inspection and documentation of about sixty to Seventy different components in your furnace and air conditioner\nSome of your going sixty Seventy different components that's a lot of stuff right\nWell when our guys show up they spend an average is Seventy five to a hundred and twenty minutes working to get your heating and air conditioning system as close to factory fresh condition as possible not to mention their criminal background checked and drug screen to\nDid you know that the number one and number two trades being taught in the prisons today we're plumbing and air conditioning\n[noise] that's right folks the number one and number two trains being taught in the presence today are plumbing an air conditioning\nNot listen folks I'm not saying that I don't believe that people deserve a second chance I really do believe that if you made a mistake and you did time for it when you get out you should be able to get a job\nI just decided I wasn't going to put them in your home now fellas if your wife's going to be the one that's home when the heating and air conditioning guy comes by do you want to take a chance that that person is someone who learned heating and cooling in the ...\nDo you have kids how 'bout them did you know the fifty percent of the guys that I have interviewed can't pass in nationwide criminal background check\nFolks I went through over one hundred resumes and a period of three weeks and only hired one person climate control experts\nThey're very selective about who they put in your home\nI Want to talk about one of the gentlemen I interviewed and keep in mind when I Do an interview I asked them all kinds of questions about how they do the work\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean a blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI lean in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis year that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't\nNeed now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and the reality is that\nWorked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got a filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to

reserved one of these just for you but you got to be the first person okay that clean my heater dot com\nHey let's take some time to talk about something that way too many people overlook okay and that's what's in the air in our homes\nYou hear a lot of talk about air pollution and air quality and the environment right but did you know that the environmental protection agency the EPA says that the air in our homes is often more polluted than the air of the largest\nCities in the United states and with all the time and energy that we spent trying to clean up the environment to ensure that were breathing clean air people\nOften ignore their own homes the air and your own home is where we get exposed to things like molds and bacteria and allergens and chemicals\nSo how does the air in our homes get polluted well some of the chemicals\nAre from things like cleaning products underneath your sink plastics look at all the stuff in your house that's made a plastic\nAll of that stuff actually off gases or releases chemicals into your air for years\nTaints everybody's got paint on the wall right that stuff off gases that's our they've got the OC free paints nowadays there's glues there's pressed woods there's furniture all that stuff made with chemicals in it than there\nAre the molds and allergens that come into our homes from outside through doors and windows and\nUnsealed air ducts and when you go outside mold attaches itself to your clothing\nEven your pets cherry mold spores into the house with them okay and the worst part is that it can and almost always does grow in our homes\nAnd most people don't realize that your air conditioner doesn't bring new air into your house but then it just constantly recycles the same old air that's already in your home\nThat means that if there are chemicals and molds and pollutants in the air they're going to just keep re circulating unless you have something in place to remove them\nThey are just magically going to disappear or right\nAnd the air in your home can circulate over a hundred times per day through your air conditioning system which means that all of the pollutants just keep circulating for you and your family to keep breathing in\nThis can lead to a major major health problems over time I said it before and I'll say it again if you don't have a good filter for your air or your air conditioner\nYou become the filter\nThink about that you either filter the air with your lungs or you get a good filter you choose\nSo let's focus on the molds and the allergens that are found in the air okay 'cause the fact of the matter is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air conditioner\nLast time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens and you can have side effects from them right seven of them are toxic okay so what are the side effects and breathing mold\nObviously everyone's different but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects that we're able to find we're talking about things like upset stomachs weight gain fatigue\nLoss of sleep night sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell auto immune disorders or sexual side effects and let's not forget about depression\nPeople often experience allergy like symptoms not realizing that the air that they're breathing in their homes is the main problem so what\nAre people doing to remove these molds and allergens from the air that circulating over and over and over again in their home\nWhile there are a few different methods but the one most common method and the most effective is using ultra violet light okay\nSo let's talk about these ultraviolet lights have you guys heard about these things well the first guy to have a breakthrough using ultraviolet light was Neal spin sitting back in Nineteen\nAnd Neal's won the Nobel Prize for his work using ultraviolet lights to treat tuberculosis\nAnd because of Neal Simpsons work ultraviolet light has since become the gold standard and it's used in many different ways and the medical field okay it's used to sterilize the air and hard surfaces and pretty much every hospital throughout the United states\nUltraviolet light is used to sterilize water if you have a well you might actually use it to sterilize the wealth from bacteria\nThere used to sterilize food and for the last twenty five years or so ultraviolet light has been used in residential home heating and air conditioning systems why because\nOf ultraviolet lights unbelievable ability to destroy the nasty stuff we were just talking about things like molds and bacteria is that take up residence in your home heating and air conditioning system\nAnd guys mold is bad for you if you didn't get that from what we are talking about before the environmental protection agency says that if you know or suspect that you have mould and your heating and air conditioning system that you shouldn't operate the system\nHere the numbers dial quickly because they'd go quick seven to seven nine nine nine eight\nSeven nine nine nine

if you have somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes during a tune up\nFrankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too\nSo what do you want to do if you've got one of those companies well I'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you\nAsk them to have the technician give us sixty seconds heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone call and when you get that telephone call half of your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich get richer\nAnd as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay because you're really getting anything and in some cases they're\nDoing more harm than good you can't do it to end up in twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible now I'm offering this for Seventy nine dollars today but you only get one shot at it okay at least for the Seventy nine dollars from that point forward\nYou'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll be happy to pay the regular price and if you get set up in one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts and priorities surface almost everybody that we see gets one of the maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter is that everybody and I mean everybody in the Las Vegas area needs this I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil and your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to seem deal folks\nIf you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer if you want to keep the warranty and clean one runs so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all the time my ears blowing a lot harder is that normal well yeah we pulled out your blower you had as clean it it was all gung top it should be moving more air\nMy furnace in air conditioning system isn't running as much as it was\nWell that was part of the goal we don't want it to run this much that way your energy bills aren't as high end ... D you middle sized properly or humidifiers properly depending on the season\nQuick so that you know what you're going to get from a company like climate control experts\nThen I'm going to open up the phone lines again and allows some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for Seventy nine bucks and you're absolutely going to love the service I promise and remember I'm going to give you that Seventy nine bucks back\nOn the way out the door are actually going to give you your money back\nThen that crazy amazing\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technician to arrive\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let him in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat pump\nAnd he'll reach down and put on she covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's gonna wear those each time he enters your house they'll show you\nThe inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I see anything uh that's going to give you challenges in the future I'm On the market and this column over here\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can now once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working next to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit\nAt which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext as we get the leaves and sticks in mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and Ross out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of your unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle just sprayed down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right\nAnd it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass clippings in dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance is right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish\nIt can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started it's about to go bad\nAs a pending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or for him is\nWe'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right\nWe'll check all your hoses your drains your flame sensor and even run a little test on your ignite or to make sure that it's not about to go out on you when it gets cold All right because of that happens your house is going to get cold\nIn a hurry most importantly we're going to check your heated exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide DC now why I say that you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe're going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine we are going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there's if you have them let you know how your filters look and advice you whether or not there's something more time or cost effective\nAt the end of the day it's about making you more comfortable in your home and saving money All right so get it tuned up it doesn't cost you anything it actually pays you to do that alright get it cleaned up\nAnd look if you want to experience everything we've been talking about here on the radio without the risk of going in playing Google roulette I'm going to give five more of
