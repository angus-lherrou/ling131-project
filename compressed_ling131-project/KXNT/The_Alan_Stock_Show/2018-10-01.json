I used to twelve till nine\nSome reason I thought it was eleven and nine but I guess you know we got here about Lebanon and in the time frame just be can live a mishmash of times you know\nWell when we ... we did get here and eleven o'clock hour and our phones were\nLighting up from you know across the country mhm wanting to find out what's happening here\nSo we were trying to sort all that out before we went on air 'cause we were also trying to sort out what was happening\n'cause we didn't have as much information\nWe're getting calls from England if I recall you know you have to be interviewed\nThe many are so many of them that can't even name all\nYou know so I Want to take a look at what went on and where we've come from because uh you know the the slogan here in Las Vegas has been\nAt Las Vegas strong at Las Vegas strong and yet or if you look today at that slogan on online than anywhere else is now morphed into at Las Vegas stronger and stronger\nAnd so I mean you know the question is obviously have we become stronger in in the past year\nWhat do you think it's changed the most about Las Vegas in this past year\n\nAnd a ... out to play this for you because this is a ... one of the things that we heard as we turned on the police scanner or when we got into um the studio a year ago tonight\nWhen I was shocked to learn more and you know [noise]\nYou're not anyone shots fired from Maine as many people down state lab we share\nBecause of the impact that it had on us someone pointed out to me today that a lot of people who died were not from Las Vegas there from California they were from all around the world\nBut we experienced the pain here because this happened in our backyard ... a lot of us a lot of us drive by that particular location right near a Hacienda and in the strip almost every day to go to work ... whatever it is [noise]\nAnd uh we know that area I mean all of us instantly ... you know focused in that's where it was happening\n\nSo here we are you know ... we get the idea that this is happening we we make the decision among ourselves here\nTo come in and find out what was happening so we could reported on the air and this is what happened at twelve o three now again October first on a Sunday last year and twelve o three now was Monday October second when we hit the airwaves\nArt and the struggle three I'm Alan stock and we are here in the ... ... and the studios and we are staying on top of this latest situation that that has occurred the route Ninety One country festival right directly across the Mandalay Bay apparently there's been a a shooting that has occurred\nMultiple people have been shot we don't know the outcome exactly\nHow many people are are confirmed a a voted I Am getting some reports right now right this moment that are searching people as of now are dead\nOr that's what we are hearing right now a from a Katie envy and I'm trying to stay on top of this uh with them as well they have a reporters out on the scene\nAnd we do know that I'm multiple people who have been shot we're talking about perhaps perhaps off to dozens of people have been wounded or in the situation if you are not\nIn the area of the Mandalay Bay of the of the Las Vegas boulevard and Russell and how she ended up and Tropicana and that area please stay away\nBay of the of the Las Vegas boulevard and Russell and how she ends up and Tropicana and that area please stay away if you are in that area pleased hunkered down as much as possible because if we're not aware of whether or not they have\nYet got the shooter or shooters were not even aware how many people there were involved we only know that about an hour and a half ago there were approximately one or two shooters that began shooting from the top we believe of the Mandalay Bay the thirty second or third the third floor we believe\nAnd again a lot of this is is speculation and uh we do know that rapid fire occurred\nYeah the only correction that I spent an hour and a half of his fellow three and all that before but actually two hours almost exactly to the moment the shooting began but again we're trying to keep her which about us and give the information that was accurate to you\nI'm a I said Thirteen people confirmed it now we know fifty people would die I should perhaps dozens wounded\nMore than eight hundred injured [noise]\nSeven three three ... three three five nine six eight Lynn you're on Cape Cod welcome to the show\nHi Allan Hi Lynne this is how are you I'm okay\nWell I you know I'm Glad that you're you're asking for our input on you know what what thoughts we have on on this occurrence because um\nThere's so much negativity and I I Want to focus on one positive if we if we can and you know most of us are inland from other areas of the country no one ever looks at Vegas and says oh that's\nMy home town that the community they look at Vegas has a vacation spot where people come and get drunk and leave\n'em and I think this tragedy\nUs all realize that we are a community and we are very pride full of where we live and we we are you know we take care of each other and even if they were just visiting from California you know we consider 'em Dan our gas and um\nYou know look at look at what this has done for\nThe rise of pride in Vegas you know we we have the Golden Knights we cheer them on and that's what we needed and it you know it it made us realize we are a strong community and we do support each other and we do have more than just the strip 'em and we have a love for each other and respect for each other that\nUnfortunately took this tragedy I think for many people to realize\nYou know I ... is so true people I I Know they are and I guess we want to project it out there that when people think of Las Vegas strip to think of the lights\nThey think of the uh you know all the stuff going on in in in the restaurants they think of the shows they think of gambling they think of the parties and everything else that that that's all true people do a from around the country\nA lot of people don't realize of course that a lot of us rarely go to the strip or we we live on the strip it's like we live in a suburban community could be anywhere you as a\nAnd and for us um this was a hometown shooting if you lived in you know whatever the city if you lived in Seattle it happened there no matter what part of Seattle you would feel that this was impacting you personally and it's impacted us\nPersonally those of us who have who made Las Vegas so you said something very interesting too because a lot of us were not born here I was knocked right um you know my my my my grandchildren were but my children were not\nBut you know when people make a choice to become part of something oftentimes oftentimes they become more ... than people who were born into it\nIt's a choice to become part of something oftentimes oftentimes they become more ... than people who were born into it when you have people who are born to a religion\nAnd uh you know sometimes people take it for granted I'm this or that\nWhatever when people convert to her religion is because they made the choice after studying that religion they they want to convert to the same I I think we're living here in Las Vegas at the you know people can go ahead and be born here and that yeah I was born it was at school it was great cheap things way back that\nWe will make a choice to live here this is my twenty year here this is my home forever and what we will make a choice to live here\nYou know it becomes a situation where are you made that choice consciously and you want to become a part of this community and it's it's a different feeling than if you're born anew adamantly\nAbsolutely and and I you know my family we all came out here my parents my husband and my daughter we all moved out here from New York and you know we we wanted to live here and we love to every second of it and you know when this tragedy struck\nI'm the first thing I thought my God that's my home this is my home and you know this is my community and um\nAnd it just increased my pride I was so\nGlad to be able to say I live here and these people that were heroes and\nTook charge and you know regular everyday people that were helping 'em those people shot and and not expecting to ever spend the evening dealing that those are my neighbor than my friends and and you know and I I have a lot of pride for this community and I don't take that for granted because you know we're forever\nChanged we Are Forever changed butler bonded by this\nSo when I asked the question you know what do you think has changed the most of the Las Vegas for the past year we become much stronger as a community\nAs a community absolutely and we we have something that unites all um and will forever and um we will I think we have become more supportive of each other as a community more tolerant of each other and um and definitely it's it's it's really made us stronger a stronger yen\nLynn thank you so much for your call I appreciate it very much that you kicked it off this afternoon for saying you so much to please call back anytime at all seven three three kids and two seven three three five nine six eight\nYears ago I say has become strong in the past year what has changed the most about Las Vegas in the past year I Want to get to your calls more coming up and just told and I've got some more thoughts in some more clips of the places that night they kiss you forgotten right\nBut I Want to read my view about something else you know we talked about security we talk about this new to your family is safe and secure you want to make sure that no one has the opportunity ... opportunity to break into your home that's that's the bottom line\nYou can have cameras you can have alarms you can have dogs and guns you can have a lot of things\nBut here's the bottom line if somebody wants to do harm they first got to break into your home you want to make sure that that does not happen from the from the get go and and the whole breaking occurs every sixteen sectors of the u._s. Las Vegas crime rates are high we know that\nHow can you protect your family well security screen masters is the only security system that will guarantee no break ins\nAgain while I'm systems video cameras cannot physically prevent a break in and they'll never guarantee against the breaking\nThe security should be masters produce screens that are made of solid steel unbreakable physical barrier that so they can actually guarantee\nAgainst the breaking you can enjoy the fresh cool nighttime or this fall each and every night with security screen masters sleep with the windows wide open in your security screens will keep out any would be intruders\nFresh cool nighttime or this fall each and every night with security screen masters sleep with the windows wide open in your security screens will keep out any would be intruders a hundred percent guaranteed I've only got so much time to tell you just how greatly screens are so for a free security inspection of your home in a\nComplementary demonstration mentioned minding our stock when you call five times zero Seventy eight forty eight five zero Seventy eight forty you must see it to believe it\nFive zero Seventy eight forty eight it's the original security screen masters\nAnd there were different firearms being used and um so I mean I mean this is number one number two\nYou know I really believe that um given the fact that you have the uh Mandalay Bay and the lecture next to it you did have a sense of echo going on we know now\nThat there was one shooting once shooter and one shooter only and we don't mention him by name maybe that's what he wanted ... I Will never know I mean what the reason was behind\nOnly and we don't mention him by name maybe that's what he wanted ... I Will never know I mean what the reason was behind this guy's shooting\nBut we know it was one shooter metro has done an exhaustive investigation FBI supposedly coming out with their uh ... cost of investigation by the end of this year the\nMetros already laid this out for us pretty much\nPretty much\nWhat we had to rely on was the accuracy of what you were telling us not to listen to innuendo and rumor did not want to take a these rumors that were that were there were going on didn't want to do that\nBecause that is a you know I mean\nThat was the last thing that we wanted to do there were people out there in certain media that were you know I I think they were just dripping if the idea of being able to talk about the uh the conspiracy that was going on the multiple shooters\nOccurring at the ... up and down the strip up and down the strip but we know that was not the case didn't happen\nAnd the result of course was that a lot of misinformation came out a lot of people believed different things as they were going on\n\nI'm gonna give me an example is one guy that was it the Cosmo the call this that night from the Cosmo\nI was at a cosmopolitan at the time and um everybody was just kind of like paranoid nobody knew what was going on um they were pushing people away from the windows um they thought they were going to they were going to shoot the windows right there and um\nEvery everything turned out okay then everybody's saying that a hotel safe and they locked it down and not letting nobody in or out I'm\nStiff was there any ... any shots fired your way toward the cosmopolitan\nNo no there was any um any shots fired it was ... it it sounded like a lotta here say a lot of people same thing but nothing nothing happened over there\nYou hear that a lot of here say a lot of people saying things\nAnd we made a conscious decision here and I I I'm ... I'm proud that we do this\nWe we're not going to go along with hearsay and rumors and all the crap that was out there trying to get people all fired up in a circle yes they close to strip down yes they found a body at a drop in in in in strip\nBut it was some eyes that a person who was shot at the Ninety One festival\nAnd then wandered down to drop and died there which made some people think that there were shootings going on at the proper right near there\n[noise]\nSeven three three cats and two seven three three five nine six eight Judy you're on K ex ante welcome to the show this afternoon\n[noise] hey Alan how're you doing I'm doing well thank you for calling in okay well I'd like to make a couple of comments sure\nI have lived in Las Vegas sixty one years so you've been in for a while Trump born and raised okay which came to Las Vegas in Nineteen forty eight wow are there were Twenty one thousand people here that [noise] so I I was an executive in that hotel business here\nAnd I would say that [noise]\nSo I I was an executive and the hotel business here and I would say this I have seen this community\nPulled together time and time again most of the country has no idea [noise]\nBack in Nineteen eighty one in November we had a horrific tragedy happened with the MGM hotel fire chef and ... say the whole town turned out I was working at a hotel casinos we sent sandwiches over for twelve thousand people\nWhile at the right of\nCenter and organize blood drives in other words what I'm trying to say I have seen this before we have lots of people when flood's before the retention a sense we at pat her rhetoric thing happened the community has always been strong always pulled together\nYou see them all your museum of last year a it has become stronger and and if not then what is what if anything maybe nothing what do you think is maybe changed my Las Vegas in the past year I think\nI I'll tell you what I think and when they had a spot on a lot of people are transplants right Las Vegas most up\n[noise] and I think\nThey're amazed at what a sense of community we do have I've always known it but I Would say what has changed and it I I see it dramatically with us and said that\nThe the sense of awareness in the sense of vulnerability we are as vulnerable as or lamb no or pioneer square in Portland or New York city at nine eleven\nA lot of people have a a terrible false sense of security in Las Vegas they think the hotels are impenetrable because of the heavy security and the cameras and everybody's watching\nIf someone wants to do something truly awful don't matter what you do it's going to happen now that doesn't mean you can't take precautions but ah I I think we became aware that we are as vulnerable\nAnd just like New York pulled together just like Orlando pulled together we pulled together\nSo you've been a big one of the biggest changes over the last year is as the awareness that we it'd be that we are really more vulnerable than we could have imagined\nOh certainly and Allen I can tell you this back during nine eleven uh I don't I don't believe he may have been in the community and\nI certainly was\nThe biggest talk was about some of those terrorists staying down\nJust south of the strip right as Sarah they were scoping out the stratosphere they were scoping out\nThose ... those ... that was the one of the science of the time I remember that\nAnd ah I can also tell you\nThat uh uh you know they had them on film they had pictures of it remember to what little out of that off balance workload where's Saddam and the more they want to make a statement bigger than anything against Las Vegas believe me and\nAh I I I I just believe in and I've watched every one pulled together at nine eleven all the hotels people put leave people were out of money it was after a weekend\nOnly me everybody went above and beyond\nI I Do remember I was here and they got the call early in the morning from a friend of mine northern California I came in and then they broadcast from noon until seven ... hours on the air um and and so I I mean I remember very very very well um and and and we were\nThe noon until seven straight seven straight hours on the air um and and so I I mean I remember it very very very well um and and and we were it was a traumatic event that occurred uh nine eleven two thousand and one\nThe difference I think between that and would occur to your go to tonight was that this occurred they'll tell you about the shooter a year ago in our community we drive by your everyday and it wasn't like a ...\nIt wasn't ... yeah that would also\nSay alec back in Nineteen eighty with the GM fire ... we were taking it hotel guests every hotel with so that we were clothing eating them contacting their relatives a\nAthlete buddy put together because unfortunately of course Seventy Kelly there were a lot of one day and a lot of people shell shocked the hotel but it sold out right and uh I mean I have seen this rally time and time again and I think what I Love to\nSee more than anything on this anniversary they get strong yeah Vegas stronger Vegas Las Vegas is a very strong anti oriented\nI I agree with you know a small town but lately where we still have a lot of small town in us\nI I Know I I was and I I've chosen screen do you have lived here all your life I've chosen and I I feel everything you say I Love this community and I've lived in some great communities by the way and I've never felt anything like I feel you have ...\nState gets twice and always keep\n[laughter] Judy ...

and many other instances the big fire at the at the MGM years ago were more people actually died they died a year ago with the shooting\nIn the community came together and I remember I remember the community coming together on nine eleven and two thousand and one\nI don't like the sound I have to watch it with the sounds of windows closing for some reason I it just chicken fireworks I Can't go to baseball games we ought to fifty one and I didn't even know it was going to hit me until\nOn they started doing fireworks and I started crying 'cause I it just brought me back to that moment and\nYou try and like push on and there's things that will happen but I just kind of try and keep calm but I keep it to myself I ... get a lot around other people because I Do other\nThan your husband's as you two went through this document or something it's mostly the bonding moment but this is not something that would one would assume you just got married last week ... this is something that you understand in each other to see go through the same thing\nHe does for him it I think he dealt with it differently for sure we both share survivor's guilt and I think we still do for him it was hard because he is in the medical field so it was hard for him to leave and not want to like not go back and help people but\nYou know his first priority was getting us out and getting me out and a lot of people think if I wasn't there with him he would have gone back just like many people with you correct and so\nThat's that's a hard pill for him to swallow I think and that's hard for me to think about as well\nDo you know every single person that I've talked to survived ... has your guilt exact same guilt every single person shouldn't why not me why did the person not make it yeah\nBecause you look at all these beautiful fifty eight people who passed and a lot of them was way too they were way too young and you know\nBorn and raised in Las Vegas it's like you're connected to these people like everybody knows everybody no matter how big the city is and you know it's it's really hard to see it was great to see it coming to come together but it's a shame that it had to happen in such a tragic way\nAnd you look at all these people who were selfless and can show the people who they didn't even know and you know people lost their moms and dads and their brothers and sisters and\nDaughters and son was husbands and wives like it's hard if kids yeah it it's it's extremely hard and you feel guilty because they had so much to live for or they were doing to fight in their lives at that moment ... newly married and\nYou know starting their careers and they're so excited so happy and how can that be ripped away and you're looking bull why did I say why didn't I get\nShot or you know it's not being a survivor nobody kind of it's not a joy to be a part of that club in a sense it's\nIt's horrifying you want to live for those fifty eight people and keep pushing through and not let the evil when it's just you have to pick your battles and you have to\nTry and push on even the darkest moment and tell yourself it's going to be okay\nWe're talking with a zero Tobe a choose a survivor of one on October and she works with us here at her calm\nAnd that's my next point there are survivors among us and many of them like yourself don't talk about it\nAnd some people knew about it on newer here and we don't really know each other [noise] ah I'd walk by you in the hallway are I Would have no idea what\nAre you doing for you what are you and your husband doing for a for each other I mean are you going to therapy and if not wanting to\nKnow we have not gone to therapy yet I looking to do that um we both are he offered to go with me as well but I think so much happened last year and I wasn't ready to\nFully dive into 'em what had happened and kind of process it kind of I think scares me to to go where you live at to go there yes and especially with\nTo um what had happened in kind of process it kind of I think scares me to to go where you live it to go there yes and especially with\nA complete stranger to be vulnerable and let them know the vivid nightmares and all the triggers and what we go through on a day to day basis on it's a little\nHard for me chicken finding somebody when my trust has been\n... violated exactly we're talking with Derrick towel but she is a survivor of\nThe route Ninety One shooting she is a co worker of ours here at intercom radio well I'm going to guess that one of the reasons why you haven't wanted to do it as well as you have gone from an evening that was having with the love of your life\nTo an instant nightmare to surviving that nightmare still living with it but aiming for what you did that was the whole reason why you were there that night finally getting married in the last thing you would want to do and just 'cause I'm you're being being your armchair therapist and I don't charge much just like\nYou don't want the lead up to your marriage and the excitement of rides always have with their with their weddings ... be stained by this horrible you know they have this dark cloud over it with with therapy I might it might hit the nail\nYes okay yeah I my first concert actually since one October was in June and it was for another ... country concert it's fair ... at the green valley ranch\nThat seemed like a little harder things id because the studying is around the hotel with all the rooms and I did look around had a little bit of anxiety\nAnd we went by I kind of I got through that with a little hard because I'm thinking if something happened you have tons of security around\nBut you just never know I think that fear kind of gets you a little bit but we made it through I was definitely more observant for sure and kind of like watched but\nCountry music helps a little bit too doesn't it it it's the best would you go CJ smelting concert again\nYes I Would love to um yeah last time we dance to what's at MIT Ninety One and then our first dance was chasing al deen you make it easy\nSo now I'm going to start [laughter] I dare I\nTell but I don't want to get in trouble for keeping you away from the other thing that you're doing here at the company thank you so much a we're here for you know we don't see each other very much but ah to contemplate going and talking to somebody because you did great here I consider this your first therapy session thank you so much\nMichael cast of this morning with a day or a colleague of ours here in a crime radio and

of thirty two seats in the house of representatives and two in the Senate We're in for what will be a wild political season and there's going to be plenty to discuss and debate and dissect\nDo you think that that should be reopened and that there should be 'cause I I don't know my I don't know what your opinion is but mine is I thought it would have been great you ... I Am now like you know so many people lost their lives there and it's a it's a very sensitive subject but I always thought that it should have been reopened it maybe they should have done some huge show to raise money for charity for\nFor the families and the people that lost their lives\nYou know I think they were I if I if I'm not mistaken I thought they were going to use it they're going to try to use it for a a a police\nType of station of some kind\nAnd then I became aware of the fact that that area a lot of an area a was a was sold off to a couple of developers and that can be putting a huge resorts there so I don't know I'm not sure if they're going to I'm not sure what they're going to be doing exactly with that particular spot\nI'm ... I understand what you're saying about using it by the way as a a a as a venue again as if to say you know we're not going to be bullied into or being able to live our our lives and and I think I think that's very wise view and compassionate um I I\nI think that would be good I just one other thing I mean but I think I think it's\nI think that's important I think what it is important also um is that I'm no matter what we do with that particular venue is that we are at the end of the downtown they've they've initiated a memorial that's going to be there forever supposedly ... and I think that should be\nI I think the most important thing out of this is that uh people have come together and those of us who did not live here before like I went in Ninety nine a woman was here for its during the MGM fire which I was not\nBut again this is an event that has brought this community together and I think uh this is one of the strongest and most compassionate communities I've ever been to ... lived in in my life and I think we you and me Bryan we're very fortunate\nTo be living here I've got to run but I appreciate your call this afternoon seven three three cats and two seven three three five nine six eight\nAnd if you want to give us an idea of what you think um\nWhat should we deal with that area that was a good question he brought up\nBut I think another big question is and you heard from the interview that Michael conducted this morning with a Daraa who works with us as you said has been heightened it outdoor festivals outdoor gatherings first as she's after shooting she she saw she she knew understood what was what was happening and at her\nI suppose outdoor gatherings first as she was after shooting she she saw she she knew understood what was what was happening and at her census had been heightened big time at any any outdoor gatherings and I'm not sure if those of us who are not there whether we've gone through that kind of a change\nWhich I think maybe unfortunate because I think that uh\nIt's an opportunity for us to be able to think about using that as a guide where we are in places that are outdoors do we take more time to be aware of our surroundings or have we forgotten what occurred a year ago and even momentarily and that was me and I\nI Do and I will be an outdoor area are gathering at various places we've been\nI I honestly I don't think about it\nWasn't I wasn't there at that moment so I mean I'm not thinking automatically about what's what's what's happening\nI Do know that the uh events that occurred right afterwards like the veterans' day parade um there were we had various police and sharp shooters uh various buildings surrounding the parade and the review stand that we have every year I um\nAnd I know there were some people last year who are concerned and did not show up at the Veterans Day parade which you know it was always on veterans' day which is eleven eleven\nAh November eleventh this year happens to be on a Sunday no reason you shouldn't come out for it and and that's part of my point I think that the idea of being able to uh come on out\nAnd purposely this year\nOf all years to come on out and be part of the Veterans Day parade which is a great way to be able to honor veterans and last year we also first responders because I think they well deserved it\nBut to have a honor the veterans first respond as people in uniform people who've served in uniform\nOr even to appreciate the young people and and the ROTC that come out reforms their um their their movements for us at the review stand I encourage you to do it it's not going to be on Sunday by the way on November eleventh and it starts at ten o'clock\nKicks off from around um fourth in gas right around there and goes down to four than other our review standards on fourth in Ogden\nAnd uh it is any credible parade it's the second largest Veterans Day parade in the nation\nSo not only does\nCommunity come together when there's a tragedy shooting of police officers and as it happened and I'm ... and tragedies with the fires and hotels and the shooting that occur at a year ago but also this community comes together to build on our men and women in uniform\nAnd they have done that for a ... we've done that his community for all these years my twentieth year I Am seeing as the events and um\nYou know I encourage you to come on out and be part of the celebration\nOf people in uniform really an incredible events and I think you'll be very very happy that again it's on Sunday November eleventh this year it's eleven eleven every as the ... starts at low before ten o'clock the invocation and and the national anthem\nKick off at a about a quarter to tend to ten o'clock and it goes to about the twelve thirty so come for a while I'll watch the opening stay as long as you want if you want to leave at some point badly but otherwise You're welcome to stay for the entire parade and I think you're going to um uh enjoy
