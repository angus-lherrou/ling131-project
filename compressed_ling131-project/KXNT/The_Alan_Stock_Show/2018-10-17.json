agreements for example\nAnd the cost associated with that there are significant cost which is estimated by the public utilities commission to be about four billion dollars that cost would be passed on to write pairs and consumers across the state\nI quickly I Want to clarify real quickly they would be you're saying that would be forced to divest and John you're saying\nNothing in that if you read that Alan would you do there is nothing in that the forces\nBerkeley they would be you're sitting there be forced to divest and John you're saying nothing\nIn that if you read that element you did there was nothing in that the forces them to divest so it's very clear that they don't have to they don't have to they could be emerging vent generator they just couldn't be the only generator that's all that's actually why would they be forced to divest if it's not specified in this question\nWell the the ... center has even concluded that in their ... and the report they did on questions raised about so two independent reports are concluding this as well that the reality is if and the energy of questions we passes\nAnd the energy cannot remain that that that type of company they are today if they did they would have that competitive advantage and be infringing on the on the ballot me a measure of language as it stands and is that it's written so it would force them to tie that to me that I don't know I Know that are part of having to say that\nI'm trying to understand is I I just want to clarify this so we can move out to be also\n... ... what where does it say that that they have to the vet and you're saying by um uh but based upon the the conclusion of people who've done it better than they would divest but I'm asking you are going to be forced to do that and there was legally they're not going to be required to divest ...\nYou know they they would because yes question three pounds\nOn and I know John and I disagree on the court if questions revert to pass and the energy if they did not die that's they're generating facilities they will still own and operate the polls and wire paid our generation the generating facility right if they did not take that says and sell those off which they would you first two\nAnd questioned three ... path they would have therefore I competitive advantage which would be infringing on the constitutional amendment that would be passed with\nQuestions or will not let me let ... let me give you a little back waiting for them as ... as she said I just want to get her both you and I mean it would be a little background I've been a regular ... to them about it for forty years okay\nI was a state consumer advocate Nevada I was general counsel to them about a public utilities commission I think I Would know whether or not they would have to legally divest under this constitutional amendment and I can guarantee you that they don't have to divest under this with me is that I see that's my that's my legal opinion as\nTracy put a vote would they be required because they would have a competitive advantage you know there would be forced to on the dollar store you know you're saying though and you're saying that in the\n... the immigrant center must be wrong in their independent and that's a good trade reports on questions or jog\nWell again the PC chairman who did the report is no longer there he was only there for a year he had no regulatory experience whatsoever none whatsoever he was only with the commission for the year and ultimately the commission didn't say they will be forced to divest the commission said if they did divest there may be some\nSales made of those assets in those sales would have to be worked out\nWhat are stranded costs what does that her name I mean ... what is quick what is being threatened costs me if you have an asset\nAnd you are\nSelling that ousted out in the market\nIf you have to sell that sit and below market costs the difference is the stranded cost\nIf in fact you sell it and above market costs to stranded benefits so whether or not they sell it's up to and the energy to determine nevertheless I Would agree we'd have to compensate them for all these investment\nMonetarily envy energy yes because because right now I Would say some for well we're compensating\nThem right now in our rates in other words all of those generating plants that they have out there those are all better than our rates so if they decide to sell them and that's a decision they can make and depending upon how that Syria was made then we will secure ties\nTo sell them and that's a decision they can make and depending upon how that Syria was made then we will secure ties those costs of the time and in essence keep those in our rates overall so\nThat's how we would pay ... I'm just asking so the the consumer would pay those dreaded rates were paying them now I I'm just asking here I'm trying to understand there's I mean us yes\nSo that you you know you referenced is rented out that's not not comes from on the report the public utilities commission did do unquestioned three that reference\nThey concluded on in in the report that if questions are eager to pass as I said they would have to ... you can try and slice it any way you want they would have to have that um that costs associated with that thing they're generating facilities and selling off as long term her participate in saving lives today it's\nGoing to be four billion dollars in a stranded asset costs that would then be passed on to to consumers for as we're showing that rise are short so and you could say technically we are but the problem if questioned three passes and then the energy self that\nSay if someone comes in and buy a facility they don't have to keep that energy here in the state of Nevada they can sell it to the highest bidder somewhere else in a different state for that electricity and we would still be on the hook for paying for that so that's one of the biggest concern this trend that such a hard cause that would be passed on and the theory is\nJust trying to start assets are are are the generating a facility that generates the electricity solve the power itself a John what if they would come in there and and the buyer and then shipped to the energy to Mexico or California\nAnd they and they get a higher price for it than than they would normally be stranded assets they will be a benefit and we would get the benefits back so with Tracy's says ... is going to happen uh ultimately we would have a benefit there would be no cost there will be a benefit because it'd be selling them in the higher price but we wouldn't be on the market\nWe would not be by the ... that energy ourselves though we could possibly I'm just saying we wish we could\nWe we we could but ultimately again the issue is we are on the hook for that now so there is no incremental additional costs that we're going to pay if we go to a restructured competitive system\nRight here's what we assume costs we have to take a quick time out we come back I I you know what I Want to tackle them and I want to get you involved with what I Want to tackle is they both told us that we're going to save money we both are way\nHow's that possible uh we'll see what else would you find that out I mean are they I don't know I don't know\nBut I Want to find out we come back for four billion dollar question that is the that's the big billion dollar question exactly if you want to join in Seventy three cats that these seven three three five and six eight we are broadcasting live from the ... you know it's the jewels Henderson around here with the Jim Brooks are are ah my co hosting the owner operator they have a casino and\nWe're out here uh with John willing Hoffa Tracy scanning door there are debating the issue of questioning three you want to give you a chance to get your questions answer if you want to come out that would be of all I can see you know we've got an open like for you as well much more coming up on our big questions ... debate next a new talking forty AM X and the\nPolitical powerhouse meet the press comes to Las Vegas host Chuck Todd tells us why isn't it better races will be the ones to watch an election night and Twitter is already uncovered for an election interference Russia isn't the only culprit Michael Kastner we'll talk about starting at six tomorrow morning I wake up Las Vegas\n[noise] the foreign Robert Robert somebody burned down my she shed\nNo one burned down she sheds Cheryl O'Reilly factor because my she she had burning up in the backyard here she was struck by lightning Cheryl Robert ...

of a question to ask but um if this passes it becomes a constitutional amendment and I'm I'm just waiting side as I understand if I'm playing this wrong both correctly but then it goes up to the legislature\nBecomes a constitutional amendment and I'm I'm just waiting side as I understand if I'm playing this wrong you both correctly but then it goes up to the legislature to determine how it's implemented\nAlright important question that I have because I'm a consumer or it's just a lay person or do I know about this stuff what consumer protections are built into this John\nWill ultimately the legislature could build in multiple protections which they would do which they've seen in other states as as we've seen in in the number of them including um\nJim ... you're very important question to ask questions so as a as a small business\nOwner I don't have the the the ability like the big guys to go out and and do what they did so how am I going how how was it ... what's going to cost me as a business owner for ... and as a proud residents to go out and get a other energy from another source of the Indians\nWell it's not going to cost you anything to be just to be multiple providers who provide offers to you both as a business owner and as a residential customers so you'll have the opportunity to go out and shop\nAnd not only shots of price and this is the key but you also be able to shop for different attributes of the service so you could get a hundred percent renewables\nYou also be able to shop for different attributes of the service so you could get a hundred percent renewables if you want it\nI Know guy a friend of mine who's a former chairman of the text but we do this commission getting a hundred percent ... and used and seven point four cents a kilowatt hour versus the twelve point something sincere\nSo you can get a hundred percent ... if you want to for your business or you want to make sure that your rates are going to stay stable over long periods of time because you're concerned about you know your fluctuating costs with your casino here\nSo you could lock in a three to five year contract\nI'm gonna get just flat rate for this during the time I Know my rate will be you have attributes that you can walk into the multiple options that you can go choose lawyer rates make sure that you get the kinds of right that you want to kind of contract that you want and ultimately you know when you when you do for your what's your what are you said multiple\nHow many do you have any idea of how many ... ultimately\nIn in Texas there's a about fifty one different providers\nAre so you know multiple providers now they may not be for every business and for every residential customers are but there are multiple providers\nTraits in question to you that uh that that that you can I ask that is that of what's going to cost him to be able to go out as a resident a residential ... Henderson as well as a a small business or what's going to cost him to be able to shop around for an alternative energy\nShirt so so a couple of things there again and we we've talked about this a few times now in the deregulated states we have seen 'em for you as a as a residential consumer myself and all of a sitting here as well as for you is a small business owner\nAnd electricity rates are higher in this deregulated states there are thirty percent higher than Nevada's rates today um and so that's first and foremost the first point the second point as I'm In\nThe options that that that the proponents talk about these contracts are very confusing as we've identified some of these examples where\nThese suppose that contracts an auction um would be available to you it's not that simple and and the reality is I'm In the markets like Massachusetts in the markets like like Texas the consumers\nUm are somewhat confused on and they think they're getting one right but the second they go over a certain amount of electricity huge usage per kilowatt on any given month you're right actually goes up two to three times so it's no different than like yourself you know the old data plans right with cell phones\nOn do you think you have a great you have a data plan that if you go over those minutes your bills like two to three times higher it's very similar concept and I just want to add just this week that Henderson chamber of commerce came out opposing questioned three because they are representing thousands of Henderson you know small businesses\nThat are concerned about this and they oppose it for like let\nMe ask you this I I just want to get a yes or no from Bovey okay yes or no um what she was asking what a piggy back on that real quick\nOr what he was asking what would it cost him top that we know that uh the sands in ... and when in MGM have all opted out and they paid hundreds of millions of dollars in order to get out of it we know that now a let's say yes passes\nOr will it cost to him and his business anything to opt out of envy energy like it costs I mean won't be any fee involved opting out as they had to pay that that at the uh the the pullout so and and and we're a yes or no\nNo no they would not object I Would love to go to fall as we've gotten agreement here we don't really agree on something like that is already has All right great\nWant to get the answer I got to go to the phones to start out with the ... but only the longest thanks so much for your patience or Billy or on K ... anti welcome to the show and you have a quick question surf\nWas involved in the deregulation of the long distance in the street remember when you couldn't make a phone call was so much they deregulated what are you at ...\nI was involved in the deregulation of the long distance in the street remember when you couldn't make a phone call with so much they deregulated what have you had companies sending you check your customers the dares went down to ... minute whatever they have higher like maybe they have hired yeah\nWhat is the gas as opposed to a cause some states have higher cost\nRight did you ever questioned real quick or you wouldn't want to make that point right\nI Know I I I stay open up the competition I think I've been here since Nineteen eighty electric bill is my third I still have my rent I got my car payment electric bill is higher than\nMigration appreciate your call thank you very much for joining us afternoon a question for Tracy for you um if I'm\nIf a a ... bringing up about the about the ... the costs of of phone calls you know when we've had\nA good point too ... says we've had a plethora of um a phone companies are options that we've had\nPhone rates have gone down in the course folks who got smaller to remember the big ones\nAnd and the rates used to be and they used to charge you\nFor a texting and so much or texting or certain types of data tax and then certain uh the charge you for uh how many minutes you have the daytime versus the nighttime when nobody has any way and eventually when the competition came into play and we had many many more options for cell phones which we have now\nTo buy as well as service the costs are down and you can make calls anytime they text all you want and the call the costs are way there are a fraction of what we used to pay enough we use that as a as a match against the deregulation concept wouldn't a\nPlethora of choices also bring down the cost of energy by giving us those those options you\nKnow and and I think it's it's not an accurate comparison imply why because electricity is not your normal goods and services so you can't compare it to us on our cable or or\nThings of that nature it's mark comparing it to what happened to the airline industry that's a better comparison because when on they deregulated you go on line today shopping for an airline ticket you think you're getting it for I don't know Nineteen I box by the time you check out there is like sixty or fifty ... ... dollars in fees on your show\nThat's a better comparison that's point number one point number two is on electricity require significant investments in the infrastructure so that the consumers have a reliable system is able to that\nOkay so um when you deregulated market\nCompetitors and anti electricity providers would enter the market they're not going to make the same investment and that's millions of dollars in a state so that here in Nevada we can have access to to ...\n... that's the second point I Want to get to the last one you know the first one John let me have your address what what what Tracy said my my my example is false you cannot compare it to the to the the the cell phone in the streets better comparing it\nTo the airline industry and the airline industry we we buy a ticket now and then if you want a pillow or a blanket or you know a glass of water you got to pay all kinds of money yes I\nI Choose southwest I don't have to do that All right and that's because there's competition I have an opportunity to go choose a different airline if I Want to and I think\nThe airline example and the telephone example are very happy examples because both of them show the power of competition and the power of choice you have the opportunity to save money and you also have the ... the opportunity to have options would kind of options you want to choose so you know I I don't agree with this this ...\nSaying the cell phone example in the airline example are the same based upon the idea that you make a choice you know he says on the best deal yes yes yes\nSo this ... you say leave their cell phones example in the airline example of the same based upon the idea that you make a choice you know he says I'm the best deal yes yes yes because we\nHave and yeah you you don't have to have somebody tell you what to do or tell you what price you're going to pay what service you're going to take 'cause that's what envy energy does now we don't need that we need to ultimately have Joyce\nAll right we've got a John willing off at ... at the end all I Would just you know the jewel of evidence and as we debate the issue of questions three now I Know that the phones back\nAnd so as much as I got many questions asked\nI Would defer to you the rest of the show is gonna be yours I'm going to get the calls on

and download today on radio dot com and I you\nKnow a page from the diary of low\nRetail competitive choice and we don't want electric monopoly with that's with the amendment does that's what it needs\nSome traces of responding to the first I Want to ask you to go back to back up on this quickly sure looking back based upon what Carroll said looking back if you had to do it all over again would you have had a situation where you did spell the plan out ahead of\nTime absolutely not because you don't want to lock that in the constitution which you want to lock in the constitution is the fact that ultimately the people are directing the legislature to put in place a competitive choice system\nFor the state of Nevada that's simply we want to you know everybody wants and needs competition and that's what we need to put in in the amendment beyond that the details tells the plant certainly need to be worked out by the legislature these governors committee who's working them out you know similarly we can do that here\nAre going to say we don't have a plan and that's the concern that a lot of voters in about ...\nThe only planet proponents have had said it is that they would read it to the state legislator and the court said the term in how to figure this out so it's no different than you buying a house and only seen the outside and not buying it without seeing anything on the inside of that ...\nThat is what question three is proposing it is simply proposing that we deregulated our electricity market but beyond that we literally have no idea what we're voting on\nOur let me go to the phones and this is actually from Dallas texas Laura's calling from Dallas texas last year I K ex ante welcome to the show Laura ...\nHey what's going on our\n... are doing OK yeah you've got we've got a very long time so you have a question of shark I\nYeah I have a forester now to ... I'm In Dallas out the whole and not only\nThey were deregulated from checks you to a different utility company and I chose green energy my light bill went from a hundred and forty two dollars down the eighty bucks\nNow I live here in Las Vegas presently right now and I live with a studio go back and forth and I was in the energy to a hundred and forty five dollars a month for one studio apartment downtown\nSo I Want to know why is that bill so high if al ... says they have a raise the rates I've been back and forth there for five years\nOr ... or ... or whatever the whole I mean every hold on a second one that trace you want to respond worst sure it's I think that\nAnd back and forth for five years or ... or ... or wherever your whole or wherever you hold on a second we'll get a trace you want to respond wars\nSure it's I think that the it's important to look at the vast majority of consumers across\nOn taxes they have experienced higher electricity rates on and and your point about on and the energies rates going up again they have not increased their rate 'em so since two thousand I as I said it before our rates haven't talk on down by Fifteen Percent\nUm you could even compare your bills you know I I have some from from years ago that I compared and and the electricity rate per kilowatt is the same rates of not increased here in the state of Nevada\nSo um I I don't know exactly which provider you're on um I I think if I heard you you said you're in the Houston area\nUh nobody here he's talking about is what he's paying it as one or sorry what studio for ... years paying two hundred and forty five dollars and he said for a studio here did you say that\nOne or forty five dollars a month and a lot of sort of ... from from the energy for ... and ... and beyond your or real quickly what are we ...\nYeah ... yeah ... ... I was wondering\nIf you've got all green energy you're paying eight bucks for a one bedroom house you're making my boys laws and that is the rates are lower in Texas much lower than they are here there is no data to show anything otherwise and the fact is that because there's competition there\nLaura's appreciate your call my friends that you so much for joining us if we do call again some three three cats that day mark your ex ante welcome to the show the stuff to mark\n... taking my call my understanding right now yes over a year old you are not allowed right now have a battery backed up the debtor extra energy has to go to the energy that you pay to get it that night that's clearly if this bill passes would be able to\nA ... a building have your own backup battery so it\nIt essentially you know get off the grid\nYou you will absolutely be able to get off the grid you can use that battery backup and your rooftop solar to provide energy to your neighbor if you want to openly you'll have all those options that you don't have no in fact envy energy would like to take away\nYour roof ... dots or they tried to do that a couple of years ago was stopped them from going all the way they still\nAre fought in the legislature and just the last session and we didn't get it all the way back but this amendment we'll put it back so you have those property rights re instilled for you ...\nThat that's not entirely correct so with the customers that have rooftop solar they receive a rebate and incentive um as part of their net metering program\nAssemblymen Chris Rock's who wrote an author that language and not Dylan twenty sixteen oppose this question three because the reality is if this passes it will completely dismantled the rooftop solar program the way it stands today\nThe other point is if it passes the electricity providers on that that could enter this market would have\nI there's nothing to say that they have to take on a rooftop solar customers so there's a lot of concerns of risks associated with that the third point is\nBattery storage storage has not been readily available anywhere really and so it's kind of a new thing that that is becoming more available Marta ... today and ... and ... and the energy doesn't have plans to make that available to customers in the near future\nOr whatever so real quick yeah I'd be happy to respond that's not true but it's just been said absolutely not true net metering we'll be taking care of in fact it's already been taking care of him a provision of the buildup Christ will put together\nSection twenty eight point seven of ab four or five specifically says that new retail providers will in fact have to comply with the net metering laws so the problem is if he says it into law\nFour or five specifically says that new retail providers will in fact have to comply with the net metering laws so the problem is if he says it in the law is taking care of\nArizona and assembly member himself without being misquoted by John Will tell you he opposes is because the fact that this is a constitutional amendment it changes the language of our state constitution that supersedes anything that came before it including the net metering language\nMore of your calls coming up in just a moment broadcast live near ... you know it's a great question the three debates right around
