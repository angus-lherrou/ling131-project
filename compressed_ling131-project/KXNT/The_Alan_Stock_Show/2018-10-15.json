I think it was ...\nAt best golf before before the country where it's going on I decided to go a Republican largely because of the Texas that I see going on and I do really and I am educated I'm a

band or your friend here uh love the show a quick question uh what kind of happened twenty twenty four when uh Michelle Obama decides to run and we heard him with a must come release of rice\n[laughter] I mean who knows what's gonna happen in twenty twenty four the only thing I carry about is the election it's less than a month away\nA winning that election because Democrats have already said what they care about they they said if you give us control of one chamber of Congress the house and Senate we will start the impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh\nAnd they also said that they ... they will do everything I can impeach Donald Trump I mean this is this is the party that will do anything they possibly can to overturn\nA free and fair elections Donald Trump and the people he appoints Brett Kavanaugh two positions and that's the part that that I I worry about I Can't I I really and then as soon as that's over I'm going to be focused on the next president's election because\nLook if if Brett Kavanaugh and the character assassination of cat Kevin I wouldn't have taken place I'll be honest with you I think the Republicans would have lost\nThe Senate I think Republicans were reminded\nOf just how violent just how evil the Democratic party is with the character assassination of Brett Kavanaugh he's a rapist he's a gang rape is he he organizes gang rapes in high school I mean the list goes on and on of the absurd\nAnd there was no accountability for those that smeared Brett Kavanaugh and accountability in my opinion comes on election day so I you know what ... if if they run Michelle Obama or whoever it is knock yourself out\nUm but I I Am I Am one of those is saying I Am I Am way too focused on\n'cause that's the only thing that's going to matters of mid term to this point\nBy the way the economy is not a so crazy after all the guys are I think it was a couple of months or a year ago up here in South Florida Miami Beach the guy or started selling a easy T shirts just 'cause his name was on it there was something for two hundred dollars I sold out like an an hour so I don't think uh this guy's crazy\n[laughter] I just I just love how

say what it is like tell me what his life was\nWell what he said we know from what we understand he acknowledged that knowledge of this that this poor guy was in danger when he went and then he comes in acts like well we don't know what happened that we're going to find out but we can't give up the the arms agreement that's for sure but we don't know and they had well not like at first\nI Would not dangerous\nFor the first of all first of all first of all he said he said and by the way today it was announced that he did talk directly to the uh the king\nOf Saudi Arabia denied it out now he said last night in this interview which was by the way record last Thursday and so at that point he said we don't know for sure what happened now it when you come at it is but it's now it's coming out that behind the scenes he has been putting pressure on Saudi Arabia and apparently apparently\nSaudi Arabia is beginning ready to announce the there was\nSome kind of a ... that he killed to show that didn't have to show he's been putting he's he's got a great job you know when you do in a negotiation you're a business guy like he has been\nSo successful you don't you don't you don't you don't you

I just\nI'm just saying I mean I you know you\n...\nKnow sometimes it doesn't get any more absurd than it gets when people make statements like that\nAt least I may ask you questions or questions were doing the research on that now by the way but I just want you to do this or that if you think if Donald Trump's father was a klansmen or Nazi you think it's just I'm asking this question you think that would have come out\nDuring the um during the campaign you think it would come out during the campaign and I'm just asking\nJust asking Mm yeah I think so yeah\nIf you find anything that shows that I'm wrong and that I'd be glad that I listen I've been wrong in my life before I'm not I'm not going to stand the ceremony so you know I've never I can be rough I'd never heard of that before making an accusation doesn't make it so lousy forward\nOkay Calvin just because you say something doesn't make it so I don't believe that that's the case and by the way you said that his parents were not born in this country once again is that uh\nOver this because you say so it doesn't make it so I don't believe that that's the case and by the way you said that his parents were not born in this country once again his dad was born in New York City mom in the u._k. just let you know\nOkay I didn't watch what you say it was pretty quick and checking say seven three three key eccentric seven three three nights say you're causing more coming up and just a few moments writer I K exit gee I'm Alan stuck\n\nAll across the country people coming together to speed up what we can learn about helps\nThe all of this research program is calling on one million people to join as we try to change the future of [noise]\nFuture generations\nVisit joins all of us\nAnd find out how you can become one [noise]\nThe all new radio dot com apple is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on you're listening to the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone now\nOr anywhere [noise]\n[noise] hey Sean Spicer and every mid term elections since the civil war the president's party has blocked an average of thirty two seats in the house of representatives and two in the Senate We're in for what will be a wild political season and there's going to be plenty to discuss and debate and dissect\nShe'll be sure to download my new podcast everything's going to be All right beginning in October ... election I was an hour long weekly political tide gas covering the very latest news across the country and will provide listeners with unique inside and you can't get anywhere else everything's going to be All right and subscribe and download today on radio dot com and I ...\nProbably okay to have one more drink before I drive home [noise]\nProbably okay I open the window to stay alert [noise] probably are kids of my mouth\nStep out of the car please [noise] I've probably made a mistake\nProbably okay isn't okay when it comes to drinking and driving if you see a warning sign stop and how like have a car or a friend that's driving is drunk driving and method ... by net send the ad council\nI'm voting in the mid term elections because my car because\nMy ancestors and to make it for my children are women before me fight we can remain free helping the community out term electrical every vote makes my opinion mattered vote I vote I vote in\nThe mid term election\nRegister now on I Am a voter dot com and don't forget to vote Tuesday November sex brought you buy I Am a voter an ad council\nAnd he goes on to say was mar I'm I'm saying Trump people independent people just normal people not here on the coast here stuff like that and they go you know what I don't know that much of a policy but you know this is just too fragile\nI Can't let these people in the oval lost because they're just too weak\nI didn't know that NPR did that you can't say homeless it's like people affected by homeless if you knew you know for like like let's be peace in the you know you don't want it on homeless people that'd be terrible that would be\nAny way I I salute um I I just flew Bill Maher her when they when they use and he tells the truth like\nThat and again he and I don't often agree but it's a wow I should this when the ... over came about because first\nThe only thing that I'm a ...
