Jordan who's written about it and we've got a right now the kicks in the limelight microwave so much for being with us\nHey Alan thank you for inviting me looking forward to our discussion\nWell I Want to know about this stuff because I don't know that much about a lecture an echo I ... I assume that they're basically the same but um I understand from what you've written about what I've heard from other people listen record him could even send a private conversation to some third party somewhere true or false\nYeah a in a in a nutshell yes it's true I mean in this new book of mind the end of life as we know it ominous news from the frontiers of science I\nTalk about this stuff but I in fact I deal with four sections ideal one section is with about the worldwide Web another one is about artificial intelligence slash robots\nAnother one has to do with surveillance technology and privacy and a fourth section has to do with genetic engineering this stuff with Alexa Alexei ... is the voice if you will as the genie inside of Amazon Echo and there are other kind of echo devices to these are what are we called voice activated assistance\nThat is to say you know they they sit in your home\nOr the echo for example it was it was the first it sits in your home\nAnd it's always listening and if you say elects a what's the temperature outside or Alexa order me a pizza or Alexa play music that I Love 'em then it it's what's called the wake word elect says awake wide awake syrup but she's listening in the background\nWhile waiting for seven you see\nAnd what happens is when you give Alexa command that that command goes to the cloud okay now the cloud and not somewhere up there it's it's a bank of huge computers are at various places around the country and that command gets recorded Alan and then\nAlexa formulates their response to that and then gives you the response that you you've asked for it now here's the thing those commands get recorded because the Lexus\nBecause those things are stored in the cloud they can be hacked or they can be sent to third parties as you've indicated this is very typical of what's going on right now\nI mean isn't that a case for me this sounds very very very creepy I'll be honest with you\nYeah yeah no I agree with you look I mean we have now gotten to the situation where\nWe are paying money I listen to this what we are paying money to bog our own home\nAll right and at the echo device is just the beginning hey do you own a smart TV\nSmart TV's come with little cameras and little microphones why because you get you can give voice commands now do your TV or in some cases you can use hand signals so they these TVs are always monitoring and we we learned and I talk about this and the book that the CIA\nOr some short while ago um they were hacked and it was revealed that the CIA uses the smart TV's the cameras and the microphones to spy on foreign agents but what's interesting Allen is the techniques that the CIA uses to you to turn these devices against us\nWe're actually originated with hackers out there just random hackers people in their living rooms or you know getting their kicks out of hacking these devices\nHey what about home security things where you put up cameras inside and outside to protect your home against intruders well it does that for you but then again hackers can turn those devices against you\nSo we are we're inviting this stuff into our own home Ellen and no I Do not own an echo I never would I Would never brings something like that into the house\nNow but I by the way I'm I'm with you I I just mentioned before you came on the air that uh I Know one of my daughters has one and I ... I was at their house couple weeks ago when my grand sons about two years of for not quite two and a half\nHe said you know make music music so I've tried to figure out how to do it I push the button I didn't realize my daughter told me after was on the news like Alexa and went out and I didn't know that I didn't know that sort I press the button that I thought would do it and sure enough\nI should play a Beatles music and sure enough it would play music and started playing it until we uh during the ... so I mean ah you know I I I'm I live in this whole idea is creeping real quickly mention something else you should my cameras on the light ring you know the ring or that you have when you\nRing and drinks and all those yeah\nBut they they they can actually hack into that stuff\nYeah because see see what you you you have to understand and I explained this in the book is that all of these devices were talking about whether it's the echo device or these home security devices and all I have a couple of other stories to tell you\nThat I'm this book is chock full of real life stories of things that are going on right now but um ah the these these things are all part of what it called the Internet of things I O T\nIn other words these are all devices that use the Internet in one way or another to work\nMonday is an example okay you talked about how did you just say you had a grandchild a two year old grandchild yeah the twins yeah I Want to grow you know okay you know how parents will buy these video monitors to make sure their kids are yeah OK\nWhen they're asleep and all that this is also an ... device this is an Internet a thing it works through the Internet because let's say the parent is at work and wants to check in with a child or travelling or whatever so it it sends a signal through the Internet\nWell I tell a story in the book again this is all true and it's all very technical it's not even a you know it's not even an extreme example of what's going on this is happening every day Alan I'm a hunter managed to use the dark Web and that's a whole nother thing that I talk about here but use the dark wet to hack\nDevices of a certain brand of video monitors and what they did then was to plaster all those videos feet now\nWet to hack devices of a certain brand of video monitors and what they did then was to plaster all those videos feet now imagine that the matching your two year old granddaughter asleep in her bedroom thinking that she's safe and sound in the house and\nSome hunker hopes that video monitor and plastered that video on the Internet this is what happened\nTo you know I didn't know that happens I mean can you is there a way to detect that are not\nOh yeah no the guy was caught the guy was caught and all you have to do is to go on the Web and you see this stuff was there\nBut I mean I mean how ... how would my my daughter and my son ... prevent something like that he wouldn't\nKnow they probably wouldn't this this is right a situation where they after I caught\nThis guy right yeah exactly that's why I say I did not write this book to scare people that's worthless what I did is I wrote this book to open people's eyes about what is going on right here and now I'm not talking about minus guy one day ...\nRight here right now so that they can protect themselves their children their their communities in the country and the world quite frankly\nI mean this ... amazing stuff make this stuff\nUp I'm Talking to Michael Jordan author of the end of life as we know I've only got about another minute or so I've got to ask you a quick\nAnd I wish we had a more discussion of this other issue also hey I or artificial intelligence or robots or is there a I mean it's a scary it's to scare tactic or is it possible that these types of devices could actually become a a super to human beings and and become a threat to us ever\nOh well they are already surpassing us there they're not eating the right chest that checkers at jeopardy I talk about this even in a Texas hold them poker now there's an artificial intelligence that program that was beat the pants off the chance so what we're seeing in fact\nAnd I discuss in the book and I know you need to wrap it up but just think of this there is a moment in time that is fast approaching that these scientists called the singularity\nAnd that singularity is the day we reach\nWhen super when computers AI becomes more intelligent generally not just certain games and stuff but generally surpasses our IQ so at the smartest human being has about ... and I have a hundred and twenty five they're talking about machines that have like use of a thousand two thousand five thousand\nThat day is called the singularity and they're predicting it's maybe ten twenty Thirty years or even sooner than that away so yes it's happening\nGood God I mean really I mean this does I mean this was yes it's freaky and and the idea of a you see what this election does right away gives you an idea of the direction we're headed in Michael Jones the author of the end of life as we know it's\nCheck it out so you are more a wise of what what can what what's going on and I guess we should talk at some future point also Michael gets a night but about uh how we can\nPrevent any of this stuff if at all possible to um from from from going that crazy is so we have\nThe lowly I wrote this book to empower people absolutely let's do it Allen thank you so very much\nThank you ... and I appreciate very much and you and I will for sure talk again Michael ... Michael Guillen joining us the author of the life of the end of life as we know at the end of life as we know check it out alright coming back tickets to\nPost modern jukebox is a throwback music

and\nWho don't have as much money growing up money and of course we'll take it away from those that have give it to the have nots he's saying it would be a dramatic change in our country to have low income people break out of generational poverty\nAnd uh this is the the peers to be the first high profile senator introduced legislation to create such a program Kamala Harris wanted this new cash assistance plant nothing compared to this at all\nAnd I'm Booker or his program Spartacus for Iran seems to focus on racial inequality in America and how to solve it\nSo um\nHe says that his own parents are in order to buy a home they're African American had actually pose as a white couple the purchase a house in a predominantly white neighborhood back in Nineteen sixty nine and that stuff he said shouldn't happen\nSo he wants to create these American opportunity accounts act\nAnd it would give this how it works is exactly how it works it would give each child born in the U.S a savings account with a thousand dollars see just born in the U.S bam you got a thousand bucks just for being born here at each year until the child turns Eighteen\nThe government would deposit as much as two thousand dollars into that account\nThe\nSize of the annual payments that they would deposit your account\nDepend on the child's family income lower income families would receive much larger checks a couch will be off limits until the child turns Eighteen\nAnd then they'd be able to use it for whatever they want a down payment on a house college tuition Booker has come up with a full list of eligible purchases yet but he but he's working on it right now\nSo it child who remains in the lowest income bracket of the program we get the most money well how much us good question that's a good question\nThe kids who are at the lowest and when they reached their Eighteenth birthday would have about ... a little over forty six thousand dollars\n\nTheir Eighteenth birthday child in the highest income bracket would have little over sixteen hundred dollars got it if you're in a low income bracket by the time you're Eighteen\nYou get over forty six thousand dollars if you're in the higher income bracket you'd get a little over sixteen hundred dollars\nRight and I'm On top of that\nHe also uh would uh he says the majority of the the money would I go to minority children\nThe average black child would accrue\nTwenty nine thousand dollars in their account\nAverage Latino child would get to twenty over twenty seven thousand average white child could end up with about half that about Fifteen sixteen thousand but again the the money's me accounts but still how much would they end up with after they're Eighteen\nWell again if you're in a lower income bracket\nThey give you a little over forty six thousand dollars\nHigher income bracket over sixteen hundred bucks so this will be skewed toward children who are of a lower income and are black or Latino\nHigher income bracket ... over sixteen hundred bucks so this will be skewed toward children who are of a lower income and are black or Latino not white or Asian\nJust certain types of uh uh ethnic or racial or folks not everybody necessarily and based upon your income as well this to me at least is based on the idea of complete\nFascist socialism slash communism\nI think it's incredible\nThat he is coming up with an idea that is right out of a it's a right out of Mark's right out of Carl Marx ...\nAnd the left or in the Democratic party or they are vying to see if can get further and further and further and further to the left\n\nRemembered Margaret Thatcher said she was a hundred percent right or center right socialism works great\nUntil you run out of the other guys money at that point you know you've got a real problem you don't think so take a look at Venezuela\nThey took the money away from the wealthy they gave it to the poor than they ran out of money and now they're going now what do we do they can't afford toilet paper they're killing pet rabbits and whatever they eat them they they know what to do anymore pretty sure the start eating the bark off the trees\nVenezuela\nAnd Cory Booker wants us to emulate Venezuela Cuba\nRed China um even\nThe Soviet Union that was so comedy all the way around him or had failed there and they had to go back now to a you know most of those countries are going capitalist\n\nIt doesn't work it only works until you run out of the other guys money got it and Cory Booker wants us to be in that in that camp\nIt's an stand that the people who are running the Democrat Party today unlike ... how it was on many of us were kids as a very different world now\n\nAnd people ought to be very very concerned and those people who are running here watch Jacky Rosen debate the other night Dean Heller and things she says right out of a playbook of left wing socialism and people should be very very very concerned\nYou may not think Heller is the greatest guy but remember he's not going to drive us into a socialist conundrum\nShe will\nSeven three three cats and two seven three three five nine six eight when they give you a chance to weigh in

I'm Glad you did where are you going to get this money and uh the money will actually come from um raising taxes on um\nOn people who are in the higher income brackets and also just got some other

and the reason she's part of a passionate campaign to prevent Michael rubber said from becoming lieutenant governor [noise]\nMhm that's coming up I Want to start with this though\nI was talking maybe ... ... and it's all over the CNN is using this in a very uh very twisted way\nDonald Trump or declared himself a nationalist oh my God\nAnd they are trying to equate the CNN editor at large Chris Cillizza or try to have quite that you not see is the more fascism big or you're a um [noise] and ah but\nJim Acosta from CNN set with Donald Trump really meant to say is that he's a white nationalist I mean this is what Jim Acosta now Jim Acosta you know is is a you know I talked to a short of a combination play you know that I mean it really is very very you know the guy is very sad\nBut the president was appearing at a rally and when he use this phrase\nAbout him being a nationalist and I want you to hear from his lips what he had to say and then I'll discuss this we'll get some calls as well as some three three kicks and do something to be three five months of say the president the Korean self a nationalist\nHappened and a lot of that guy Weprin first [noise]\nWe're taking care of ourselves version [noise]\nYes he is [noise] I Hope you are to three Nineteen cakes energy and a good afternoon great to have you with us on this er which usually after new [noise]\nAmerica [noise]\nYeah well listen the deal is is that his predecessor Brock Obama it was a global list and uh so we should do it for the whole planet that's that sounds nice it's feel good I get it I really do get it but the deal is is that um\nWe've got to be able to think about our country first and foremost as every country in this world thinks about themselves first and then becomes part of the global community but it should be for a position of strength and understanding what our true values are\nNow this person again that writes from CNN Chris Cillizza says patriotism doesn't include the idea promoting your values of culture is inherently superior to those of others\nWhich are the claim was that that's what the definition of Merriam Webster about nationalism means\nBut let me just be very clear our culture\nHere in the United states our values the way we do things is in fact superior to those of others I sent it and I mean it\nAnd if it wasn't superior to others you would not have people dying to get to this country how many people are on rafts to try to paddle to Cuba\nHow many people are running to try to become citizens of North Korea how many Americans left this country the United states and moved to Venezuela in the last few weeks why are those people are coming here\nI'll tell you why because our values and our culture is superior to those of others we have a sense of freedom and liberty and we walk the talk the other countries do not know there's more\nOn who writes for CNN Chris Cillizza says\nHistorical context or nationalism too close associations not seen as an and white nationalism the roots of eight of Hitler's rise were built around his emphasis on extreme nationalism drive out those across Europe who refused to acknowledge that superiority when I'm driving anyone out of this country\nWe and then as fake news I don't take questions from thank you ... you're you're absolutely right for not taking their collection I'll tell you what Jim Acosta said the president to this is why the President's Day questions from him\nUm we're not driving anyone out of his country\nPresident as a set anyone asked to leave because they're black white brown and yellow or any religion or any of this he never said that we're preventing people as far as possible from from invading this country they'll forge the mobs who want to come across our border uninvited the illegals yes we're trying to\nPrevent that without a doubt we have every right to defend our borders just like you have the right to defend your home for someone tried to invade your home\nThis is nuts Hitler's nationals and we're not putting people in camps nobody'd be as being tortured and killed and exterminated white nationalism the other like a a allusion that this is Chris Cillizza makes\nCaucasians are superior are inherently superior in order for society to truly prosper\nLike let's say let's not ... the president's talking about Americans black white yellow brown of our religious all ethnicities\n\nAnd what we're looking at is the president showing it sense of pride in this country this is nothing to do it is enough phobia or anything else\n\nThis person writes a CNN the big problem is that it's the history in context that comes with it no you should listen to what the president says instead of trying to overlay your interpretation\nAbout what it really means scouts guy well he is because the president today was asked by this disgusting CNN reporter Joe Acosta\nPresidents proud of our country to Acosta says Mr President the follow up on your comments and I'll be a nationalist there's a concern that you are sending coded language or a dog whistle does some Americans out there that what you really mean is that you're a white nationalist that's what this jerk Jim Acosta says the present the oval office\nPresence has never heard that never even heard that can't imagine that I never heard that theory about being a national as\nI Am very proud of our country cannot continue to allow it's happened to our country to continue happening we can't let it happen so I'm proud\nI'm proud of our country I Am a national is it's a word that hasn't been used too much some people use it but I'm very proud I think you should be brought back\nAll I Want he said his for our country to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of ours so called allies they're not treated our country fairly so in that sense I Am absolutely a national is and\nI'm proud of it seven three three kicks at the seven three three five nights excite give me a ... can break the president is proud of his country's a nationalist I'm telling you I stand with the president as being a nationalist I\nHonor this country first and foremost I honor respect other nations the world and other people and other cultures\nBut let me tell you something without any do apology with no do apology our culture our values are superior to those of others if you don't think so I find that other country they think is equal or better try it there for a while\nYou've been fantastic thank you Mr President I think you have two seven three

with me right now state senator Patricia Farley\nAnd I first of all thank you very much for coming in thinks they made me not state senator Farley was a Republican and then became a I'm\nAn independent [noise] and you may say well why don't you do that because I've had some people say well I think is more liberal than you were thinking and I'd have you been I've known for some time and the positions you held back when you were elected\nAs a Republican state senator you hold the same positions today you're changing your positions or the educational savings account you know the essays are school choice and some of the other more conservative issues and my ... my ... wrong and that are well\nNow you're absolutely correct I never changed ... ... who I profess to be publicly that wasn't the impetus behind me changing my radio station\nJust and and and if somebody else gets because I Want to get more into the U.S has been some discussion why did you change your registration\nAnd it can be plain and simple and the party leadership the Senate cock his leadership I'm at the time I was elected and we went up to the two thousand to teen legislature and I just morally ethically you know actually disagreed with\nOkay and when you say the party leadership be referring really to one person is big center Michael Roberson yes that's correct All right now you are also working with the um with an organization right now to keep Roberson from be coming as a state senator right now he's running for lieutenant governor\nAnd you're trying to do and I have no idea where you are right on the governor's race or Senate race or any of the other raised you\nOr and you're trying to and I have no idea where you're out on the governor's race or Senate race or any other race you are we've never talked about that but in terms of the lieutenant governor's race you want to make sure that he does become governor why\nBecause I think he is his career in politics has been the definition of what America doesn't like about politics um\nIt it's shocking but he is the ... in in our state I Believe the ultimate example of what's wrong with politics and politicians um it's definitely scams it's I'm saying whatever it is to get elected\nA lot of blacks are running as Republicans features like running as the Democrat and no matter which one you choose to vote for a vote for ... for governor Republican I still encouraged not to vote for I'm Michael represent as lieutenant governor even though he's the Republican\nMost of my most most mostly vote Republican straight down most of it but we try to govern I certainly will not a vote that way because I think that he doesn't deserve to be in there and um if\nHe did win and if I had a ... and the God Forbid happen to Adam than like a rubber she'll be our governor and that was at the state would go to hell out of hand\nReal quick I Want to give you a chance to respond and I want to give them some of these issues also with\nThe uh when you went to him after you've already been asleep sent over two years and you would take a responsibility of who you're Tunisia's I Believe yes and a dog you you're forced to choose your own so you shouldn't bother you got responsible for\nTheir business of like the ones you just resigned from the state Senate and you know let somebody else to go over well\nSo I think that's the problem we have in government is that we don't create opportunities for women to participate a and I do think a single mom I'm moms women in the legislature is a benefit to our state\nAnd to to be very Frank at the beginning of this in my situation was it a secret to anybody um and before I said yes and before we went forward we talked about how this would work\nSo well before you even rarely yeah the first\nTo absolutely so it was um I mean it was explained to me how the city or that I'm Sorry that committee assignments would set 'em\nWhich committees heard what bills I like the commitment and I was told the last two weeks before a deadline pleased plan that it's going to be a rough for you to make the schedule with your kids have a babysitter have a nanny these are and so it worked it worked in two thousand Fifteen\n... on it would have worked in two thousand and Seventeen what didn't work with putting me an evening committees that started at three o'clock here hundreds of bills and so the majority of the time I could expect not to be home to ten o'clock at night\nYou the first two years you were there much room she was working\nWith you and ... allowed for an adjustment to the schedules to accommodate your life and your demands and then something changed what changed\nSo during the two thousand Fifteen session 'em and they're after\nIt was to me it was uncomfortable to have bills that we just put our name on 'cause it looked like good mailers and um we lie to the taxi cab people about where um I mean there was just nothing honest going on in that room and I understand politics and there's you know\n... um I don't think I understood it as much as um what actually happens there but when people are walking into your office going you guys are if you're lying this and that you you went out he make campaign promises you\nYou pledged you weren't going to do something and now all of a sudden you're switching and the reality for everybody else in the caucus is we're all watching I mean we found out when he told the press what was going on we had no idea we didn't know what was going on there was any cock is meetings it was like meetings were lunch we just get a couple of\nOther members and have lunch and\nIt was it was literally crazy um\nAnd it was um\n[noise] it was gut wrenching to participate and I'm not somebody who is looking to run for office um for higher office for um notoriety or anything like that um I just want to do my job and I wanted to go home\nYou don't run for reelection rather know so I mean your term to turned out you're you're you're at the end of your ah your term and a November's the election coming up two weeks and then the end of December you're the lawyers which yes\nSo I I didn't believe it and I'm On November sex and the the new person is as\nWell I don't know yeah so there are elected there will automatically yeah luxuries of ever sex jokes\nAnd then they're sworn in in in February\nAnd February ... for a second because I figure you so you know what's interesting I'm Talking with us there is a reporter for with is I I I Know of is how we treat women and when you say about\nHim having a very um a shovel ego in a very ... I mean I found out when I spoke before the Republican ... I didn't speak ... are actually was two years ago\nShallow ego in a very thin skin I mean I found out when I spoke before the southern his Republican ...
