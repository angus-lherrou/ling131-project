game Murray Rush Holt let's so CBS Sports radio ... it is friday that the king of ... well today's Thursday Allen I Know you skip a day and it gets ones that are name on the streets want to hear it\nKicks anti uh let me get into this uh the uh there are various thoughts about what's going on with these with these bombs are in these packages being sent to an all these folks\nAnd of course as I mentioned uh one of the theories just come up from Lou Dobbs which is what's called a false flag operation a crime committed by one party that's disguised to give the impression was committed by another group\nAnd rush leaving his gesture the culprit was a Democrat operative ending to portray Republicans are the worst possible light in the mid term elections the left\nWing media drive by a mid mid stream me medium with these folks are saying that these kinds of ideas are insane and I'm a uh it's actually a insane and um\nThat they should not be making these kinds of ah fought such a at all or ... at all\nIn the meantime in the meantime or what we have is no proof that it's coming from anyone on the right either and the fact\nGoing out to people who\nUm ... as they is they put it in in the media they're putting it out saying anyone who disagrees with Trump or has been the target of a of of critics of Trump all these the critics of Trump we're getting these all that\nThey want to totally this regard the fact that this could be a ploy now let me tell you\nA these folks that the only ones Lou Dobbs and Rush Limbaugh James Woods or has also put this out suggesting that these are the so called bombs are obvious political stunts\nHe brushed off of the incident as an obvious political stunt he tweeted I'm putting words out who gives a rat's ass about the Clintons enough to do this obvious political stunt end of quote and he was of course criticized for some of this is well\nI'm ... and I get that nobody wants to be able to think that any one of their side would do anything like this at all let me just say and and it's very curious that's the same as very curious that what we had\nWas a situation where\nDemocrats or Republicans both find to be able to catch the attention of voters and the upcoming election just a few days away\nEarly voting in a lot of states including ours and what do uh what's the narrative that both sides want to be able to portray Democrats were trying to capture the idea of of healthcare being the most the biggest concern for everyone it's health care of the biggest concern about everyone at all\nBut you can't beat that they were saying\nAnd then this mob caravans started coming up from Central America started I was just a few hundred people\nCross the border in um uh in in in Mexico with about four thousand people another several thousand were added to that now some reports are actually saying that could be up to be ready for this fourteen thousand I I'm not sure that's an accurate\nCount or not and again different people giving different numbers but we know there are several thousand people in this mock caravan heading toward the southern border of the United states and planning to confront the or the American government\nTo try to ... a strong arm their weight in to this country\nAnd people have been paying attention to that now for a couple of weeks it's been the main story it's been the headline and the narrative ... what's going on in the news has been these folks trying to cross the border\nOr wanting to come up here to cross the border coming through Mexico the caravan lawn care of and the suffering that's going on\nAnd that's been the narrative that people have been paying attention to that's captured the imagination of great great portion of the American public if not most number one number two\nThe numbers in all of the race is just about all the races nationally\nAnd the Senate governorships and I have now begun to shift toward Republicans and you can say whether or not you believe polls the only poll that we should really believe and I I I get it is on election night\nBut nonetheless the polls that had been showing either some racist lean toward Democrats or being even Steven are now beginning to shift in go towards the Republican or conservative side and a lot of this I Believe had to do with\nThe narrative being shifted toward these immigrants these these\nAnd a lot of this I Believe had to do with them there to being shifted toward these immigrants these these these migrants these caravan mobs ... you know trying to come to the United states and the president say we're not going to allow them in the president's standing for him saying I\nTold you were going to seal the border I told you and then now sending troops to the to the border\nWe're not going to let them in and we're going to be able to we're going to cut off funds for some of these Central American countries that have allowed people to come forward without trying to retrieve them\nAnd then it takes something the people in this country or have bought and understand the president's\nHis narrative on this and as a result the focus has been on how successful the president has been to keep his word to make sure that we don't have an invasion\nHow do you get off that narrative that positive direction for Republicans you create some kind of a distraction could that have happened here\n'cause my back and talk about talk about what's going on connected with these bombs as well much more to talk about and your calls as well seven three three cats anti seven three three

I've got my ideas but I Want to hear from your perspective do you think this is working out the best that we could do for homeless here\nI think it's an important first step for us so the court got homeless resource center is part of the city's broader strategy to address homelessness and it is just a first step so their other elements to the strategy that we're working on for example more permanent supportive housing\nBut the courtyard homeless resource center is important because a lot of homeless people actually don't know how to get connected to services and navigate the service system to kind of in that ongoing cycle of despair that they are and\nWould agree with you on that I Would absolutely agree with you and um I and I think there are good intentions behind this ... year I'll be honest I really do and I'm Glad it's only a first step because I think the other things that can be done to broaden this um\nLet me let me start out with this way first of all\nI've had calls from people who are were former\nBusiness people in the downtown Las Vegas area former\nBecause they say they're too many homeless too many problems down there are people wandering around drugs and ... and the like and I've actually had calls from people on the air here unsolicited who said to me that they have elected to close their business up downtown\nAnd they moved to green valley the district and and elsewhere\nAn solicitor who said to me that they have elected to close their business up downtown and moved to green valley the district and an elsewhere because it's safer it's a it's more secure\nLess problems and um they're even paying more ... but they're they want to get out of the downtown area\nThat is a concern when you consider that the people down there who are doing business are making money and then they're paying taxes to the city and if they leave the city those tax dollars go way too\nMy biggest concern is about the\nA negative impact that the homeless a court or is having on business in general in in that particular area a lot of people again uh businesses packing up and leaving as a result of it\nYears ago and I that's what I'm trying to what your your thoughts on this because I think there is a solution above beyond this this particular facility that you've opened up\nIt was again the first step as you said ... years ago when a mayor Oscar Goodman was mayor the twelve years he was on my show one morning and he made a recommendation\nThese homeless folks are transported to the former with women's prison in gene\nOkay not believe in prison it's the former ... women's prison and rehabilitated and have them go there to be able to access all the services there that they would need on a twenty four seven basis and at the same time be able to get transportation from this facility and Jean\nThey needed to back to Las Vegas for appointments and whatever what would they do with gene in this former former president that there was they would um they would be rehabilitated they would be a help with ah the resumes if they had problems with addictions\nThey would be would be addressed there if they had problems with the mental health issues that could be addressed there\nAre ... and the point of it was to be able to allow the area which is now for a master in Las Vegas boulevard area to be able to thrive as a\n... is is an ongoing business area bring more businesses in an attractive people down there and make that rehabilitated like they've done to ease Fremont and some of the other areas\nWill I mean the the bears on my show saying this one day and the next day of course what is the newspaper say they say mayor was the homeless the president of course was not the case in the least bit but that's the attitude they took\nThe reason I bring this up is because I see that concept as a longer term solution a lot of homeless people are going to come here and people will have\nA drug and alcohol problems people with mental health issues and to\nHave them service in mass in the downtown area I don't think it's going to be anything that is going to necessarily entice people to want to open a business that I wouldn't I mean I don't know if you I probably wouldn't either\nThis is one idea that ... that we have that is more longer term as a solution your thoughts on that\nSo the real long term solution to homelessness is housing you went to end homelessness you house people\nAnd so part of our strategy is looking at ways to increase the Affordable housing in really workforce housing so not just for homeless individuals but for the guy that works at the dry cleaner and the gal that walk your dog and the teacher's aide in your kids' classroom\nAll of our community needs more affordable housing and so are longer term strategy really is to look at how do we build and maintain housing that folks can afford many of our homeless gas at the courtyard actually work\nAnd they're working at minimum wage jobs and asked pressure on the housing market increases and rents get more expensive it pushes people\nOut of rental housing the\nOr hope where the court yard is located has a lot of investment already in service infrastructure so all of what we called the big boys that are Catholic charities the rescue mission the shade tree in that area in that neighborhood in in that area\nAnd so that that infrastructure that a public investment that the community has made in serving all kinds of um indigent individuals'\nIs right there so the city acquired the vacant parcels that were in that area and you write businesses probably weren't going to locate right across the street from the men's homeless shelter\nSo it is actually an ideal place to serve individuals who for whatever reason having not use the traditional shelters services are truly a minute\nIndividuals who for whatever reason having not use the traditional shelters services are truly a memo to address homelessness is to get people house we are doing workforce development so they can work on their resumes we actually have\nEmployers who come to the courtyard and do hiring events they hire homeless people on the spot smelly dirty all of their teeth missing but they're willing to work and if employers who um\nHave sort of high turnover if you will in their workforce are willing to give the guess at the courtyard a second chance many of them can resolve their homelessness by themselves that's what they tell us homeless people say I don't need a sandwich I Need a job\nAnd so we're working with local employers to help them get employed we work with them to identify rent that they can afford so they can make that transition they want a self resolved they actually don't want the public handout\nAnd so we're working with them in the areas that they have identified as area is important to them they want to reconnect with their families they want to get jobs many of them don't even have an ID they can't prove they are who they say they are and once we work with him on those kinds of issues\nThey can start that process to getting back to self sufficiency\nI I don't disagree with you about the Ford oval housing for people who are working are but I'm the people who have mental health issues\nUm it was beyond affordable housing I mean they have got to be treated and help for the the problems that they're going through and um and on an ongoing regular basis I mean like twenty four seven I was back in the\nEighties or seventies I forget which the courts decided to uh\nUh not have people house who were a mental problems people at the time way Ronald Reagan was not him it was the was the courts who made that decision and the result of that was that a lot of people end up in the streets like they are now and I you know I'm\nThinking that it is time that we revisited that to get some of these people off the streets\nNot putting them in in in a penitentiary or any kind of a forest housing but in an area for with no health problems that you put them in an\nAn in House Situation where they can be treated and people who have problems with drugs and alcohol\nWe've got to be treated with that also and job they're able to overcome it instead of having them on the street trying to get the next drink or the next six or whatever it happens to be so I mean ... when it comes to people who are working I think that the Ford will housing issue is relevance\nYou know because they're working the they're they're not\nHaving mental problems they're not having drug and alcohol problems it's strictly financial and I I Know we've got to try to find areas for for the housing perhaps\nIt's the the areas where you're you're working an ounce homes court or could be used as some of these affordable housing areas while the other folks are transported to another place to be able to be helped out\n[noise] so you hit the nail right on the head the legal system's ... across the United states that\nRequire communities to not institutionalize folks who are having whatever kinds of issues substance use issues and mental health issues and they have a lot of choice just as you you are I Would have choice about where we go and where we live\nSo the initiative with the ...\nWere I Would have choices about where we go in where we live so the initiative with the quite yard is about food choice low barrier meaning I'm not going to require you to get rid of your pet I'm not going to require you to\nBlow into a breathalyzer I'm not going to require you to get rid of all your personal belongings we lowered those barriers he don't have an excuse to not come in and access services\nBut then you get to choose which services you need to address your particular situation and so we aren't requiring anyone to do anything we're rounding 'em up and forcing them into the courtyard or or any other facility because\nYou are absolutely right the courts have stated that each of us as individuals have some constitutional right to choose\nWe do but my my thought is that some of these folks who have mental issues\nWith all candor and with all common sense on us they don't have the wherewithal to make the choices that would be best for them I Know you might say well we all make bad choices but some of these folks are impaired to the point\nThey really cannot make the choice you know you make a bad choice here and there are these folks may be impaired where they cannot ever make a choice that's going to work in their favor and I'm thinking about it on behalf of them I'm not trying to take their rights were trying to give them\nA sense of being able to get in balance so they can make choices that are best for them what you think about that one too quick break come back and kids you know just the one with Kelly Thomas gives a Las Vegas community services director seven three three ... three three five nights ... I'm Alan stock and this is new stocky forty AM ... ex ante\nMore explosive devices continue to be found are sent a vocal critics of the president law enforcement closer to pinpointing who sent them in from where I'm not into the world series what if you got free tacos Michael cast and we'll talk about starting a six tomorrow morning under that is one of the [noise]\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nAnd so we we're looking at how do we ensure that we\nAre managed toiling in hand washing and we discourage people from driving down they're throwing bologna sandwiches out of the back of their ... you know someone could get sick if you're on the street and you get diarrhea what happens to that ... I hate to be so graphic\nAnd I don't know that you're like no you're you're actually from us I Know you've got to say like ... is you cannot sugarcoat the problem otherwise\nFolks are not going to understand the seriousness of it you know everything's nice and sweet and great or the what's the problem as much as we can drag and people are dying and or an ... and in places like LA and places like San Diego and could certainly happen if they're there I'm sure they're dying here too from\nFrom malnutrition and other things too so I mean we we should be addressing these issues one of the things you you I'm a ... and I I Do respect or you're doing in terms of the health issue as well one of the issues I Know you've addressed as being affordable housing yes I'm\nA you know and again in the area that you said he was courtyard off I get that we could have affordable housing and some of those areas warnings you you've talked about virtually is about a Ford will housing a multi family buildings in single family subdivisions\nUm\nWhat do you mean by single family subdivisions I mean I I Know where I live in a lot of people who live in the ... they're nicer areas and the big again I'm not going to go to I don't want like affordable housing or section eight housing if you will you know in my community called me and then be the answer is yes I Am\nOkay I Will call you and then being ... [laughter] so here here's the clarification that I always want to be sure the public sees when I'm Talking about affordable housing I'm Talking about housing that the regular working class Joe can't afford to live in\nSometimes that might be permanent supportive housing like the individuals who have mental health that we were talking about many of them need to be house and they're going to need wraparound services\nSo they can stay stable a house out of ... that's not most of the four double housing in fact most of the Affordable housing that I'm the city supports\nAh as for our senior population we have support it\nTo the fore double housing in fact most of the Affordable housing that I'm the city supports a is for our senior population we have supported housing for\nA transitional age youth so young adults coming out of the foster care system so that they don't end up in homelessness or the criminal justice system\nAnd so when I'm Talking about affordable housing I mean across the board we've got college students we've got senior citizens we've got the ... at your local coffee house like these are folks the person who cuts your air\nOr many of those businesses that say they're going to pack up and move because they don't like homeless are around them may actually have employees that they're paying ten or twelve bucks an hour you\nHave to make Eighteen dollars an hour to afford a two bedroom apartment in southern Nevada so what happens when you're not making that you maybe double up with friends or maybe you for ... cetera\nTo fight a creative solution to it and we should act like almost across the board or it is I don't agree that it's almost as across the war because again you've differentiate between\nPeople who have mental health problems from the person who's working both ... I mean there there's a big difference there and there's a difference also the people who were almost because of drug and alcohol problems with the similar type of\nAttention that the folks with mental health problems of\nSo if we suggest that there's an opportunity to put affordable housing all across the valley the that means that the preschool teacher can live in your neighborhood it it means that the a barber can live in your neighborhood it means a whole host of\nA folks in different income brackets but just regular Joes regular James what happens when those regular Joes and regular Jane's cannot afford their housing they end up at the court yard\nThey end up homeless they actually end up needing more social service supports once they start that downward spiral he'll give you an example and we paid house for about twenty two thousand dollars a year\nWe could how someone in affordable housing but if they start that downward spiral um and now they're sick they're in and out of the hospitals they're going to probably have some vague currency a kind of criminal justice things now they're in and out of the local jail Seventy three thousand dollars a year\nSo the investment as a community that we could make in having more affordable housing is the difference between twenty two thousand dollars or Seventy three thousand dollars a year you're going to pay for it so you pay for it on the front end it can pay for it on the back in but as a community we're all going to be impacted by this issue\nAnd let me say this to to build affordable housing in certain parts of our community is not um financially reasonable because a lamp costs a in a certain various summer Lynn as a ... ... ... we're not as an area\nRight across from several in very different though they are in certain parts of the downtown Las Vegas area perhaps through the court or something you know some of those areas so to be able to buy\nOr get land in several it and then build of core to vote for the housing a would be very affordable I mean it would be a very expensive venture to be able to create so I Would say that we would look more toward areas that do exist where the land is less expensive\nAnd we would be able to build some of this before the housing in those areas and it would be more concentrated in the downtown area I think about that I Know your IX of out there\nBe able to build some of this affordable housing\nIn those areas and it would be more concentrated in in the downtown area\nThe thing about I Know we got the brakes went back and want you to respond okay All
