wrangler jeans\nWell all joking aside about the capital of the world and that sort of thing the idea that a major American city should have this problem with\nThe season the needles and all these sorts of things as they are attracting are trying to attract I should say visitors from all over the world is is really an appalling stayed at this point and people in the bay area and particularly in San Francisco\nI'm even while they are liberal or they draw the line at a certain point and we're seeing more and more people in the bay area and speaking out about this\nUh you know I I read the article you referred me to from New York Times and it starts out the heroin needles pile of extra between park car's\nYellow soup who's out of a large plastic bag by the curb and I'm like oh my God nobody has to be attracted to want to visit San Francisco which by the way we had our honeymoon there many years ago and it was a one time an absolutely fantastic city I have to say a beautiful city look back to the movies\nOf uh Clint Eastwood's early movies\nAbout dirty here in San Francisco and then San Francisco was a great place\nIn one time and I'm just amazed that they're saying is single span of hide street\nHost an open air narcotics market by day and night occupy and I've seen pictures of people actually\nThe people who put bleach combined the people are are zoned out on the street they've been shooting up in their needles are right there and everything\nWell it's even worse than that um that you're being kind a there are people that will ultimately shoot up on the street with passers by coming and going and and this includes young people children and because the city and county in San Francisco has had this\nA lousy faire attitude about what people do in the city it has contributed to what is really really unseemly a look to the city of San Francisco at this point in certain neighborhoods\nYou right there as a south of marketing the tender line and primarily those those are the two blocks on Brian Sobel mayor your TV political commentator\nA and they're saying that all this is going on just a Fifteen minute walk away from the offices of Twitter and ... which happened to be big huge you know businesses and you have to it's going on right there\nWell absolutely and I think again it's a very progressive city and so people\nAre many residents of San Francisco feel sorry for some of these people who are in harm's way frankly on the street and\nUm don't have a problem with their city governments city and county government uh putting money towards folks and for a long time put up with a lot of this but it's it's an epidemic at this point it's gotten worse and worse and the political folks in San Francisco have not been able to solve it\nA personnel and that sort of thing are on the front lines with this and I'm sure at times they feel very unsupported and it's just a very difficult situation\nListen I'm not a liberal I'm Out of progressive okay but I Do have a lot of a feeling for these people as well um but as you said and people are walking by the streets or listen to me the public health department is the figure you've gotten the same article public health department in August alone two months ago\nRetrieved almost a hundred and sixty five thousand needles on the street and you know we're talking about a dozen or to a hundred and sixty five thousand of them\nWere worse than that Alan I'm if you're walking in some of those areas and this isn't like an Easter egg hunt where you've got to look under a Bush to find the egg or you can find needles sitting around on the sidewalk next the buildings along with the urine stain or even worse and\nForget that it's just a bad image for San Francisco it is a health hazard that needs to be dealt with\nThe say if you're gonna take a walk around those areas wrap your shoes and plastic bags um you know Gavin Newsom former mayor of San Francisco and now a and they say leading candidate for governor of the state of California I'm sad and and you saw this quote the city I reached the point of enough is enough\nHe says quote you can be to permissive and I think ah I happen to think we have cross the threshold is said\nAnd not just in the city you see it's just grateful but meanwhile would he was mayor he didn't do a damn thing to be able to mitigate this problem\nWell that's the whole thing is there's been a whole string of responsible parties here in an office and an all emanates from an inability to just say no are really not to quote Nancy Reagan but the idea of allowing this and then supporting it with public money [noise]\nUh and and I hear what they say you know if if we don't put money into it if we don't provide places for these people to to shoot up and clean and clean environments and that sort of thing they're just going to do it out on the street well guess what they're doing it out on the street now a lot of these people don't end up going to places\nThat want to help them because they just ... their addiction is so much or whatever they just don't go to places that have any rules\nAnd they say that they're they're allowing us in these areas so don't spread elsewhere then they they they are they allow certain parameters so it's not going to go out to other it's like a containment zone they're calling it a this is a this is to say the new mayor by the way in London Breed a said that she's going to provide an additional one thousand best for the homeless\nOver the next two years but they say there are like almost five thousand homeless in San Francisco so a thousand beds\nAre not going to do a whole lot I mean they need a radical radical intervention or in San Francisco to take care of this\nUh otherwise it's going to bleed on over to the north bay South Bay and that is me as well\nWell I think to some extent it already is um you have a homeless encampments in Oakland as an example that are the size of a small villages\nYou know a whole city block or maybe not that long but a couple of hundred feet of tense as an example just plop down in a certain area of violence by the way is associated with these encampments as one\nPerson or another sometimes with psychiatric issues are attacking people it it's it's just not a good environment and somehow some way\nOr the city and county of San Francisco but not just the city and county of San Francisco but all these cities where this problem exists\nI have to come up with a solution and began tackling this problem\nAbsolutely and like I said I I think San Francisco one time was a beautiful city I really it was a we were there for a honeymoon many years ago was very romantic and um you know you see no pictures besides Clint Eastwood\n... was a great city and I know my politics were different than the people in San Francisco but I Hope that they get their stuff together because in\nAs always happens in large cities the areas that you referred to a for example the tender line has been a problem area for years and years and you can go to some other areas and the city where\nFrankly people are wealthier enjoy better\nA social services and that sort of thing and you don't have the same problem but you go to a market street south of market the tender line a lot of your listeners will have a traveled to San Francisco no these areas um it becomes very problematic you don't feel safe walking down the street\nI'm for crime for these health issues and everything else and it's incumbent upon the politicians in San Francisco to begin tackling this problem and not kicking the can down the road which is exactly what I'm a soon to be governor ... did he had an opportunity and he didn't solve the problem either\nA you know I I certainly hope they do Brian so Barry TV and political commentator thank you my friend for being with us I said well we appreciate it and are you talking again very soon absolutely take her out and have a great ...

Meyer whenever she's another idiots she also follows up with the same thing she asked\n[laughter] restaurant or African [laughter] Chris Rock night\nOr maybe look better to do that All right maybe it'll work there really I don't know\nWhere in the black community unless and black folks are about to train Kanye West and the racial draft okay they've had it with him he's not\nThat well well I Do I Do know that reference I Know that that is an old Dave Chappelle skit I Know that All right good luck on [laughter]\n\nSeriously I mean this is not the kind of two thousand you know for this in the college dropout album guy yeah I'm\n... this is not and what's funny to me is to watch all of these white people behind Donald Trump\nClapping away at the name of Kanye West when he was the last that long ago that Kanye West said that George W. Bush doesn't like black people care Hurricane Katrina and you know ... so the ... but now all of a sudden ... because he put on a mat hats and he's an attention for like the president\nHe's all of a sudden now that the the model spokes person he is he's the token negro of the of the Trump Administration this is ridiculous and no one should be taking Kanye West seriously\nAll right we don't say you seriously and we don't see CNN seriously and obviously um CNN is it's not it's not fake news is racist\nA chatter is what it is football legend turns activists were Walker now calling for CNN to fire Don Lemon after he was laughing at this you've heard of uh how we laughed a few moments ago when the car sellers uh uh made the statement ah\n[noise]\nThe the the issue is ... Walker or by the way it just like you know to keep things straight it was openly supported Trump\nIs also advocated for mental health issues which by the way you didn't hear it but they literally they mock mental health or in this segment as well\nAnd a Walker says um he's tweeted he went to bed appalled over done lemons despicable behavior laughing of terrorists at my ... awful remarks about Kanye West visit with Trump woke up wondering why CNN doesn't take all three off the air\nOkay um anyway set Meyer fired back at him\nSaid bless your heart you want to science me because I expressed a different opinion than yours because I called out kind there for what he is uninformed\nAnd then walk or comes back and says no tear something ... anyone that is African American was an opinion different than yours you want them to call them out by using the N. word and Don Lemon is laughing to me that's bullying and shameful\nSo and by the way walking out the only one that took a of the fence to that\nFox has contributed a drawing Murdoch said this these reprehensible racist comments on CNN are typical of the Trump hating left that exist in the mainstream media and it goes on to say black Americans are the first cells are mocked integrated with words we last saw under Jim Crow\nIf President Trump had no black supporters they would call his circle what\nLily white but he's trivialize now as a token and doesn't read\nTurning points USA's the Kansas oh it was on Fox last night I saw it\nAnd she said the segment was not only racist was absolutely despicable saying I cannot believe it would be allowed on any network least of all a hostess laughing as if it's funny so you know listen I people can actually say what they want to say and I am for freedom of speech but you know what\nThey were ... I I Believe they were shooting racist or behavior I Believe they absolutely were\nAnd uh I used to call him out\nBecause of the color of skin which is exactly what they did is in fact racist let's just to be honest about it\nSo that's what he was yeah that was lemon and sour pushing women had laughing or Judy your tax anti welcome to the show\nMy head and someone who marched with Dr killed someone who doesn't look at color and look at content that character that people I guess that ... they are racist\nThan the other day and every one of them should be removed from the air anybody who has a poignant and then and now I hate I hate or they're black\nWhite Christian party any group of eight\nI Am appalled that Dr King alive today and by the way he went down the voting Republican ... king would be a kid that how dare you\nYou know the the president has actually a a creative today in Congress or Seville may believe are the lowest unemployment rate for blacks in history\nAnd instead of being a appreciative grateful thankful and and and and supporting him instead they're saying we've got to impeach him we've got impeached Kavanaugh we've got to ... we have to go back to dependent being dependent on the government for everything some ... and\nIt's sad that party I think\nThe party of hate absolutely and you're right about King I mean I absolutely I uh I I support it with Dr King did the fact that that he that he marched with suit and tie on and took the abuse he did in order to be able to sit down at a lunch counter to be able to vote on an equal basis to be able to uh\nAnd you use the bathroom that everyone used I mean the man really had a lot of greatness and him and the people today on an appreciative\nUh but they are filled with hate they ought to be ashamed and believe me a a king of probably turn it over in his grave with Roche fear of saying that I'm sure he has Judi I appreciate your call thank you very much for your call this afternoon is despicable\nIt is absolutely despicable despicable and and I am saying that\nI don't know if less leftist are ashamed by this or not 'cause I don't know if they have shame I don't know if they ... I don't know and he's an attention more like the president yes he's an attention whore like the president\nWill thank you very much for those are very delicate words there are ... you're a real babe

my show before a he said that it's not such a crazy idea because people like to come to Las Vegas\nWhere it's true people to come to Las Vegas but\nAre they really going to level the real now I and the real may have to re go ... go through some you know some fixing up and I understand from some people have been there lately that it was a\nParts of it are kind of darkness and stuff like that I don't I haven't been there in a while they've got this uh they've got a great ride the Indian restaurant there's fantastic love of the food fantastic um and and you've got Penn and teller they are doing great over there\nI I I I just can't imagine that they would rip the entire Rio down to put up\nIn major league baseball stadium that's\nMy first one I Can't imagine bringing major league baseball team to Las Vegas I just can't imagine that\nHow many how home games they have we talking about this yesterday eighty some odd that right roughly about or you don't know I think it's about eighty ... something like that high seventies or eighties and they and they all they last for quite a long time people can't go into the casinos and and everything\nI I Would um I I Would think the chances are we're not going to have a major league baseball team here and I don't care I I ... we want to see one\nI'll be honest with you we've got we're having a or a football team come here which just got what eight home game seven or eight or something like that you know and then that's\nWhen they still got a bill bats fear thing that that other sphere ... jumbo\nGet behind a no global thing that's behind the Venetian let's get snow globe you shake it up and it snows all of a yeah that is supposed to be um\nThat is supposed to be for a concert it's only ... know sporting events they said just just concerts big round and water and all the other places in the air for then ah concerts\nRight and other and other yeah it's just and we asked him to many things man\nToo many places\nI Can't imagine that we would actually have a a first of all I Can't imagine we're gonna have a baseball team here I cannot imagine that\nNo one knew what they do in Oakland and just you know put the baseball team in [laughter] in there a new stadium you could do that I mean theoretically you could do that and then there'll be like man this is what we went through is why we left\n[noise] alright critic from Steve and Steve you're on K Cindy welcome to the show\nHim and took the only time how are you All right welcome sir\nCouple of points Alan ... sounded like she was nice but a little bit of not informed definition and Webster's Dictionary of negro was one of the major races mankind including the indigenous people of Africa and also about a river in South America has nothing to do with what she said\nWell yeah I mean there are different races or the caucus site is one in the right is another and and the ... another you know we all learned that in small yeah as far\nAs being someone who is not the some of the family the term sheet it has nothing to do with that I had a point of that can make quickly who wants to sit and watch baseball in the middle of July when it's a hundred and Seventy degrees nobody I Know\nTo tell you that we're talking about that today they would have to ...\nA an enclosed stadiums they couldn't have a retractable ... but it has to be totally totally enclosed so if you want to sit and watch baseball in an enclosed stadiums yeah I'm not so sure I'm not so sure about as close with their condition and\nTo really because [laughter] that'd be cool yeah I don't know anybody that's going to be that nuts don't want to watch baseball in the summer in this town most baseball season starts in what late march and goes into what September right\nYeah well we're ... got it right now the Dodgers play a tomorrow night at a on our sister station what five o'clock or five thirty or something like that so yeah like tomorrow yet but\nI don't think it's going to become reality how 'bout you\n[laughter] I I don't think it will either I I Can't imagine first of all a pro baseball team coming here one and two\nOf the really really would they first of all they tear down the Rio to put a baseball stadium when they have a lot of other places that you could actually have a lot of empty lots of places they can actually build a baseball stadium if they are really serious about this insanity you know do it somewhere else\nRight taken down hotel is not like taking on a one story house you took a puppy thirty forty fifty million dollars just to just declare that plays out a lot\nAnd then after rebuild an enclosed stadium and how many people are really going to come here and and and and I think Tony said to me that if they were supposed to be as a team here it had to be American League was that right something like that yeah ... and so with all due disrespect who cares what\nThe American you know yeah I'm a Dodger fan so thank you well how about the good with my friend\nPre Shiites actually thanks so much for joining us seven three three K accent is seven three three ... where did you hear that by the way about the American league um just have to ... none of that you hear that ... were ... you said if they ever had one it would have to be American League\nYeah that was a earlier this year when they had all that talk about the NBA coming to Las Vegas yeah major league so when the major leagues when major league baseball responded to it they said that ah when they they're actually in talks right now about possibly\nDoing an expansion in the two team expansion because the thing is that uh the Seattle Mariners are I guess the problem is that they were looking at Oregon to put a team there because the proximity to Oakland\nIs too far and there's nobody else east of Seattle to play so there's there's no real rivalry with the ... with Seattle Mariners\nAnd the whole talk about that was if they work if they weren't going to do an expansion it would be Oregon as a National League team in Las Vegas and the American league team but that again it was all talk there was nothing really ever going to be confirmed in and they'll be really again like that caller said\nYou would have to do a retractable stadium here just like they did in Phoenix\nIt'll be too expensive you'd have to have it in closed aim you'd I talked about that yeah I mean you'd have to have an enclosed because it'd be too hot a lot of times throughout\nThe well known there's only certain times of the year the rest of the time at the beginning of the remember baseball is a very long season is Bob and do that to me you're talking about ... march April May yeah still decent enough to play outdoors\nSo that's kind of the issue with that and the thing is that a lot of stadiums are built totally enclosed they're not the greatest player places to play in a lot of the players suffer for that\nAnd and the isn't the raiders stadium going to have retractable roof on it you\nKnow they'll have retractable panels panels window there shape [laughter]\nYou know they ... they didn't want to be able to have people have the view outside\nReview and then again if the raiders there you can't get any worse than they are now\nYeah hot or cold and does a minor well yes the ... tomorrow Dodgers brewers what time for pm playing a game show five o nine\nIs first pitch well yeah sports radio eleven forty like go Dodgers ah yeah\n... ... Shaw day tomorrow is it really is a they announced him\nStrange but as of yesterday it was ... okay I ... heard it was going to be ... opening up well are there again that goes on today too so I can double check and it is still car shop for tomorrow right against guns out as I don't know ... I've got to occur Shabaab ahead says you've got the ... light is\nIt is nice\nSeventy three ... three three five nine six eight really they I mean would you support would you want to go to support\nA baseball team here and you know baseball I don't know I just should go to LA once or twice a year and go see the Dodgers myself\n[laughter]\nAll right I'm just saying this you know and I mean we still have to go to summer Linda watch uh you know\nOakland Oakland minor so\nReally I think the quarter that's that's cool that's where you know I Know that is cool do you like to say but I think we're trying to get too much too quick I think you got way too that we got to get the raiders or first twenty twenty and see how that pans out or you can be great but why LA this summer league will keep the NBA summer league will will keep the WNBA\nWe we got the nights and I'm toning always nice that's fine yeah let's let's we're going to quick\nYeah bring back Ozzie Osborne oh hey you need that little chicken or whatever whatever honoring back the regulars algae even if it the one I remember the wrangler all the little half court over it uh yeah but that was a long time ago for that long ago on non down\nSeemed like it [laughter] and it was free parking too badly ah okay Seventy three Seventy seven oh come on and it was Seventy three ... three five nine six eight\nWe got a lot more going on this afternoon at over here we'll be talking about the those residents are concerned about a proposed apartment complex where a lot of people live so high density housing again and and multi family housing ... that you know we'll talk about all of that uh I I Will let you know with this\nThe Senate candidate in in ...
