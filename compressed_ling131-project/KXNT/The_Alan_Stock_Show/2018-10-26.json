member I told you about that [noise]\nOkay well uh NBC News learned in late September that a woman identified by Julie sweat neck as a witness to Brett Kavanaugh of sexual misconduct\nDenied ever having witnessed the conduct they got that information of September but guess what you're ready Jamie\nThey failed to report that information and be seen as contacted a woman she said could corroborate her allegation that cabinet spike the punch had numerous parties in high school or to facilitate gang rapes now the un identified woman said she did not meet sweat neck until they were both\nAdults\nAnd she denied ever having witnessed Kavanaugh spike and he was drink or act in an inappropriate matter toward anyone\nMm Mm [noise] so think about that on October\nSecond after the NBC interview which sweating to backtrack from her earlier claims her attorney the sleazy porn lawyer\nOr an lawyer Michael ... provided a statement attributed to the same identified woman to the Senate Judiciary committee which corroborate his clients allegations\nThe statement why this identify\nWomen read the following during the years Nineteen eighty one eighty two I witnessed firsthand Brett Kavanaugh to gather with others spike the punch at house parties I attended with Claire Lewis and or grain alcohol\nI understood that this was being done for the purpose of making girls more than likely to engage in sexual acts and less likely to say now\nThat's how the statement read so NBC\nSpeaks to the woman again October forth they asked her why she had had this written statement contradicted her earlier claims\nAt which point she reiterated she had never witness Kavanaugh engaged and they conduct described\nSo they asked her at NBC News why she would sign a statement to the contrary and the woman accused ... of the sleazy foreign lawyer of twisting her words and said she only skimmed the state many prepared for her before signing it\nSo apparently what happened is I've been out a ... report or\nMisrepresented the woman's claims and NBC didn't reveal any of this at all until this week didn't say a word about until Wednesday night\nGot it\nSo I'm\nSet of Judiciary Committee chairman Chuck Grassley has referred ... and sweat next to the department of justice did that yesterday we talked about the criminal investigation related to the issue of false statements to
