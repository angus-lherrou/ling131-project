I can never still figure that out I could never figure it out\nObviously is is a huge attraction to some people so he came in a short above a category ... storm was just below a category five sea waters are some areas as high as fourteen feet\nAbove normal so a company I'm just a few moments we'll talk with\nDavid searing and again from him will get a first hand I report as to how things look down there right now there were nearly thirty million people in the path of this storm so\nSo uh we're expected to report\nIt anytime a by I ah I'm David sharing Destin, Florida those regarding the hurricane Michael's situation which we'd be keeping our eyes on this thing I'm really a shutdown big time in Florida and we've\nWatched a lot of the destruction a hundred and fifty five miles per hour plus a the panhandle if you ... ... it looks like a war zone\nIt looks like an ... ah there's absolute devastation going on and a houses are literally crushed people caught under cars well buildings piled bound up on them boats are piled up on ... on one another\nYou know while the ... while the seashore looked like a complete carnage\nIt was a there were\nIn the hit the continental United States and nearly fifty years I've actually heard a hundred years but they're saying you're fifty years so I'm going to go with them\nBut as a as a um the the whole thing is the category form store crashed the shore or early in the afternoon Nick near Mexico beach that happens to be a tourist town about midway along the panhandle in that area right there was lightly populated\nBut other people had to evacuate their homes\nTo make sure that that they got on time those who didn't were just told the batten down the hatches and and stay in place and don't go anywhere\nSo um\nYeah we're I Know a lot of people you know who are the kind of community here where people have moved here from a lot of different places around the country a lot of different places\nThere are people who are born and raised here we know that but also with so many people have moved here from around the country and many have come from Florida and I know you're concerned about your family and your friends and we want to be able to get\nThat information to you as soon as possible so we will continue to keep our eye on this and hopefully get a first hand I report coming up\nJust a few moments weddings I Want to remind we have lots and lots of them and it's going to like you know get right into Michael Bloomberg is a one step closer to announcing his presidential run a he is now\nThe three things is a lot of things you could call and but one of the things he is he's a former Republican and he left the party he's also former independent yeah and he is now a Democrat he's part of the Democratic party he's officially returned\nAnd so uh he is eyeing running as a um\nA as as a Democrat against apparently just a President Trump and twenty twenty\nAnd we will keep our eye on that and see when and if he announced his candidacy ... he wants to run to a lot of people do\nGet a lot more going on this afternoon and I want to get to it I'm One of the things we do want to keep your attention to though is what is going on in uh in Florida\nAnd I think right now if I'm not mistaken right we're going to go to a David searing he is in Destin, Florida as we talk and David thanks so much for being with us after we appreciate it\nAllen how's everything in Vegas\nWell here things are absolutely beautiful I've got to ask you how are things down in Florida where you're at are you you're obviously safe we're talking so you're okay how are things there\nYeah well it started to ramp down for us or if you are not familiar with ... we were on the western side of the storm which is a clean side where there's two sides that we\nRefer to the cleaning the dirty we're on the clean side but even though the clean side and I live right on the water or we were um a tracking a winds up Chastain won't get a hundred and ten miles an hour which is\nReally strong to end up but it started around down right now but to the to the east of us there is catastrophic damage in Pensacola Beach Pensacola shitty and Mexico beach in fact Mexico beach is now floating in the Gulf of Mexico\nOh my gosh yeah\nThey say Mexico beach also was lightly populated so I'm I'm hoping assuming that uh we we don't have any reports of any deaths from this particular storm\nYou know right now I haven't heard anything I'm Still waiting to hear from um the county which is bay a mercy management to ah get a ... of course it's gonna take awhile Allen because these guys are just are able to get in\nAnd because you got to understand they're sixteen feet of water in some places and there are huge trees that are down in their buildings that are no longer standing so it's it's going to probably be the rest of the afternoon and evening and in the morning where we actually did a pretty good the idea of how bad or how many casualties are actually were\nI was watching and listening both today and I know the governor said you know get out as soon as you can if were those who eventually could not get out once a a hurricane Michael hits shore they said just batten down the hatches and stay hunker down and um and pray for the best\nAs exactly right and from all indications are I think in in ... and the authorities think most people heated the worry and they left um so that's a good thing especially in the area that was was hit the hardest now the bad thing for them is\nOnce you leave a if it'll be a while before you can get back because there is no power um uh and and and there again you know\nIt's very dangerous with power lines in the water you don't really walking around in ... in a in a puddle or a pool of water with power lines because uh electricity and water don't mix very well as I'm sure you know\nNo not at least ... you know I've got to ask you say you live down in that area\nAnd I I I live here in in in the van and where we have you know every once in a while we have a monsoon it blows over I grew up in Southern California where we had a ... or some earthquakes and the little rumbling rock and roll and it's gone but I must be a certain type of constitution and I I Am I'm saying this with with with respect\nTo be able to live in an area like Florida a lot of the parts Florida we're a year after year there are problems like this that occur\nAnd you've lived there for a probably some time I mean twenty six years so it it must take a certain kind of you know commitment and constitution to to withstand these kinds of things every year\nRight when you have to adapt your life basically around them for instance where you live what\nKind of house you live in now any\nHouse was built in four in the state of Florida are after hurricane hopeful went through a it's a state law that if you build a house if you build an office building anything you build a structure\nYou have got to have hurricane windows which are a hundred and forty rated plus a for when I'm and then if you don't have that you change your windows in your house you can't just have one\nIf you have thirty windows you can't just take you got to change all of them well and if you if you don't put the hurricane rated in you have to have hurricane shutters so you'd have to your life to it and here again a Allen is the good thing about these hurricanes is that we're we see them relevant mans\nWhere were you guys out in California you you don't have any advance notice of earthquake or or even the wildfires that you have so are are sorry in Nevada I\nApologize do either one I mean we you know hurricanes and we don't have an advance warning for either one of the ... yeah\nRight so so there is you adapt your life to it and um you know either life you know but uh\nIt's it's a it's for instance this hurricane here we this is the first hurricane we've had in this area a major hurricane or in the ... since Nineteen eighty five so it tells you know but not every year there\nOn the east coast or in the opposite they mostly stay on the east coast or they go to Louisiana are taxes we\nVery rarely have hurricanes in our area so uh but this one just this thing blew up in three days to a category for almost five and three days that's that's just any any meteorology you speak to will tell you\nThey don't see this at all so a lot of the water has a of the rings ... lifted pretty much or or you\nKnow the the brains are gone um we were very fortunate with the rain here because the the storm was moving at Fifteen miles an hour for that that's a that's a fact will be storm so doesn't give you the opportunity for flooding but what\nIt does do especially in our area all that water that's turning the golf as it moves nor is Becky itself on the dirty side the right side of the storm and when that stone gets to the polls that water is got to go somewhere so now we're looking at catastrophic\nUh a flooding and um I I mean we're talking sixteen twenty feet of water\nGot to go in and then it's got to come back out so that's where a lot of the devastation\nDavid searing are listed one news correspondent down in Destin, Florida I certainly wish you the very very best and everyone down their hope there are no uh uh casualties at all from this\nAnd I wish you the very best and ah and the gods before of being able to rebuild as soon as possible thank you so much for joining us this afternoon and hopefully you and\nThank you for your time we do appreciate it take good care of my friend the well thank you David searing joining us here on Kate ex ante boy I Can't even imagine can you I'm Alan stocked and this is ... ...\nYour own matters November ... and you need the facts\nThe

have family and friends back there wherever there is\nYou want to keep people informed of it and fortunately or David searing did let us know as you heard that at this point there are no fatalities uh and that is a good good thing we certainly hope that holds to be true as well\n... there are all of\nA a first responders you can't say enough about them and I want to give that a boy to our president\nBecause he just didn't do it because the president says he cares a when he was talking to so many people on television or radio earlier there'll be complacent\nHe said get out and if you are there you know nature you have the right to occasion you have a water or what have you ah I'm very proud of him and thank you for taking my call\nBy the way do you have relatives and friends still back there\nI talked to John years or he is actually a in Tampa Bay a and a water search all the way down\nTo Tampa Bay was up over here is a sea wall\nI I Am both a high tides one earlier this morning and one is after hearing about one thirty airports up over here seawall and mass hundreds of miles south\nOf Tallahassee and the death scenario so that shows you the strength and one good thing if anything the red tide there's been devastating the west coast of Florida this year one of the worst and there's just might move a lot of that out and I hope so\nHey my friend L.

write I just\nListen to these people are really now where do I wait what'd you please let us get all of this whole Kavanaugh debacle thing was a sham\nAnd he's going to hide from now on because his name he had that mark on his face\nWell actually actually the first day on the Supreme Court he didn't Heidi unlike other Supreme Court justices he was out there asking a couple of questions and not giving his hand away where he stood on the issue I think it was ...\nHe is despicable let me just say that but as far as what Eric Holder said just let us get over this I I Wish I really really really wish Hillary let's just go away but she won't owners I guess she's you know and she's earned her right to put in our two cents\nBut I kinda like where we're going and I'm seeing that the Senate looks really good for us I Wish she would go away and not mess it up I guess I blame her totally but why we're in this situation why Trump is in office it's all about because of this\nThis sense of entitlement you're not entitled to the presidency\nShe thought she was she mixed up a delegate she's responsible and if I had my way she would go away and hide in New York and never come out\nWhile you know you and I every time we talk we find areas of agreement every time\nI Do not know I don't agree with you\nKnow but wait a minute I'm agree with you that she should have just shut up and go

thanks for getting me on I just wanted them to silence I don't know if you've covered this or not but as he as you know they don't want to know where you're coming down here and not not like that I'd like to see a a people showing up drunk now this is all about\nAnd I've been to the Trump rallies energies on eight and a peaceful turned out that they don't know what are you going to the store owners can turn to you\nAh me I don't I don't think and I got a bit of a triathlon type but they don't go out\nBut I but I think that if there is on every channel her all the way in order to their

little bit of Jones\nA my father never had a I I I I Am absolutely with you I think that we ought to be out there they protest when Trump comes to town we ought to be protesting in huge numbers when the bill and Hillary show\nCome to town and that's exactly what they're going to be doing is going to be a real surface between hilly of course they're going to be talking about about all of his affairs and and her talking about how it's a vast right wing conspiracy we know all of us the James my friends I Do appreciate your call this afternoon it's gonna be a circus trust me\nYes it will be

to look that went up a let me go to a Lewis I believes that right Louis\n... actually I beg your pardon Luis or good afternoon your case city welcome to the show\nA lot of question about um the wrong call comment yes\nFor news says something like that are you referring to in the nation just on one side or both sides\nUm I only know that he said and I'm quoting as the exact word right now a Rand Paul said um\nThat are unfolding as words I fear that there's going to be an assassination I really worry that somebody's going to be killed that those who are ratcheting up the conversation they have to realize they bear some responsibility if this elevates to violence and to quote\nAnd of course we were so we we do know that I ... a year ago this last summer that there was a man who hid and opened fire on on a congressional representatives who were practicing at a at a baseball game\nAnd the right and he tried to kill them so I mean it's not like this is hypothetical this stuff is a ... it's it's Germany as we talk I don't want to see this I I Know you don't either I Know Rand Paul doesn't either\nWell when I first read that uh that article I I thought he was a little kind of out there that well that's a that's a crazy comment to say but as you read it and I've looked at further it seems like ... violence on any side he's just talking about violence in general\nEither on a Democrat or Republican it doesn't matter because you have to remember\nThat a couple of years ago that Gabby Giffords got shot as well\nAnd you know what and and to me that it is again we're talking it was horrendous that that that that occurred and I and I said of the time that that was horrendous I I don't support any buddy and I don't but again you've got Eric Holder's saying when you disagree with somebody can't come\nAnd and you get a a former ... a chief law enforcement official in America advocating violence himself that is insane\nWell yes I'm also during the Gabby Giffords thing\nUm I Believe there was some sort of hoopla with uh like some sort of Congress Congress map of the U.S and it had on the cross hairs on each a state that had a senator or some sort of politician and he didn't he voted out and people are saying but practically kind of at the same thing that kind of like triggered the the the\nOf them was Arizona so this is just\nIt's just the usual ... you know they say they say on both sides that it could be interpreted in any way that's how I'm seeing it\nBy the way I bought it none of the above\nOkay I Know Hillary Clinton showing wanted for herself she wanted to become president just because of her own personal gain she didn't care about people she was representing Everytime she talked it was fake it was a fake person and then Trump he's at the end the so so that's why I think none of the above because I have zero confidence in our leadership\nOkay and that's how I'm gonna tell you my views are because I'm In either side I'm the George Carlin\nAudience I just watch on the sidelines and watch the to fight it over that's how I see it\nBut you are concerned about the continued potential violence you write about Gabby Giffords she got shot in Arizona and you had the uh the um uh the u._s. represent a shot and and we was Marilyn or maybe it was would you know there was Maryland is not much they can but a ... there were shot there and and now\nAnd now you again when when when Eric Holder says kicked him and Hillary Clinton says we can no longer act civil to them\nI mean they are creating an atmosphere that is is is really ratcheting it up\nAnd you're right I mean I I don't I don't want to see anybody on the right or shooting anyone I don't want to see anyone on the left shooting anyone but we are certainly heading in that direction and you know God Knows\nThat's the last thing I Want to see and I I Am telling people just just who just chill a bit\nWell that's why I'm just watching it on the sidelines I'm I'm In either party and um you know I I see it I see the BS on both sides\nOf it I I I ... I Do too I don't you and I was I appreciate you being able to call it like it is which is what you're doing and I and I and\nAnd and I put it in a very short terms very short Democrats pretend to care in the background they don't care Republicans they still be don't care right in front of your face that's how I see it\nRight I listen I appreciate the call my friend called back Daily Times good hearing from seven three three K accent is seven three three five nine six eight\nClothes more coming up next on K ex ante a ...\nVote matters November sex and you need the facts\nPromise you gotta get out for the\nNew wave is we join us as we marched to the midterm fun talking forty three accent\nThe all new radio dot com app is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone\nOr anywhere [noise]\n[noise] hey Sean Spicer and every mid term election since the civil war the president's party is locked an average of thirty two seats in the house of representatives and two in the Senate We're in for what will be a wild political season and there's going to be plenty to discuss and debate and dissect\nShe'll be sure to download my new podcast everything's gonna be alright beginning in October ... and I was an hour long weekly political tide gas covering the very latest news across the country and will provide listeners with unique inside and you can't get anywhere else everything's going to be All right and subscribe and download today on radio dot com and I\nWas just firefighter I feel for yet from firehouse subs introducing new firehouse pub stakes a savory steak crispy fried onions in a rich Belgian beers cheese sauce on top for limited time\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com apple on your smartphone\nFor anywhere\n[noise] hey Sean Spicer and every mid term election since the civil war the president's party has lost an average of thirty two seats in the house of representatives and two in the Senate We're in for what will be a wild political season and there's going to be plenty to discuss and debate and dissect\nShe'll be sure to download my new podcast everything's gonna be alright beginning in October ... and I was an hour long weekly political tide gas covering the very latest news across the country and we provide listeners with unique inside and you can't get anywhere else everything's gonna be All right and subscribe and download today on radio dot com and I to\nListen and imagine [laughter] [noise]\nIt takes five seconds to send a text and for those five seconds\nYoure driving blind life is worth more than a tax stay alive don't text and drive\nStopped ... a message by the by the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration project yellow lights noise and the ad council", "show_name": "The Alan Stock Show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "10"}
