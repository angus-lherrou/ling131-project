Todd pollock cough who is president and CEO of the of Jewish Nevada which is the local Jewish Federation\nOr organization here will be joining us at about three three left to three thirty to talk about uh some of the issues facing the Jewish community and the community at large here in Las Vegas in particular\nWe'll talk with Todd coming up the laughter three thirty a this afternoon we'll we'll talk about that um\n[noise] we get a chance after I I Know it's a it's a heavy time and a lot of heavy things to talk about but I I Do want to also talking about a couple of things which was a little bit lighter a and one of ... happens to be the fact that the\nPresident's ah criticized Dave Roberts\nOr because of the pitching moves that he made during game four\nAnd I've been critical of day Roberts here and we'll talk about the president's tweets\nAnd I'm ... and Roberts response by the way and that would be coming up later on this afternoon also there is a group out there out there is a that wants to actually move Halloween\nTo the last Saturday in October\nWhat\nHe's blaming the victim in this your thoughts please\nYeah you know Sarah Sanders said it perfectly well today which has the president's first act and\nThe pipe bomb situation and of course this heinous act that just happened over the weekend in Pennsylvania was to can damage the horrible heinous ... perpetrators of these acts and the media the first response is to blame the president\nThe president has called for unity he has called for camping down of the blame game of turning these things into political situation these are things that Americans universally of horror\nAnd it's a time where usually we come together as a country and the media wants to find somebody at fault there are only two individuals at fault one is that sick individual who tried to scare Democrat politician and second\nIs disgusting deranged hate filled mad who murder people while they were worshipping at at their synagogue and they are the individual that we should be blaming and focusing on\nNow the president has um is once again to criticize the media today\nA because as saying that they you know it's fake news and everything like that but in in light of what we're ... you are talking about right now I mean is it any wonder you're you're right they attack yeah ... ... ... you know the old cliche if he wants to motivate she couldn't swim uh so I mean no matter what he does the attack him\nAnd I you know I think they set it up so he'll turn around and and blast them back\n[noise] yeah I mean not only does the media they bring up Democrat politician after Democrat politician and they asked them is the president responsible for that and they should be saying of course not just like when Steve Scully was shot on a congressional baseball field with many Republican congressional members\nBernie Sanders was not at fault for that range individual who worshipped Bernie Sanders going and tried to kill Republican and we both have a duty to say in a bipartisan way these are sick to arrange individuals we do not condoning political rhetoric turning into a violent\nPlease take your issues out at the ballot box do not turned violent do not hurt other people because you have differences of opinion politically Democrats aren't doing at\nA time and time again the president has called for unity he has put out an olive branch and it gets real fast\nDemocrats aren't doing that\nA time and time again and the president has called for unity he has put out an olive branch and it gets real fast and the media is stoking the flames of this political divide it's not helpful for our country in a time where we need to be healing\nRonald ... future will join us right now here on the ... and ... in Las Vegas um the ah the election is a week from tomorrow a lot of early voting and started food right here in Las Vegas by the way in in in Nevada um you know the uh I I've watched all the polls his law has been very interesting because\nDemocrats in a lot of races were up\nFor the first few months two months ago and I'm watching as things progress and\nAh what has happened is you should go all the polls show which around now\nAnd I'm In and out it appears that Republicans may actually increase the numbers in the house and the Senate what do you attribute that to\nWell Nevada and have really benefited from the president a job than tax act and fifty four thousand jobs have come to your state\nThe average family is taking home Thirteen hundred dollars more that's a lot of money and I think they recognize that Republicans have delivered result and the Democrats are all about resistance they have nothing to run on except resist and obstruct and as voters took a closer look at the candidates and what they're running on\nRepublicans are getting uh getting more support and that's certainly happening across the state of Nevada and we hope to carry that through till election day for Dean Heller Adam lax out crossing hardy and Danny Tarkanian and all the other races across the state\nThe president event has been I'm\nA ... as being the forefront of being able to help vets which occur\nYeah the president coming in Nevada like he did a last week coming to alcohol I help energize his voters and what he says\nListen I Need more help in Washington I Need people who are going to work with me who want to see good things happen for the American people Democrats literally have nothing to point to that they've accomplished these past few years except resistant obstruct they have done nothing for the American people\nJacky Rosen voted against the tax cuts these are not things that voters want to see and that and they know the Democrats if they get\nPower are going to raise taxes they're going to open borders are going to abolish ice and they're going to continue this past a resistant obstruct and shutting down all the good things that Nevada and are seeing on small businesses are feeling better and Nevada people are doing better because of Republican policies and and that's why they're supporting these candidate\nBut I was at a debate and we go for the a Jacky Rosen versus being our at our local CBS affiliate and was on a panel afterwards regarding that\nUh and you know it was interesting because a Jacky Rosen like a lot of these people have come out and should have been aside from bump stocks we got to get rid of him and the people in bump stocks was shooting industry the bunch last OJ but we've got to get rid of real short weapons also but you ask any of these people wouldn't have short weapon is not one person to define it\n[noise] yeah I mean Jacky Rosen is a is in line with Chuck Schumer she is supported by ham she would hand picked by him and it's not surprising that she's going to line up with\nThe New York liberal view that Chuck Schumer or the San Francisco liberal views of Nancy fluffy and that doesn't represent many people and the state of Nevada and across the country settled Jackie rose and if she goes to Washington will be a a supporter wholeheartedly in lockstep with Chuck Schumer Dean Heller will represent the people at the state\nWe are a a fiercely independent state and\nThe in lockstep with Chuck Schumer Dean Heller will represent the people at the state\nYeah we are a a fiercely independent state and uh I Would say most people that I Know own firearms yeah and not one of them is an state law one is unstable but they have it in case God Forbid they ever have to use it and uh for\nJackie rose in some of the other lips to try to want to say well we've got to get rid of it because you don't know what you're doing is is is very very condescending actually unconscionable listen I appreciate your taking time to join us do you also feel that it's possible real quick that we are we'll wind up the Republicans will wind up actually\nA retaining the Senate and house\nI think we keep the Senate which is unprecedented usually the party that hold the White House and that first maternal is two to three seats in the Senate and the house on average ... thirty Nevada will be key to helping us keep the house or if we can all that crap and hardy and Danny Danny Tarkanian we can keep the house that your state\nIs so important that by the audience he's been there for two years with over thirty six yeah on the ground trying to turn out are about but uh I'm hopeful that we can keep the house is about thirty races within the margin of error that don't make that difference\nAlright appreciate your time to join us thank you very much and of course the very best of luck good to ah the all the Republicans coming up a week from tomorrow thank you so much for being with us we do appreciate it\nThanks for

I was in I Believe that people have gotten to take responsibility for their own well being in the same article you're quoted in by the way as soon as the rabbi Mindy Harley of my bottom green valley saying that they have um you know they've taken\nA steps to ... you know to to secure their their synagogue are also a rabbi Malcolm Cohen from temple Sinai says they also have an armed guards are considering other measures\nI mean whether it's a synagogue or a church black or white doesn't matter what is it wise in this day and age to be able to have as much protection as possible\nAbs absolutely a hundred percent and and the ... you know it's interesting one of the the evolution of this if you look at Joyce federations around the country and I I'm Talking about some of the largest federation Cleveland's that the Atlantis they there's a position now on staff that has never been and it's a director of security\nI mean these some of these people are former FBI field agents who have retired now heads of community security and they treat you as communities as though they're college campuses\nBecause you know as you know the community isn't one building correct um we have thirty plus congregations here\nUh I'll tell you from my previous work one one off duty police officer in a synagogue a year is up words the forty thousand dollars or more expense All right we're thirty plus congregations\nAnd they have varying levels of of ability to pay that amount right um so that also is a calculus it's part of the calculus in the ... of a physical security\nBut absolutely every synagogue and I think I think the majority of them some of them don't talk about what their security measures are right or I could tell you that the majority of our congregations in this community\nHave a security plan certainly our schools have a security plan or all of our organizations as far as I Know we had a meeting\nUm it was last year during the Jaycee see that the bomb hoax a that went throughout the country we were not immune to it or we called a meeting of all of the organizations\nAlong with the local police who I have to tell you in this community unbelievable relationship we can't say enough about the work that metro and the fusion center and Henderson in North Las Vegas do for our community\nUm there there we consider them part of our community there are so close to us um but I think everyone is is taking steps and has been taking steps it's a question of whether or not you see it um and some of them your rights are much more outwardly visible you can see the armed guards in front of the building\nUm I Know at high holidays there are several synagogues in town who have members who are police officers and they ask those police officers to carry a in in temple in synagogue during holidays you know they don't ask them to stand by the door but they say if you're coming to services\nPlease bring your your weapon with you as a police officer and uh they consider that a level of security\nMean they they the synagogue those shot up in Pittsburgh they do also hire armed guards during the holidays but I'm saying you know what every Friday night Saturday in a synagogue\n... is a high holiday every Sunday in a church is a high holiday so to speak what I'm saying is that that sense of vulnerability you talk about exist regardless of the day of the week or the week of the month or the month of the year whatever holiday it is and and you know ... ...\nTalk about exist regardless of the day of the week or the week of the month or the month of the year whatever holiday it is and and you know ... how many of our um uh and you're right that all talking about what they do and that's good that's good\nBut what what what how many of our resorts also have beefed up their security and they're profiling of people's behavior since last October one\nYeah now that it is if you look at our society in general um and I know you've been Israel I spent an extensive amount of time in Israel you've been there a lot\nUm you know we are slowly evolving towards a society where you see far more security than you did ten years ago um ... you know I think it's only a matter of time before we have people who are checked as they walk in the shopping malls I'm you know that's that's where we are um\nAnd I again I think there's two levels of the security one is the underlying issues of how these people get to this point where they\nThey turn to violence on people but really it's the physical security that uh is is another level of this and and the challenge in our Jewish community is that\nAll these organizations are separate organizations and if the congregation feels that they want that security that level of security they'll have it if they don't want it as a choice of the congregation they don't have it and there's no one to mandate to them that they have to have it\nUm but I Know that everyone in this community has been taking more and more you know further measures\nAre for physical plant security\nYou know I I think that's that's a wise move again a synagogue certainly I'm concerned about but also churches given what has happened to various churches around those last few years uh and schools\nI mean we've got to think in terms of schools as well those are always set up for this kind of insanity and again you can never you never determine which person is gonna flip out or not and a faith\nBased community that his immune from this I don't care if it's a church or mosque a Buddhist temple you know we've seen Sikhs we there there is no faith based community that's immune from this\nNo absolutely the case and again there's no way to determine who's gonna flip out what time uh and uh and and you've we've got to all of us all of us you and me all this we've got to take responsibility for our own well being\nGet together with members of our religious organizations and make sure that they are doing something to make sure that we do not have this happened here in Las Vegas and willing they'll it'll happen across the entire country\nAnd we have to pay attention when we see people who are who who's rhetoric and who's whether it's online somewhere else\nGets to the point where it starts to feel like this isn't normal or this is this is far beyond the pale or we it's our responsibility to make sure the authorities are aware of at least make an effort that regard\nWhen it starts crossing that line and we all know that line in the in the old saying may not be able to define of you know you feel you understand but when when you start it starts crossing that line\nUh say some see to see something say something and and I I'm I'm with you a hundred percent ... the president CEO of Jewish Nevada

three five nine six eight\nEight Foxman the former head of the a deal ah was um um\nHe he wrote about this because I knew were blaming Trump for Pittsburgh he says Trump is part of the problem but not the problem and I don't agree that he's part of the problem but nonetheless that's what Foxman rights but he actually defended the U.S president from charge that he's the blame for Saturday's massacre\nHe goes on to talk about uh the president does not understand the consequences of his political rhetoric that when he speaks what issues like immigration globalization and gun control it ignites bigots like Pittsburgh murder and then that's the guy's name who by the way the guy who shot up the synagogue hated Trump\nOr FYE I I'm\n... blame Trump for a lot of the problems All right so

to so many years I've talked about the issue of illegal immigration\nIllegal immigration illegal immigrant I talked about it a lot and\nEvery time I talk about it there are some out there who will say oh see you're anti immigrant trying to twist the words try to um censor what I say and be able to say that I've said something I didn't say\nI have never ever said that I was anti immigrant the president is never said that but he and a lot of us are anti illegal immigrant big difference between that and immigration as a whole globalization\nYeah the idea that we are proud of this nation and don't want to become mixed in to the rest of 'em\nSo the rest of his and ... the ... the global mishmash that's going on yeah we want we are posed a globalization and gun control or if those issues ignite bigots\nThat I'm Sorry then people are misunderstanding which really igniting of these people what Foxman goes on to talk about a couple of other things and specifically talk about what a has
