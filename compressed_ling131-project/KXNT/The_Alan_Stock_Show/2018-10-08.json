writing was always a part of it there I was always always always always always always nerd right I think part of it is that I Love that and I love nice in armor and I love than dragons and all of those things all the stories were around\nFighting men all around um the projection of violence power of force that justice on this is what will green does right is what I mean these are people like\nUm for what's right and when you're impressionable kid those things really\nYou know dig it in the ... and they never left me very well and I would be a writer in the military um but I think that everybody in my family and all my friends are like\nYou did what [laughter] when it happened um but yeah I wrote my entire life and then as it began to absorb by nights and weekends and kind of\nUm I traded a social life for it to a large extent and I didn't go pro and still when he well when I was in my late ...\nYou know I finished my day job or I close my laptop and I opened my eyes and I I started the next but\nWe're speaking with Mike Cole coast guard veteran author TV star man of many titles of course there are two titles as of now in the secret thrown series which is your latest book three is coming soon a book to ah just coming out this month\nWhat was the start for you when did you first started getting paid to write and how did that happen I mean did they see you out did you have to go hunting for a publisher how\nDoes that work for the uninsured so um\nIt's really really really really hard I have to be clear I I it\nTook me Fifteen Years of writing I'm a ... nights and weekends that really I I wrote I think we're complete novels before I finally sold one\nAnd I I did tons of research I found the age and I want to represent me I Would ... stock him at a party [laughter]\nUm and then we hung out in the lobby of a of a hotel room a video of a hotel and silly until\nThree in the morning with me talking to him about anything but writing just trying to make friends with the guy um and luckily it worked off even a even a workout but even after that um\nYou know he's still rejected another you know two three manuscripts of mine before I finally gave them something that he could use ironically I gave him my\nFourth novel stuff novels and novels that would become control when I first novel that so and then I went to Iraq and I told them not only what you thought\nBecause I needed my head and the game and if he liked it it would you know I did see Jack up because he liked it and if he didn't like it I did to bomb because he didn't like it it turns out he loved it and he called my friend Pete a ... brat who isn't super sledgehammer fantasy author of your listeners haven't um\nRead his demon cycle series or demand first\nOne that is amazing um but my agent called him was like a ... you know ready to take it to market and the it was like I'm like so I spent four months of my life or in Iraq or\nYou know not knowing that [laughter] that uh I had a book that I was ready to take out and even then when he took it to market it was still a year and a half of it getting rejected by every major publisher\nI'm In the English speaking language and finally a drop 'em said they would consider it on a fifty percent rewrite its rock being the main fantasy and science fiction imprint of payment Random House\nAnd uh I'll tell you I once I had gotten after all those years of trying and after getting a superstar agent my agent represents um rented Sanderson he represents shutting Harris the woman whose books became the True Blood series on HBO so I really had major backing with this guy\nAnd still be rejected by all the publishers and only have one publisher considered a sixty percent ... I Can't tell you\nHow depressing that was I turned into a mosque or I was just a miserable human being ... and uh but I get it and are amazingly enough um that's just ... percent rewrite got me over the hump and and uh and got the book published but yeah getting my first book deal\nI'm is one of the hardest things if not the hardest thing I've ever done and that would also say that each subsequent book deal you you have to go get\nMaybe it's a little bit easier than if you've never published before\nBut not much I mean it's unless you are power office or random standards and one of these writers who you know they could just published a grocery list and millions of people\nAre going to buy it um it's always always always enough they'll struggle and that kind of not you know getting a drawn out of the way of getting the lowest me out a way of focusing on the work that's something I absolutely learned in the United states coast are incredibly grateful for\nWe've talked to several other authors musicians\nThe arts and one recurring theme with them is is the difficulty these days in particular in the music industry and in the literature industry of getting to that point they all have different recommendations or remember one telling us\nYou know don't count on it to be your job make sure that you have a backup plan keep doing what you love work on it but also have a plan B have another route that you can go what would you recommend to the aspiring veteran authors out there\nSome do work uh I mean you have to obviously have a day job stuff like that but um but it's really that um\nIt's it's the work if nothing else on don't worry about marketing don't worry about who you know don't worry about any of that\nWorried about writing a dynamite book you write a fantastic book it we'll find 'em and I know people will say rules so much junk is published in so many good books get passed over yeah that's true but those were outliers outliers in general when you write fantastic work work that releasing work that is amazing\nYou know publishers are not stupid they're going to see that and they're going to and they're going to walk by it because they they are going to do it will make them money I'm so there's a lot of mystery around being a success in the arts and a lot of alchemy and people trying to figure it out you know the right look the right\nTo be the right place make the right seat no no no no no\nIt is the quality of the work focused on writing an amazing book when you read your own manuscript and you say this is as good as anything you know George R Martin has ever written this is as good as anything that we know that has ever written this is as good as anything Ursula killer glasses ever written when you feel that\nUh and when your data readers your friends who are looking at it for you feel that then you're ready to just start finding an agent before that you focus on crap\nAnd how do you focus on crap you read the book of the great right and you\nPick apart what they're doing read like a boxer watches a fight that he ... an opponent um you take riding horses you um and most of all you practice you sit on your butt in a chair and you write and you're right and you're right and you read what you wrote and throw it away and you're right um but yeah Kraft\nCrap that is my number one that\nWe're speaking with Mike coal miner renaissance man an author or a TV star in of course a coast guard veteran having served in the United states coast guard until well a few years ago as he told us one of the most difficult decisions he's ever made in his life\nThis most recent series is the sacred thrown series book to the queen of prose coming out this month a question for you about the literary community is there much of a veteran presence in the literature community or is there you know a group of veterans you know of who are writing that you maybe keep in touch with or anything like that\nAlso you have to keep in mind that the literature community isn't knowledge it's on it tends to aggregate by Sean so my community as a science fiction and fantasy um and\nThere are there are a few veterans but very few what's next for you I Know you've got a book that just came out you've got books three in that series coming out soon what's next for Michael so um\nI've got a third book in a sacred runs through the killing light which I Am doing my file at San she'll be turning that in\nTo my agent about ten days I have a new series which is actually an unsettled I'm with a robot which is um about the future of the coasts are it's about the coast guard's mission when the U.S has colonized the mood I'm so I'm really excited about that are two books under contract there\nThe thing that I've been blessed to do\nIs being able to show the entire world or the international stage my transition of leaving the military and doing what I Am doing now and it's been it's been difficult times there are times that um\nI don't feel motivated I don't feel like I Want to share a part of my life but that's what social media has turned into that's what people you know the measures that get if you if you looked at my message box it's insane there's you know your negative messages and then in a positive messages and\nYou get guys in there like I I I had a guy like three nights ago a navy veteran suicide a survivor talked about you know watching the gaming stop watching this stuff that we do has been somewhat tackle that it's given him something to look forward to\nAnd that right there is what makes it all worth it that's what makes the drive or the you know because there are times that like I just want to give it up as they get stupid you know but then you get that message\nOf empowerment of the damn that's that's amazing that's incredible and it just it feels you'd want to do more goodness because to be perfectly open that up these last three years two years stepping out there's been a lot of anger\nA lot of anger inside of me and I didn't know where to cure it towards and I didn't know what the cause of it was it was just anger of having been through four and a half years of Iraq and Afghanistan from ... to the ... river valleys and stuff like that of the worst fighting out there\nAnd there's just a lot of internalized anger and I could figure out why and maybe it's because you come back to America and you see it and the state of\nLike this is not what we thought for we fought for America to be America to be United in a sense but we're not\nWhich you know in a sense is\nThe Democratic process that democracy you know we don't we don't have United we we are able to disagree and stuff but\nOver the last two or three years it's been trying to find that anger and channel in a positive direction and kind of go through this transition on the stage and let other people see into my life that people that are following me for years that have told me that\nYou know I remember when you were first doing this a member when you were doing this to see where you are now and it's nice to see you're actually finally try to come up through that that whole in the ground\nAnd understand that life is worth living and it's worth living happy don't we don't let the let that anger consume you inside it for the longest time\nIt's just very easy to like that that that that inner demon control your mind how you look at things had to talk to people or you do various things I still\nGet on YouTube and do my my funny comedic thing sometimes with the drill start sometimes up to the comedic thing it's all about flying around and you know will work but the biggest advice I can give anyone transitioning out of the military that is fine something's going to make you happy\nKeep your hands busy with a hobby and uh\nI I'd go that direction don't get out of the military without a direction because we'd\nBeen trained to always have a mission you know when you're coming back from deployment you're immediately go to reset and you're going back into team or a fire squad life by a company like fire you got something you're training for it you know that you're on the patch chart you're about to deploy in six months you're training for something then when you get out man I'm telling you\nYou are so much more than that uniform you are so much more than that uniform and I'm not I'm not criticizing the uniform on that the meeting it\nBut what I Am saying is there is more death to you at any one of the things that they are just a uniform it intellectually shallow unique to delve deeper into who it is that you are as an individual and understand that individuality as what you bring to the army\nAnd then once you leave the army you take the individuality with you\nAnd you expand upon it and then you explore new avenues new thing that you ever seen or done your entire life grow your hair long grow up here don't listen to a new type of music do take an art class go with acting class write poetry do video game\nTry things that you were always afraid to try before because let's be honest and a warrior culture\nWhere you were taught to think and feel a certain way you got to be hard to talk and I agree that it does exist because that's what's needed for war fighters but once you're out of that environment\nBuying something that makes you happy and don't let that inner anger consume you because that's just not a life worth living and the guy that we left over there would not want you were living a life like that\nWhen we return we'll have more with TV stars

junior slammed Whoopi Goldberg after she said the only reason he might want to judge Brett Kavanaugh to be given a fair trials because he believes his sons might have rapist tendencies is what Whoopi says\n\nThe um Donald Trump junior ...\nFor a future in which mere accusations without evidence or due process or enough to cost a man his job he said I've got boys and I would ... I bet girls when I see what's going on\nAnd the interview a precedent for what whether he was more worried about his sons or daughters and he said right now I mean I'd I'd say my son's the other problem is that for the people are real victims of these things when it's so obviously is political in cases like this it really diminishes the real flames\nSo uh would be a is on her show or the rear view and she says the only worried about this for your child if you think your child has these tendencies feeding your child is not someone who is assaulting people it shouldn't be concerned for you\nAnd then he went on to say this he responded\nTo her that it wasn't just horrible pathetic and growl a study what after his kids that she went after his kids but also hypocritical because he reminded everyone that she defended a convicted child rapist Roman Polanski\nHe tweeted out Whoopi Goldberg instead of insinuating that my son is a potential future abusers you might want to explain why you defend that actual child rapist Roman Polanski she tweeted at one point I don't believe it was rape rape that's what she says wasn't rape rape this is science like Bill Clinton with is is right she think it was rape rape\nShe um\nShe had once said that we're a different kind we're different kinds of society we see things differently the world sees Thirteen year olds and fourteen year olds and the rest of Europe\nNot everybody agrees the way we see things and he treats factor ... I agree with the way we see things if you mean that believing that Thirteen year old girls are too young to be able to give consent grown men\nRoman Polanski by the way a convicted of raping a Thirteen year old the ... drugs and then he raped her but according to what the Colbert wasn't rape rape\nLike is is you know\nThat and by the way it is because in parts of Europe they may and and now you're ... parts of the middle east you know how they\nThey see Thirteen year old girls is like fodder for [laughter] some old guy dripping as it is ... she's a Thirteen year old girl you know yeah you know so she goes like this how they see girls in some parts of the world just because we see them differently here\nWhat an what an idiot she is I mean really she's be on crazy\nRight you hit the general idea I mean all that you can't make this stuff up none of it at all\nSen Lindsey Graham says he's going to be campaigning against the Democrats who opposed the Kavanaugh I've ever campaigned against the colleague in my life\nThat's about to change you've been on the warpath against those opposed a Jew or two grand ever since the very beginning so good for him for for going after them absolutely good for him for that\nAll right um and let me just like you know when I say to you about the fact that I think that the\nWhole cabinet situation is going to benefit Republicans more than Democrats\nI just want to give you a little bit of a hit what I'm Talking about and that is that I'm Ted Cruz who the one point was actually behind this ... or ... guy\nA new Emerson College poll has come out and shows cruise leading or Rourke forty seven to forty two percent\nSo things have switched around this entire country things have switched around three months ago people thought Democrats are going to take over the Senate in the house and everything now it looks like Republicans may not only retain the house and Senate but maybe add to it\nThat's what's going on right now seven three three\nTwenty seven three three five nights that say you tell me whether or not you think that this cabinet debacle is going to help Democrats or Republicans icy that's going to help the um the Republicans Stormy Daniels in the news they why that is the case and just ... and she\nVery government she can terms of homes and Jared rejects shooters coast to coast germs twenty thousand lived and released in one night while talking forty am ... I\nRemember thinking mom had ice in the back of her head like or a superpower was spot in trouble before it happened well now it's on us to protect our home and family and spotting troubles way tougher\nThat's why parents trust blink blamed video cameras are motion activated so placing them around your home because like having ice everywhere\nBut that's all they're recommending and of course most people look at the un like they're crazy\nIf you didn't every mentioned this earlier by the way bill and Hillary coming to Las Vegas on November Eighteenth so um how your daughter's that's all I can say 'cause she'll go to sleep at night and he'll be gotten around I mean\nKnow that he does that\nAh\nWhen I remember when that\nWoman was a burn from McDonald's a long time ago because the coffee was too hot she wound up getting three million dollars in damages\nCell in the back is back in Nineteen Ninety four and she got all kinds of burns and they're like that\nWell with all due thoughts encourage that you would think that McDonalds people like that would have learned of course people should be careful what you do but in this case or this isn't happening in Oregon\nSo they're actually being sued McDonalds up there for one point five six million\nBy a fourteen year old girl who claims she suffered serious burns on her abdomen and lower body by scalding cup of hot water allegedly shirt and spilled out her by a restaurant employee\nSo it wasn't something that they served and she actually spilled an employee eat supposedly did this and I and and they've October for the file this uh this lawsuit\nSending employ serve the un identified minor a dangerously hot cup of water on July twenty ninth of last year water spilled on the team causing partial a thickness burns or second degree burns on her abdomen and lower body\nAnd she suffered a also problems on the extra layer of skin in Germany suffered damage so they're suing McDonalds big time\nAnd you would think that\nKnow they would somehow ... learned how to avoid something like that apparently they need some training inside their restaurant and it's a shame that the girl with is the first place up ... very very unfortunate\nUm\nSomething else that uh uh Tony enemy early on I Want to talk about this a few moments and that is the uh there is a group out there you can imagine who they are they're they're ... they want felons to regain the right to vote\nAnd\nI don't know I talk a lot of people say what you serve your your time there is no reason that you shouldn't be allowed to vote again but then I read into this I mean this whole thing and I thought to myself this is very very strange\nBecause a beginning in January Nevada residents or convicted of certain felonies leather voting rights restored automatically\nListen to this one and here's where it gets me even if they are dishonorable discharge from their parole sentence that means they serve the time they did parole but they were really jerks and uh and and they were you know you don't know if they're going to really a\nRe offend or not this honorably discharged you can't get certain jobs in this country if you are dishonorable discharge from the military you know that don't you\n\nSo all these will be automatically given this is the a legislature that created this uh I think a last legislative session\nAnd\nObviously it's not just Democrats with the governor signed it so this is with with the governor and and the legislature are all thinking that should be a normal motive of of of things to do I I I find this to be amazing\nI understand individuals' want to petition the governor and and\nHave their rights restored but automatically that's what it says you're automatically restore them even for dishonorable discharge or people\nThat are residents could also apply to have their court records sealed which can restore\nSo we're not talking about somebody who possessed a joint people always say that you know people are in prison rotted years because they out of joint not that's that's a lot of crap that that that doesn't exist\nUsually if it's involving drugs because you are a major dealer\nBig different than a person who just uses any drug at all and I that's just before\nI don't believe in throwing anybody in prison whatsoever for using drugs are not unless I'm uh getting an axis and driving and talking about just in your own if somebody's using and they find you're using heroine whenever I was reading in prison\nI Would put people in treatment but I Would not throw people in prison that you want a deal if you want to deal drugs like that heroin in ... okay maybe and I would I Would put you in prison for fifty sixty years without the possibility of parole\nIf you deal drugs\nFor using it you know what I'm I wouldn't put in for a day I Would put you in the treatment\nSo when you talk about people can apply to other court record CEO which can restore voting rights certain felonies they're not talking about simple possession of a joint or something like that which some people would like to think is the case\nRight boy can I make this stuff up and I\nI Know I have this whole thing you gave me here about the about the limo driver in New York were twenty people were killed I don't know what to say about that obviously the the uh the driver wasn't properly license the limo failed inspection they have two other limos I understand this company and I guess they're going to go after the company\nBut it's a daily in the dollar short for the twenty people four sisters one family and in many I'm just a little thing is is atrocious\nI it's hard to even talk about it so bad really is\nSo what I'll do instead of because I've got a lot of things that get into during the next hour but I Do want to get into a this um one of these thoughts about um will wrap this went up like Christie Christie lousy forward and the article that she co authored\nOn hypnotic memory retrieval and what impact what influence that may have had what significance that may have had a on her testimony before the Senate Judiciary committee which by the way I'm Still calling for a
