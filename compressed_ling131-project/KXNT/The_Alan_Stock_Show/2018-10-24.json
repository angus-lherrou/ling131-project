worth bombing anything period\nI'm not condoning that in any way I think it's absolutely asinine\nI also think what is absolutely crazy is the coverage and the conspiracy theories\nAll coming out of this now\nThis CNN portion of this is the the thing that that has my eyes the most\nAnti I have two of those most eight years the reason why CNN was actual reporting on the explosive device found near the Clintons home and the Obamas home\nAnd then alarm started going off live on air and the anchors just they they they were pros I give them credit for this because it sounded like a fire alarms going off and that's exactly what they say it sounds like a fire alarms going off excuse us we'll just go go ahead and keep on keep him\nAnd then they went to a break and next thing you know they're out in front of a building on their cell phones\nBecause they had discovered an explosive device or something that looked like an explosive device at CNN headquarters there's everybody out\nWe're done\nNow you can say what you want about CNN you say what you want about any of the cable news networks or any of the talk news channels anything ... anything you say anything you want\nAh there's there's parts of this that make me roll my eyes\nAnd I'm not laughing at the thought that anyone would do that I mean that's the first thing I'd roll my eyes like a guest that we've reached a political fever that there's some one and I'm saying one at this point\nOut there that thinks the bombing people or pretending to bomb people or attempting to bomb people is okay\nWe've reached that level\nWhich brings me to the second thing that made me roll my eyes one of these packages was sent to Maxine Waters\nHave you don't know who Maxine Waters is if you don't remember who Maxine Waters is Maxine Waters is the Congress woman that has been screaming the Democrat out of California\nScreaming for all Democrats to get in the faces of Republicans do shout them and scream them out of restaurants\nGet in their face and make them uncomfortable take action she's basically calling for them to terrorize\nAnd here she is receiving one of these packages\n\nWas which was a suspicious package this was not a I I don't know it was not confirmed you as a sexually and exposed and vice versa temperature goes by or something that looks like it's supposed to advise\nSent to her\nHer quote I'm appreciative of law enforcement entities who intercepted the package and investigating the matter\nI unequivocal we condemn any and all acts of violence and tear really that's one of the things that made me Roma excusing it no rolling my eyes yes come on Maxine you would have been out screaming and hollering\nFor Democrats young people to get in the faces and essentially terrorize threaten\n\nAll Republicans\nAnd if you don't think they feel threatened how would you feel if you were sitting with your wife having dinner and somebody rose up snatch is your food for me started hollering at your yelling in your face\nKicked me out and then chase me to your car yeah that is not as scary as\nLet me start hollering at your yelling in your face kicked me out and then chase me to your car yeah that is not as scary as oh there's a bomb on my front porch\nBut its terrorizing them nonetheless Maxine Waters the victim that's just silly to me [laughter] ... waters the victim\nCNN here and this makes me scratching my head 'cause the CNN\nThing is it now understand CNN has been\nUnapologetically anti Trump I Would say anti anything conservative I mean from Kavanaugh to anything conservative in all the way up to Donald Trump president United States yes he's your press very sorry that was not my president William technically is yes you know\nThey've been running a yesterday all day it was Trump spreads lies in miss truths ahead of mid terms\nThey've taken the veil off they're not pretending by any stretch of imagination to support this president at all\n\nAnd incidentally I don't know what the alternative is\nReally okay fine he's the mean orange man in the White House I Know that that that humane he's ... he's awful it varies dean says mean things he's on Twitter he says mean things okay\nStock markets the stock market correction today that everyone's freaking out about six hundred and some odd points\nThat it still over twenty three thousand points it still crushing it I'm employment still historic lows\n\nSo CNN says that's we can't have any of that because there's a me man in the White House run and all this stuff\n[laughter]\nBut I'll tell you about CNN ratings in the tank they haven't seen ratings like this since the Malaysia flight\nAnd by the way if you really wind you go in the way back machine and you look at CNN prior to that flight there was no continuous breaking news role at the bottom\nThat happened during that Malaysia flight deal where they were running build a bell for days and they kept breaking news on there because they discovered when people are flipping through news channels they see breaking news uh stop\n\nIts good business and that's what they're running on the breaking news uh they're bringing new school at the bottom of the the screen yesterday was trumped pills President Trump spreads lies in Mr who's the head of ...\nThey have every single news outlet\nIncluding all of their competitors outside the CNN headquarters saying CNN CNN CNN CNN CNN was the last time there but CNN on cakes anti Vegas the CNN CNN all day CNN CNN CNN\nCNN is absolutely loving the fact that there were bombs placed all over all over the area and one of them just happened to show up in the newsroom there mailroom achieve\n\nOkay if I Want to talk like grownups so you're talking about grownups they are\nGetting there ain't nothing happened no one died and they can't buy this kind of publicity they're loving this\nThen comes me and you if we want to talk like like grownups and I and I do and I hope you want to talk of the drums to I don't want you to think\nAnd then comes me and you if we want to talk like like grownups and I and I do and I hope\nYou want to talk of grants to I don't want you to think that any time I talk about or or positively about a Democrat yo la la la la I'm not listening on those things mean Russ Michael's man\nOr things ... Republican ... either way if I say something you don't disagree with that is fine we're having a grownup conversation\nBut here's the elephant in the room that nobody's talking nobody is it we don't know the suspect\nThen I'm claiming won it might be a group of people there's there's one there's one news organization that's it's reporting and I know you want to give them credit for it until I have any kind of confirmation that actually looks at the CNN picture that they sent of the device that showed up to see in in ...\nIt looks like it just if you look at it if you squint really hard they're claiming it hasn't ISIS flag aren't then then I Would say it's a group but right now I'm saying the suspect person\nAll of us are hoping what did it doesn't look like us can we talk like drops\nDid it doesn't look like us I don't care if you are a Muslim you hope it doesn't look like you if you are just de da de ... me forty three year old white\nGuy over no we're going to me right in ...\nWe're all we're all on the edge of our seats until we see a picture of the suspect\nYou know we're\nThat's one of the things that made me roll my eyes not like a human being did this and this is unacceptable all of us over the place to look like me please please please please please\nPlease don't be a Republican or a Republican leader will be a Democrat what has he registered he or she what are they registered as I Hope it's not part of my group\nJust crazy more on this later let's get to this let's get to this caravan which apparently started as one guy just Donald head north and that was like fourteen thousand people oh we gotta talk like adults on this one Ross Michaels in for ... a forty kids in the\nAreas areas where you'll be haunted by the voices ... very very sad\nAnd they

talking about fourteen thousand people which estimates are so tough because people keep joining it\nIt's kind of a safety in numbers coming again\nSo we say fourteen thousand people there truly people in there that need help\nAnd unfortunately there are people that don't and people don't want to do harm when people that just want to get a ... it's just it's a it's a terrible thing there's just no there's no good way out and then who's leading the path who's navigating and if they're\nJust ... there's no good way at and then who's leading the path who's navigating\nAnd if they're if they're navigating they get to the U.S border what part of the U.S border do they get\nTo that's the key question where do they get to\nSo if they go knocking on the door of my home state Arizona there and it's not going to be a pretty sight if they want to go over to Texas it's going to be even uglier because they're going to pass\nThrough ... as far as this is a think tank up to tend to eleven murders a day\nIt's a it's a drug lord like strong the sooner lower cartel darn near owns the place and good luck passing through there and just waving high\nSo the only thing I can think that they would do if this isn't just a political stunt if this is truly them trying to get to the promised land and doing it on foot thousands of miles\nThey would go to the king of sanctuary states California and they would try to enter their but\nIf this is truly the political stunt that as being advertised by a lot of people they'll try do come right up to my home state they will try their best to come to Arizona and ... it's going to be a mess\nBecause of California wants to put their money where their mouth is they better start advertising calm one come all we'll protect you wear a sanctuary state we have

would do with them what do you do is fourteen thousand people showing up at one time\nRemember all of the uh the the cages does the Obama administration set up and everybody blamed a or a President Trump for it but this was all the Obama administration setting this up and they call them the holding attorney camps and they're talking about your kids being separated from their parents\nWhen you put them in there you put them in your house you open your doors\nI mean that's what I Would ask the Democrats I'd asked Maxine Waters first\nGo to Nancy Pelosi Dianne Feinstein\nAnd they ask you gonna put them you're going to put them up in your house\nSaying that Trump is being inhumane by saying that he's going to call the military to the border and protect our border and protect our nation

have some survival skills [laughter] let's be honest but evidence\nRubs 'cause you shipped to Alaska you will you better know how to hunt survive what a beautiful place ship them to Alaska this funny but the problem is\nI mean ... you you talk about the homeless or problems on the east coast in LA and New York and San Francisco you talk about their ... big homeless problem you know why they have such a homeless problem it isn't because of cost of living I'm sure that's a part of it is ...\n... but one of the reasons for that is because cities around the nation\nWanting to want to get rid of their homeless problem so you know what they do they buy them bus tickets you don't think this happens look it up it's been happening for years ship 'em off send them somewhere else get them out clean 'em up and they're they're\nAll landing in in these big sanctuary cities in LA and San Francisco and up in New York and they have this huge homeless problem\nBecause they they I don't think they started their the majority did not start there there were sent there\nIs a fourteen thousand people have to Alaska geez you could say Canada Canada adjacent but I Want to get out of the money if you want if you want to find out about ... if you want Mahler to actually work\nAnd do something instead of continuing to walk on about this Russia collusion with the Trump Administration which they have findings but it won't be released until after the midterms wink wink\nHow about you have the\nHis team started investigating where this money came from who's funding this who started this did someone place in Internet added to some places or a newspaper ad saying okay we're going to start this year's is find out who\nFind out the source of this\nAnd then I Would say the Trump Administration can then go with a a plan of attack and I wouldn't say attacking shooting is wrong with a plan of action or if they make it up to the border every country just keep shrug on their shoulders and turning a blind eye and let them pass on through\n'cause if you don't be getting into Mexico if you don't think the cartels are already involved and imbedded in there he crazy you come on down to Arizona with

we talk like grownups she still be Fox News had she not gotten to a little tit for tat with ah with then\nCandidate Donald Trump now President Trump during the primary\nNBC just grabbed her yeah let's get her she's conservative and now she hates Donald Trump we got a little unicorn\nAnd they pay every month to do and they gave her a show which is which flopped and then they gave her a new show which I guess as a little bit of traction remained Kelly why in the world without talking about making\nMaking Kelly made cheerful opposed she's very very sad she started her show\nWith I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry so she started show\nShe said you may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned into whether it has ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another\nBlack person making their face lighter or white or white person making their face darker black and I defended the idea\nShe went on to say I was wrong and I am sorry one of the great parts of sitting here in this chair each day is getting to discuss different points of view [noise] sometimes I talk sometimes I listening yesterday oh I learned I learned given the history of blackface being used an awful ways by racist in this country it's not okay\nTo be any part of any Halloween costume Halloween or otherwise look\nI Am not a PC person by any stretch of the imagination guy and I would not let my children go out the door in blackface I'm Sorry I just want that you just to me though\nWe do live in the United states by the way my one of my kids my son is going as a zombie unicorn yeah zombie in when you're that right and then my daughter's going as a pineapple I don't know where pineapples gain popularity these days but pineapple she's always upon\nAnd incidentally talking about Halloween costumes two thirds of parents two thirds are concerned about three things in this order least of the three\nIs their kids kids overeating and candy that used to be our number one concern number two is the safety of their children on Halloween Night\nAnd number one the number one concern above those two which should be their primary concern is their kids dressing too sexy scandal clad [noise]\n[laughter] well where this country ... home or going back to making Kelly and it's never OK to dress is a different race\n[noise] all this appropriation the nonsense\n[noise] I think times have changed\nAnd not have changed where it's all about what is just injustice just funny it's just you know it's no big deal if if you're offended you're you're a snowflake and you shouldn't be offended no I'm not not talking about that\nKind of change change the other way so why is it not okay for someone to dress as a different culture or race\nI've been a change the other way so why is it not okay for someone to dress as a different culture or race but I can identify if five so choose\nAs rose Michael's\nI could be I can identify as a woman if I Want to\nI can be Rachel Dole is all and I can be the head of the the chapter of the N. double ACP as a white woman that is dark into her skin to be a black woman in a in an identify as a black one\nWhen we have this this gender soup going on where you just get to pick you put your spoon in there and pick what you want to be\nAn culture soup Pocahontas who lives with Warren still claiming that she never claimed to be a Native American when she claimed to be a Native American several times and then took a test you can claim to be Native American talk about your high cheekbones\n\nI think that lessens the line of right and wrong\nWhen it comes to this case and making ... discussing now I understood why she had to do this because of the show is terrible\nI'm sure the NBC lawyers are trying to work out some sort of deal to get her off and paid off and just move on and away from the whole mess\nIf not there's dumb as I think they are\nBut she knows that she had to say this yet she kept saying I'm not a PC kind of person\n\nSo if I Can't identify maybe maybe it hey I wanted and then a fire after the show I I Want to say I'm a sixty five year old a male\nIdentify as an old man trust me my body feels like ... just a mile I I I I Want to go get the uh the the senior discounts for dinner what\nDo you think of that oh if if I Am living in that type of world where we can just self identify as anything we want\nAnd demand that everyone else except us for that\nI think it blurs the line of right or wrong and I
