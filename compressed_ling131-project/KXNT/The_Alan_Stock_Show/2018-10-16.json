he also was a pimp a legal pimp of legal Brussels or in Nevada and I know a lot of people will have issues about that\nUh two years of his administration and you're going to be able to talk about why it's important sent Dean Heller back to the Senate why it's important uh to elect Adam whack salt as the next governor of Nevada\nAnd you know what are the Adams an advantage welcome him here and we look forward to having him back here in our state once again is is um rallies always bring a lot of people out I I went into them before so\nYeah we we we love doing them because the president gets so much from them as much as people get from going to them he gets he gets his energy from those people and that is a tremendous thing to be able to watch and I've been doing these with them for years and it's really exciting\nInteresting he's coming Saturday because friday or not\nBetween I think it's the only debate between a Dean Heller and a Jacky Rosen a and it's going to be held a\nChannel eight here in Las Vegas I Will be a there is part of the day after debate analysis as a matter of fact so I'm looking forward to that and then he'll be here the next day you can give his own analysis I'm sure he will have a lot to say about as\nWell I think I think he will and Dean Heller is a fluke I disagreed with senator Heller over the years but he is a tremendous American somebody who serves a the the the people in Nevada\nAre very very well and then somebody who I think that people up to your state are going to return him to the United States Senate because he does the best job for his state at the same time supports the president\nBut let's the presidents hear his voice and the president listens to him and if you remember the last time you know the president and he didn't see eye to eye for a long time and now now they do and I think they respect each other and they and they have a great affection for each other and I'm I'm excited to see that relationship grow\nWill also Dean Heller is not taking any campaign money from Jane Fonda or J Street uh that's\nRight well wacky Jackie we'll take money for any ...\nUh and she has as a matter of fact and she has David boss he's joining us right now a president chairman of Citizens United and that was also the deputy campaign manager to the Trump presidential campaign\nI I Know that the Dow had gone down a little bit earlier last week and now I I just noticed a few moments ago the Dow has jumped more than five hundred points\nUh which has been an incredible what do you what do you attribute that to me as you get your finger on the pulse some of these economic things five hundred points in in his last day or so that's amazing\nWell I think what you're seeing is you're seeing the the the markets react to this strong economy in and out as we all know a heads up\nDays him down days but here but if you look at the last two years the market has taken off and they end up being a five hundred points today it makes back most of what it last last week when the fed ... injects itself\nUnfortunately into our ah economy in a in a negative way by trying to slow the economy and I think\nThat this is the there there this is the markets response by saying this is this is a a this is all good\nOf the end the markets are are going to continue to be strong you look at the GDP numbers you look at unemployment or you look at a a Hispanic unemployment African American unemployment ... women unemployment is the lowest in recorded history it's an amazing thing to watch what's going on so I'm excited about\nAbout this economy I'm excited for every American who wants to participate in this economy now has the opportunity look this reminds me of Reagan and ... and Ronald Reagan and Jack Kemp back in the Nineteen eighties when they used to talk about hope growth and opportunity\nFor all Americans and that's where we are today every American who now has the opportunity and they can look around and make it to see that their family has opportunities their brothers or sisters\nTheir children they have opportunities that they didn't have just two years ago that's what this president has brought back with his jobs jobs jobs bring back manufacturing from overseas bringing back\nA ... and creating a at a steel and aluminum manufacturing base in this country and creating a putting America number one in in the energy\nOf a surplus now we're ... we're delivering more energy oil and gas across around the world now than anybody else so he we change the way we do business\nUh and and I think our economy is his recognize that it is is a is rewarding every American\nAh for what Donald Trump has done for for this country over the last ...\nGot to ask you this also you saw the interview the president uh the big broadcast on sixty minutes on Sunday night Lesley Stahl\nUm I I don't remember I remember other presidents being interviewed by a sixty minutes many many times going back way way back but I Want to tell you\nI I don't remember a president ever being treated as this respectfully I interrupted as often as she did challenging him putting him down a and finally saying well you know I just\nI Know you're not going to have your way but I'm not going to argue with you and you know he finally let her know who is the president I my only criticize the criticism of the president is I Would have said we're a long before he did you know what just be quiet you asked that question let me answer don't be so disrespectful interrupt me I think she was disgusting\nShe knew it was terrible if you see what I'm up what prior presidents as you said\nA previous presidents they've done sixty minutes interviews and and the reporters are respectful they may not agree or or whatever with the with the answer but they don't know what I I Believe there was a couch she interrupted sixty four times different at interview it's crazy that this respect but at the main stream the his position\nThat is what they're doing um a too that's what they're doing a to this present day in and day out in the American people get it that's why he calls it the fake news that's why he is somebody who has\nDecided to fight\nBack he doesn't even what questions from Leslie stall questions from reporters on a daily basis at the White House he doesn't he just doesn't take anything from these reporters who doesn't allow them to lie in their questions and he doesn't feel forced to answer that question he answers the question that he thinks\nThat they're trying to ask in a sneaky way and it it it's it's like unlike he gives them a lesson and he really has given the Republican Party a backbone\nTo decide to fight back against what what he considers\nYou know an enemy which is ... ... it's not the media he doesn't believe the presses and then he believes fake news is the enemy of the people and that's that's a different thing and I think if he was treated uh honestly uh in with integrity\nThat the media would lose that would would win the battle against president would stop doing you\nKnow you're you know I I think you're very right I mean the Republican Party as it seems Republicans have not been as aggressive\nOr when it comes to fighting back a Democrats we know that they've been saying you know when you kick 'em and it'd be some uncivilized and and and getting people's faces in restaurants in a gas station we we we know what they say and Republicans\nAre remind me some times of the uh the British or you know marching through the the um the forests and the revolutionary war where where they just they they walk through all living picked off one of the time they and they have their their their chin and the air and they keep marching for a while to getting shot Republicans have not been in the past\nAs we have to get down in the gutter and we have to get down the gutter with them and fight and this president has been willing to do that and I think that is what has been a lot of an inspiration for other Republicans\nWithout question and that is change the dynamic\nThe mainstream media is a you know believability factor with the American people is way down and it should be because there is honest about this president they were dishonest during the entire two thousand sixteen camping and they've been dishonest during his presidency and he's just sick and tired of it and so he continues to battle with him and he takes his message\nDirectly to the American people there were these rallies like you're going to be doing\nI ... outside is it outside arena like they um are you know on Saturday Night and ... and then at rallies across the country\nTwitter using using Twitter to talk directly to the American people because the press has to report what he writes on Twitter and it drives me crazy but it it it his way of defeating\nNo absolutely the case David moss we'd be within by the way\nI I I Am not going to agree I was with them last month when we were out there but not this time but I Know all I have a great time and everybody is going to have a wonderful time with ...\nDavid boss the president and chairman of the Citizens United the twenty sixteen a deputy

sticking their shoes off cameras caught off camera but she'll say things they have that she's saying she does not want voters to know about\n\nNot getting things she does not want voters to know about because it might hurt her ability to get elected might compromise through with moderate voters and so she comes out and says some things and it's caught on tape\nSome people think that shouldn't be doing that and the other hand you know\nAs I said do a boss you a few moments ago is that Democrats have been playing dirty completely dirty for a long time and it's time that Republicans fought back Donald Trump is certainly given the impetus for Republicans to get on board\nWith you know the old saying you bring a knife to a fight or bring a gun\nYou know that kind of thing right you bring a gun I'll bring a bomb I mean you've heard those kinds of things before you think that they're terrible it's time the Republicans fought back against these claims by Democrats\nAnd may have been dirty
