M. V. admitted to date admitted they were wrongly registered to vote between late April in late September\nAnd it included other non citizens all this in addition in addition to the roughly twenty three files and registration mistakes disclosed by the DMV last month\nSo um he said his attempt to get a replacement driver's license at a DMV field office late August ended with him being registered as sent a registered voter notice by election officials DMV say errors were blamed on employees making data injuries\nOkay so here's the deal anywhere they intentional or not I don't have any idea I have no idea but here's the problem we have\nDifficulties even in this state with people who are registered who should not be we we ... we know that we've had people who voted multiple times\nAnd again these are the heirs by employees I I get it but nonetheless people have voted multiple times people are registered who should not be here in this state as well as California I don't think our problem is quite as big as California but nonetheless it exists here too\nAnd\nWe have a way of fixing this problem by the way I Believe we do\nAnd I suggested for a long long long\nTime that we get 'em voter id where everybody has to show a voter id and show who you are when you go to vote and you can see that they are in fact they say they are\nInstead with the left has done is they've tried to make it a lot easier to be able to register to vote\nAnd they in many ways are trying to ...\nAnd in doing so we may wind up with some of the huge problems that California is facing right now is that that's why I mentioned this deal right now and what did you know exactly what's happening in California\nBefore you understand why we should absolutely oppose question five on the upcoming battle it is for automatic voter registration\nAnd I would say about that in just a few moments because I just don't think this is the way to go you have enough problems as it certainly is we don't need to add to it by\nHaving people automatically rents are like they do in California\nThey're experiencing as I mentioned them first they've had this problem we don't need emulate that All right all that and more coming up in a few moments we'll take your calls well seven three three kids into seven three three five nine six eight I'm Alan stock and this is Kate ex ante\nStarting it then many von der ...

Europe at the time\nAnd um came this country wanted but something better for himself and and he found is here\nBut right now is this an automatic voter registration here's the problem right now uh you have to be a pro active or to go ahead and a registered to vote\nMeans you have to actually make a point of of wanting to and then a negotiating that registration ... automatically to devote it's not automatic you you you have to make a point of wanting to register to vote\nThis change this automatic voter registration would change this way if you go down to change your address or get a new driver's license whatever it is\nInstead of choosing to register to vote instead it would reverse it where you're automatically registered to vote unless you opt out\nIf you don't opt out you're automatically be registered as a nonpartisan all these and change parties later\nRight\nNow supporters of this are saying it'll eliminate a barrier to voting and expand voter rolls\n\nAnd I'm telling you right now it's not up to the state to decide whether or not you should vote it's up to you number one number two when opponent supporters of the state eliminates a barrier to voting\nAnd expands voter rolls me say two things about that one it will not eliminate any barriers to voting that's an absolute lie\nIts ally\nThere is no barrier to registering to vote right now if you are a person that should be registered to vote there's no Barry go down and you register right now today they're closed at eight mile register to vote if we haven't registered yet you want to register and you're a citizen register\n\nWhen they say it will expand voter rolls they're right and what they want to do I believe is get as many folks registered as possible whether they should be registered or not just like in California\nSo they can get as many folks they would hope would register and vote their way by appealing to a certain low common denominator Z\n\nSupporters say would eliminate a barrier to voting it's an absolute lie because there is no barrier right now devoting if you are a citizen\n\nIf you don't have documentation that you're a citizen you're that you were born when they didn't have birth certificates you that old they are very\nVery very few people if any that fit into that category very few people if any would fit into that category and I'm sure those half a dozen people or fewer that may exist in the state Nevada I'm sure it's fewer than that\nTo find a way to work with the government to get themselves register if they haven't done is already so if you're Ninety five Ninety six and you haven't registered ready and you don't have any documentation to prove that were you when you were born I Would ask white and register earlier\nBut if you really want to register to Ninety five Ninety six I'm sure that will find a way to help you out not many people will fit into that category by the way\nSo that's why this is a bunch of malarkey there is no barriers to voting show me who's been denied who should be able to register to vote show me that they were denied show that to me\nYou you and I both know that its ally ... absolute lie bill your I Can't send gee welcome to the show\nA Allen I thank you for bringing this to our attention and I would only hope uh that between now and election day that you continue to mention is a very articulate to make people aware and I I Would I Would suggest\nAh that that last caller uh that you would have suggested that he may be contact Michael McDonald or uh some of the people in the Republican Party at the top echelon to make them aware of some of these things so that they could possibly follow up on it and ah and ah as stop this\nWell I Would um I Would hope that um I haven't seen a lot of ads are against it at this point I've seen some ads forward by the way I haven't seen a lot I guess I Would hope that the Republican Party and those were\nWould be putting more ads out like this and you're right I mean I Will be talking about this a lot between now and the months from now when you was your hat or\nYou had a perfect person or that you could have put in touch with the Republican Party to follow through with the uh you know hard or a evidence that this this is happening\nNow they but they know but they know this and I just said that in California and I'm a sales were they have automatic

P. envy dot com slash\nMedicare okay I'll give you want me to outside all of this but only for a moment up this is on bringing this up for a reason you know the news cycle I'm Brett Kavanaugh's kind of gone flashing okay ... ... it has I'm just saying it and the reason I brought that up is because\nCNN has returned to talking about the president's previous again\nI I'm just saying that's what they're doing\nCNN's host Don Lemon\nWho was a ... hours a lemon could be he hosted a stormy uh yesterday talking about her book and he brought up how she described the president's private party\nThat's the one any fender bender I I'd say yesterday how she said she had regrets about about having just described it he so lemon says you\n... author of a racing America and that's genes Robbins or to help guide us through this um the asthma seer ... thanks so much for being with us I Do appreciate it you know\nYeah I'm here oh wait a face so much for being with us after she hated oh my pleasure thank you\nOh okay so um we've got a I I Know you're writing your book about about\nAmerica going nuts and and and the left destroying it ... when we do have this whole issue is not about trying to get along anymore it's tried to destroy anything they became a conservative stand for\n[noise] yeah you know it's unfortunate because uh our system was founded on compromise I mean the constitution in shrines compromise decorum these kinds of things\nNow when we see people clawing at the Supreme Court or shrieking in the Senate gallery ah people like Maxine Waters and now I guess Hillary Clinton recommending that people and not be civil or get up in people's faces and stuff like this are you really can't have a functioning republic when people are behaving like that\nI mean is that how it I mean how do we function and I mean I I again I I have had people who have said to me during the last election and sixty and they said we can't people I've known for all my life\nSince I was a little kid we can't talk anymore because I'm afraid what I'm going to say they were saying this to me they're ... they're going to say something horrible to me because we disagreed on on you know the the president they were for Hillary and I was for Trump and and they couldn't even talk\nI mean this was wouldn't beyond even being able to have a civil discussion\nWell part of it is that the political culture has normalized the notion that if anyone has offended that that somehow a crime or if someone says something you don't like than any response is appropriate\nAnd I mean that's really the root of it if you have people say well I Can't talk to you because it will trigger me\nYeah well you know why not practiced in self control I mean what happened to those old\nVirtues or you know being able to control your emotions and being able to have a civil discussion it seems like the left in particular has said hey anything goes if someone says something you don't like than just start calling them names and freak out\nYou know I was reading about your book and I know you're talking there about the\nThe outcome people wanting to get rid of a a John ... Calhoun a you know because of a during the slavery Aaron and other get rid of to kill a mocking bird and an anti racist book by the way to get rid of that as well\nUh all these outcomes that are not very good and then I I happen to see\nThis piece that Robert Redford\nPut out on his website uh and he says in their ... among other things\nUm we don't have to share the same motivations to want the same outcomes but the problem is as you point out in your book the problem is we don't even share the same outcomes whether they're looking for and the left is a socialist society I Am not\nOh for sure and it's become much more evident lately particularly with their defeat in the Senate on the ah the Kavanaugh a Supreme Court nomination now we're hearing that the Senate isn't democratic\nWell die the Senate was never meant to be democratic it was meant to represent the states that was the whole point of it the you know great compromise that James Madison put together\nSo now if they're attacking the fundamentals of the constitution and how it works then yeah that's a much\nIt's debate and simply saying you know what what level of welfare spending do we want in our budget I mean they're attacking the root of our constitutional system\nYou know saying revise the Supreme Court at a whole lot more injustices get rid of the electoral college it seems like anything that the left can't win on they just want to trash it and then force him to play something that works for them\nYou know by the way they're speaking of the electoral college there was a time when Obama was president and the Democrats control both the house and the Senate nobody ever talks about getting rid of the electoral college I just want to mention that that was never mentioned\nRight well you know usually the things that they want to change the things that they haven't figured out how to make work for them I mean I don't hear you know Republicans or you know original list or constitutional is talking about radical changes just because they lost a vote\nSo let me ask somebody I mean I Know you're right about us some uh a lot of about the\nUh the with the outcome would they would like to have socialist country and getting rid of you know we were doing our history and everything will be talking about Winston Churchill in a little bit too because that he's in the news they believe it or not but all this going on how do you see as a person who studied all this year a journalist\nI how do you see us being able to uh put hunting dumped the back together again or put the country back together again or are we not can never have have that happen\n[noise] well it's difficult I I think we have to have a discussion about values like we mentioned before about you know decorum and just the principles of getting along getting along for its own sake\nIt strikes me that on the left they really don't value that anymore they've completely abandoned out on so maybe that's a good discussion to have also not feeling shame about the country because the whole victim culture that's popular on the progressive side it\nIs meant to inculcate a sense of shame or for the you know the victimized is which is\nApparently everybody who's not a progressive and we have to stop doing that people should be able to feel pride in their country\nPride in their family history and what they've achieved without being accused of you know having white privilege or you know saying the founding fathers were all evil things like this so really I think correcting this historical revision ism that's gone on for the last thirty or forty years that's a good starting point\nI appreciate the ... by the way I'm Talking with James Robbins author of racing America but I I've got to say this you're very logical and you know very well thought out and and I talked to conservatives who are very well thought out and logical\nBut the problem is is that the left is not the Maxine Waters and now as I mentioned Hillary coming out today and and\nOur yesterday coming out and and basically reiterating with Maxine Waters said you had a a kid who worked for a few of Jackson or who was actually putting out the home addresses of Republican senators\nI mean ... ... ... you want comedy member CEO MIT why you want people to get along and have these discussions and the other side is saying go to hell I mean that's what's going on\nAnd you're absolutely right and by the way that kid who docks the senators is going to go to jail which is great\nI'm sure that yeah definitely it you're right it's hard for people who are basically you know want to have a calm rational discussion to deal with people who not only are hyper emotional but uphold that has value you\nKnow say that that's a perfectly legitimate way of going about things it is very difficult but the problem is and maybe even the left can understand this is a normal life and that kind of ...\nWell for them it will be normal for everybody and their extremists on all sides of the equation so what happens when other types of extremist show out what happens when these people are clashing in the streets\nAnd we've seen some of this going on in Portland for example what happens when that becomes commonplace is that really the America that we want to live in\nCertainly don't and the more that the other side ratcheting up this notion that was a more of this we're going to see and it's not helping them at the ballot box maybe what they need to do is reexamine their priorities and come up with policies and approaches that American voters are interested in\nThan just assuming that they're right everyone else's stupid and anything goes\nBy the way the Portland thing you mentioned the real quickly I got a lot of time to the port in the situation that that was the ... off I'm not mistaken were they were industries tried the direct traffic and a threatening people and the police\nStood by and watched this happened and they did nothing at all I'm ... you're more optimistic than I Am I've got children grandchildren by the way and I want this country to be you know back to some semblance of what it was as I was growing up\nBut uh these days with all these things going on and the attention I I just I\nI I'm not as optimistic as you are but I Want to encourage everyone to check the book out it's called the race in America is losing our future\nBy destroying our past by James Robbins I thank you so much for joining us after that I really do appreciate it and perhaps we'll do it again\nOh thank you my pleasure\nAll right take good care of James Robbins is joining us right here in ... three ... three three five and six you tell me how we got this country back together again oh Winston Churchill ...

of an investigation that was conducted in the mind\nIs um you know the Republicans already with President Trump on down a want a comparison nation welcoming and\nSo she and bottom line is what she

Ferris published the blog for raising the race conscious children's ... else a and Halloween about why she wouldn't let her white daughter dress up as little water\nShe goes on to say Milan is based on real history and a real group of people were going to dress up a real person or a real person we have to make sure we are doing it in a way that it's respect for otherwise it is like we're making fun of someone else's culture seriously\n\nShe goes on to stabilize culture is not our culture yeah\nAnother person writes a discouragement of cultural appropriation seems to assume very negative motives perhaps dressing up as someone from another culture is motivated by a desire to are you ready for this one on or that culture honor that culture\n\nI mean there are people who have a you know ideas on both sides I like the one that says this let kids be is I'm Sorry the why is it offensive for anyone to dress up as mulatto she's a Disney\nA as a little boy or girl wants to dress up as the favorite Disney Princess and they should be made to feel like they're in the wrong\nAnd the other person says um is is absurd I'm a firm believer in respecting culture giving the proper appropriation but we do not need to be in a world where our kids' imaginations can't flourish\nAnd finally someone does write this cultural appropriation stuff is getting out of hand and that is so true that is so true so seven three three cats and two seven three three five nine six eight if you're\nGetting Halloween costume street for your kids do you consider the fact that those costumes light be representing someone from another culture ethnicity race\nI mean does any of that into your mind or your kids get jazz by the idea that they can dress like the black panther or Milan or because they were popular characters\nIn the movies and the comics and kids just want to be kids and play and have fun and let their imagination run wild\n\nSeven three three key accent the seven three three five

confused because I don't understand what race do you have to be if you want to dress up as a zombie 'cause I'm not I'm not really sure where that that and I think it's absolutely ridiculous that the

it and you know he was he was found not guilty so you know he\nWas convicted of other things that he's a felon ... that's absolutely correct the whole thing goes back to them talking about the whole point why the whole point is that would you have your kids wear a mask of a person who is a a convicted felon and I don't care whether it's black like Cosby or white like Manson who cares\n\nNo kid them I Would ever want any of those kinds of masks I guarantee you will be Michael Meyers is okay\nMichael Meyers or the the slasher ... that's ... see that's another mask I mean that's another stupid
