many many years and she remembers the fire that occurred at the uh MGM grand and uh Seventy some odd people I think Seventy eight people with not maybe less than the fear and that was about that number died\nIn that fire so it was a huge tragedy and how this how this community came together for that\nWe came together I recall I Know you do for nine eleven uh we were stranded here and how that worked out so she said you know I mean the idea was that I mean we become strong but you know we've been strong for other tragedies that have occurred as well as going to ask you\nWhat do you think

everything else that has to be\nSo the funding that you and the sheriff ... started as race am I correct thirty two million dollars is that correct\nThirty million dollars yeah drinking million\nWow a big uh kudos into the hat to you and the sheriff for for an issue you guys initiated others have contributed obviously but you guys in the audience was\nWe got ... record around Ninety individual

Bryce Harper her uh they they had it on a\nA they're a Twitter handles its cold across the bottom of the things during the playoff games and the raiders got it on the bottom for the uh NFL\nGames and

that\nI play with my county commission chairman Steve to select a along with the Sheriff Joe Lombardo initiated the funds which now we find out is actually reach thirty two million dollars incredible amount of money I've got to ask you a ... well when will these funds be distributed and how will they go about distributing these funds\nWould they did distributed we we turned it over to commit pointed a committee of community leaders that\nTook input from the um the various individuals that are wanting to give it I mean we couldn't give money to everybody so they had\nIt was you know fifty eight deceased and I think it was the other four five that were permanently um your brain damage so they got a share a I mean that was close to twenty million Fifteen twenty million of it went there and then the other\nVarying degrees of injuries got the rats so they were all distributed checks all run out and uh people at least able to catch up on some bills\nI got to ask you this also because I Know you're in touch with the various resorts yourself and somebody called early and said they want I mean it it really you have if they made an effort to be able to uh make sure that things are safe

resorts and\nHave you noticed a a talking these folks that there's been a significant reinforcement least behind the scene I've seen a reef reinforcement of security\nThere is absolutely it we've all learned a lot uh some things you see for example you know the the other when we got to figure boulevard I mean most of the white alliance Vegas boulevard to protect protest at all well there's a lot

making progress I don't think you're ever going to make it a completely a hundred percent\nImpenetrable Allen frankly because this is a terrorist act you got one individual that just you know and I know it's very frustrating for the sheriff and the FBI to to not be able to nail down exactly what the cause of this or what the motive laws and um and I don't think we ever well frankly having they've searched and done everything possible or\nBackground and haven't come up with a a a cause that we can and the sun\nAlright also by the way he sees his lack in commissioners Susan regular

Kate Snow\nReally did you you really did I get Kavanaugh's really denied the allegations denied even knowing shrimp Nick does even though our\nYou know a ... her lawyer she's his lawyer for a stormy because well a is a she'd be represented by having a ...\nShe said that the parties Kavanaugh is very aggressive very sloppy drug very mean drunk\nNBC News noted there were differences in ... initial statements and her comments to the outlet notably her assertion that cabinet spite parts of the parties so that groups of boys could raped girls shutting it did not confirm\nOr that she saw cabinet ever spike punch which simply says she saw him around the punch containers\nOh well that'll do it you know I mean it was getting a glass of punch it should never be on the Supreme Court pockets rebar justice drink punch [noise]\nWell see putting into that punch I'm I mean I heard that but I'm not sure what that was [noise] yeah [noise] ah no no I I [noise] I was an open Mike maybe that was not good that I got\nAll right um she said the NBC suspend the I don't know what he did [noise]\n\nThat but she also appeared to backtrack on a suggestion that Kavanaugh is evolving gang rapes but she does she said he was that she says she only sign congregated with other boys outside of rooms\nSo she didn't doesn't really know\nShe said her assault happened at a party at the hands of multiple boys after her drink with spite she didn't know of cabinet and judge participate in a rape there at the party near her when she began to feel sick\nUm\nNBC did try I talked to her about lawsuits being filed against him by former employers restraining order followed by an ex boyfriend to talking about\nThat stuff and um they did check out for names that she provided to envy NBC NBC again right we're talking about you know a left wing embassy\nOne said they did not remember ... at all to ... one was dead so they couldn't respond and to did not respond\nRight [noise]\nSo she's got a history of legal problems and extensive a history of legal problems\nAn extra player accused her of falsifying or college and work history on a job application with him about a minute a legal documents from Maryland Oregon Florida provide a partial picture of a woman who stepped in the media glare or\nMiss this whole thing she's been involved in at least six legal cases over the past twenty five years lawsuit filed by former employer in November two thousand plus personal injury sushi filed in Ninety four against the D.C regional transit authority\nAnd uh I'm an IT her lawyer and storm his lawyer right he released a statement saying she witnessed cabinet and this is again this the initial witness before she backpedaled on NBC she witnessed cabinet consistently engaging excessive drinking in inappropriate contact a sexual nature with women in the early Nineteen eighties\nAll right hey\nI'm One that person has said I'm a\nNationally recognized advocate rape survivors says many sexual do survivors in concert chaos in trouble later in life things can tarnished the survivors image but don't necessarily speak to the legitimacy of the underlying abuse allegations\nI don't disagree with that but if you make an accusation you ought to be able to back it up that's all try to back it up\nAllegations I don't disagree with that but if you make an accusation you ought to be able to back it up\nThat's all trying to back it up\nA avid out he did say that a ... thoroughly enjoy embarrassing Republicans ... ... did you Sherry committee she was thoroughly enjoy she'd get she'd get a real rise out of\nIt ... and and emotional orgasm ... the and they were talking about [noise] um\nOne company she was an employer for a few weeks before it's human resources department received a

had provided false information on her employment application and listen to this very closely very important\nThat says you misrepresented the length of time she worked at the previous employer and falsely claim that she'd earned an undergraduate degree degree in biology and chemistry from Johns Hopkins university now her lawyer Mr brilliant ... the sleeves bucket yeah he said whether\nShe is a college degree or not does not matter as to whether she was a sexual assault victims you're you're you're right ... you're absolutely right except for one thing\nThis does prove that she's a liar\nAnd if she's going to lie about some of this what else does she like how do you take your word for this when she lied saying that she went to this uh college got this this stuff are these degrees worked and the previous employ all this is a lie [noise]\nYes big time by the way her aunt told a pie that are nice went off to college but quickly moved back home so she didn't go to these cause she doesn't have these degrees she's a phony she's a faces a liar ... says what does it matter if she's a liar as long as she was telling us now something that Republicans will hate\nMe get the idea I mean okay you're getting the idea they have\nSearched and they've searched high and low\nTo find that people who can substantiate the claims of these three women some as I mentioned you last week have been some of these complaints have been withdrawn because\nThey know people know that there lies the guy in Rhode Island just said he saw cabinet and mark judge you know a raped women and then soon as as it was

a bullet or whatever the cases right\nI'm Sorry but that's Republicans do\nThey march march and they got to be picked off one by one they go what we're going to keep our head above the fray we're not going to get down into the dirt we're not going to act bad like those people that's what they're that's what they do\n\nAnd what ticks me off of frightens me is that\n\nUh if we lose this because Republicans have no sense of being able to scrap\nAnd they have to be willing to put two boxers\nIn a ring until one of them act classy and just stand there and take the hits how long is he going to
