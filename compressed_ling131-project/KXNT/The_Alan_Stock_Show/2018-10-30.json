Pittsburgh I he's the president is welcome any time you know like it right here you know go back and cry I'm\nI'm president yes they're not that's just as a ...\nPercent drew the irony is the uh the rabbi who is in charge of the synagogue where the shooting occurred said he is our president and he's always welcome here and I think that was righteous of him to say that I Do think that was the right way to go\nThey want him to do that as a white nationals which he has done already white supremacy and because the president said he felt like a national she's about a week and a half ago and in an interview they felt that he was referring to white nationalism ... they put words in his mouth\nThree nights you had a case that you're going to go after the great to have you with us You're trying

and took care of him\nAnd um this the president of the ... um hospital says we're here to take care of six people were not here to judge you were not here to ask do you have insurance or do you not

know ... how are you doing was he in pain you said no he was fine\nAnd then the shooter asked him who he was and he said I'm Dr Cohen president of the hospital and they turned around he left\nAn FBI agent who was guarding him said I don't know if I could have done that and I said if you were in my shirt shoes I'm sure you good [noise]\nYeah I I just wanted to say I I certainly respect Dr ... I really do but I I feel kind of like the FBI age I'm not sure I could have done that I mean you know and have been very hard\nAnd not as magnanimous I I'm not and I and I admit that right off the bat I'm telling you this is uh\n\nI'm telling you this is a it's it's bizarre stuff to the president's is down in the eighties in Pittsburgh are offering condolences\n\nPutting a a a flower and the stone

down to the ... the whole a\nRow of the of the Jewish stars placing ... or so it's a Jewish tradition when you visit someone's grave sites or the resting places some guy whatever happens to be you put a stone there some people bring flowers but the tradition as you bring a stone and that's where the president did each one of these\n\nCalls have been nice had the people in Pittsburgh I was talking about the ... the average person there would have had a little more consideration local national officials declined to appear with the president in Pittsburgh set\nA majority leader Mitch McConnell house Speaker Paul Ryan Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and house minority leader Nancy frozen face Pelosi all invited to a joined the president\nWe were not planning to take part in the visit McConnell and Ryan both sides scheduling conflicts yeah Senator Pat Toomey a Republican was if I joined the president but he declined democratic Senator Bob Casey was not even invited by the White House\nAnd a spate of local and state officials also said they would not appear with Trump when he visited the hospital today to pay respect\n\nIt's just a just amazing the Pittsburgh mayor build a ... said the or the president should force ball a visit while burials began and he would not appear with the president is well All right right here\nOnce again let me just say rabbi Jeffrey Myers

cancer teeth welcome to the show surf\nThink yeah I Know that you're always good thank you sir I I Would say that I think the president whether they can or cannot I don't even think that really matters I think he should make an executive order a prank or babies and and I'll tell you my reasoning\nSo if he does that it's going to go through the courts\nIt wins he's in good shape yup but at the sea horses that Congress and the Senate to act because as this\nComes up more people are going to get involved and they're going to want to know why their constituents on the Republican side are are not back in the president I think that's going to do with the tax cut and a few other things that he did that we're having a problem I think he's going to force the house in the Senate\nTo actually act upon it and if we've got I think we I'm Democrat but I mean that the Republicans got the numbers than they can then they could change it and I don't see why they can't\nYou know what's interesting is that um the lives will tell you that can interpret a in men men's as they want to interpret them an example I'm the first amendment freedom of speech that's great\nBut shouldn't include hate speech right or but on the other hand you have this amendment that was initiated in order to provide 'em recognize citizenship a former slaves after the civil war but here we should uh ... instead of being narrow interpretation\nLike they wanted to the first amendment they want to expand it let's include now illegal aliens who come here and give birth to a child\nSo I mean uh you know I think you're right I think the president ought to do it as well and I know in force that would force people to take a look at this fourteenth amendment and and and determine whether or not this is what it was really meant and have the courts and make a decision on the fourteenth amendment\nOr ... and do it in a in a timely manner I agree with you I like to see him do it as well it would force that debate\nAnd you know what else I think it would also forced as well is since since she was willing to give so much to the ANC I mean I agree with the um\nThe uh the dreamers and he was willing to give more than what they were asking for all this can end up being bundle and fish now now you and I as regular people we know that\nThat they don't want to really fix this problem because the Democrats are getting the votes on the one side you know and the Republicans might be hoping for votes on the outer correct but as regular American citizens\nWe want it fixed and if they put you on the table and forces them\nTo do that I think the president could still get the dreamers what he wanted to give as an American citizen\nBut ... it's kind of like a this is what we're going to do and then after that it it all stops then I think people can get on board with that and then might actually be beneficial I'm not going to say beneficial but beneficial in arguing for the both sides when they go well we want we want this this is what will get can be come together\nThey might say yeah I mean you you got to give it a shot you you can't lose nothing if you don't try\nI my friend I'm with you a thousand percent on this one I appreciate your call and your common sense this afternoon you know interestingly enough President Reagan allowed for a lot of illegals to be given a waivers and they became citizens and people said it should never happen\nYou know interestingly enough President Reagan allowed for a lot of illegals to be given a waivers and they became citizens and people said it should never happen again it's happening now and um we can't keep doing this every thirty forty years cannot keep doing it\nSo things have got to be able to change and ah and we've got to take his strong stance that you know if you are an illegal alien if you did not if you're not a I'm a citizen here you're not here legally with a green card you weren't vetted you just popped across the river and said I'm here\nAre you expected that we have to okay well then if you're here we've got to do whatever you say\nWe've got to be able to make sure that that this does not happen again on and on and on it it is time and when people say like there in Pittsburgh with signs well you know they're pro immigrant well we're all pro immigrant when it's done illegally in the right way\nBut a good half the country plus two thirds of the country or against illegal immigrants illegal aliens people who have broken the law to come here huge huge huge difference [noise]\nExactly when you do things the right
