Jason life and my friend of ours a nationally published writer a long time fan of flip the strip as they say longtime fan of your\nFirst time caller so ah yeah let's let's talk about right up to bat so Jason used to work for a moment of her making seven he's also written for Vegas magazine Las Vegas weekly magazine he's also a former ah television newsroom manager Bruce or he sounds very qualified just makes me wonder why even doing our little show\nI finally made it on the show is that I Would I've been wanting to come on since day I was standing outside the building if anybody from where I live you know where that guy if you'd steamy yeah that was me that was you and I just\nThink he's now looming on the college radio show which apparently everyone had but me said Jason what did you tackle and I was a little hard hitting me\nAbout tell you what it was it was ground breaking it was it was like a like to Howard Stern show because nobody was doing that on college radio and then I met you know there are no how Howard in a\nHoward Stern not news show is just another\nThose terrible problems so Jason so earlier this week uh you had a really big story that ran the Hollywood Reporter so obviously you know like I say people he's a nasty published writer as well but tell us about that story made it kind of made some waves a little bit\nWell uh yeah so as you mentioned yet occasionally I'll get a chance to write something for the Hollywood Reporter and ah this past\nPorter and ah this past weekend I was in Pasadena, California I was there at the Halloween forty years of terror convention Halloween movie franchise is something that I'm very passionate about and while\nWe were there I was sitting in a one of the panels and a gentleman got up to speak\nLet me remind real quick if you had read some headlines over the summer from San Diego Comic Con you would've I'm seeing that the the Halloween panel their Jamie Lee Curtis was there and the guy got up to speak in the audience\nAnd he told a story about a he was a victim of a home invasion and the only thing he could think of in his mind was what would Laurie stroke due lawyer throws the name of Jim ... character in the house\nAnd um he grabbed her knitting needles just like her character he got a lot of house just like her character um\nHe was very moved in the audience I started to cry Jimmy the critics Scott down from the stage went into the crowd gave him a big hug\nOr it picked up you know in all the national international media\nOr he actually wasn't identified at the time he was missed identified in a couple of articles that I've read about this guy was at the convention where I was over the weekend he got up to speak at the beginning of a Q A session for the panel\nFor the original Halloween movie Nineteen Seventy eight Jimmy Carter was not there but some of the original stars where there are the men and played Michael Meyers was there\nA he took the Mike\nHe told his story a little bit more and a very emotional or at one point he's but thank God you guys made this movie because I'm Alive today\nAnd he talked about being a trauma victims and just not being able to overcome what had happened to him and this was\nDecades ago was Nineteen eighty two\nAnd so afterwards we spoke in the hallway\nHis experience meeting Jimmy Curtis really\nOr was cathartic for him and uh he says now that he really wants to dedicate has time to\nMeeting people who suffered similar trauma and we're having a very hard time dealing with it especially speaking you bring it out of them so his problem was he had cut to bottle up inside for so many years that it was eating away at him he's in therapy has therapist said you've got something on your chest you've got to get it off\nSo he's trying to do is go around and speak to he's been trying to speak to men and it's not that he's he's not being the drum single men are victims to uh he's just saying you know men have a harder time\nOpening up about bad things that happened to him because they don't want to be labeled as you know emotional are insecure or less masculine\nAnd so but he opened up to you though another man he did he had no problem opening up he was very very sweet guy I I definitely felt bad about his story but I really felt good about what he's doing\nGoing out there and and trying to find people he says that he's been to conventions he's met fans that have come up to him and said I've had a terrible thing happened to me and we're talking about things that are much worse than a home invasion have you spoken up since the story ran I did I spoke to him last night two nights ago on the phone okay ah how do you feel about he was\nHe felt very good he was not ashamed at all to have a story out there he was not a\nHe was just not ashamed to be heard and what he was hoping from the story was that he would meet more people are or more people will just come forward with their own stories to somebody else or if you talk to somebody it really helps to kind of overcome a tragedy or trauma\nIt's always a hard thing to write a story right and you always wonder what the person thought of the story it was kinda worried they're going to not like it right\nYeah and a lot of times you really don't even get any feedback and to see them I always ask them and I know you're not\nSupposed to do that at all did you like the story I don't know why I Do that but you know I'm I mean I'm not writing is most of the time so it's usually things that people would enjoy about themselves or whatever and then I'm always surprised to see what the reaction is sometimes they're like oh I loved it and you can tell they were didn't love it\nAnd it's mostly ... sold out and it's always it's always a photo sex\nBut the reaction is sometimes they're like oh I loved it and you can tell they were didn't love it um it's mostly also too I find the photo and it's always it's always a photo extent women don't I mean what did you think a really bad for me and I saw this so much is an editor with women really don't like most pictures that themselves and that kind of made me sad\nYeah now women are very very harsh credits that there aren't that as my uh my girlfriend's cousin is one of the um top guys for ESPN as far as one of the honor announcers\nAnd when he got married a few years ago when I wrote a story for people magazine go see what he's an honor talent ... people knew him and his now wife was so thrilled with the story not because of the story said necessarily but because of the photo ...\nSo it's so funny you mention that because women are all about the photo all about the picture on it to the genes and what are some other stories that you've written recently that you're really crazy about\nOh gosh kind of put me on the spot here um\nHe changes do at Halloween read view if you want to go down there all yeah\nYeah I did send you to take off our takeover on Halloween\nWell you know we had a radio show he knows what he's doing for the than Melinda asked me if I Would uh go to the Halloween on Tuesday night at a previous screening at red rock and I did one thing though that um was actually my second time seen it I did see it last friday night and I'd be I'd be screening for some convention goers\nSo but that was a midnight screening I'm usually not awake at that time uh and I've been traveling so I wasn't really able to absorb it the way I was on Tuesday night got out of the screening came home wrote my review and said I just boil it\nYeah go ahead and ... let's talk about Halloween the movie obviously we're leading up in the weeks Halloween Jason you are Halloween officially an auto that's a good way both in the sense of the holiday and then also the film\nRight or the Halloween series I have loved ah for most of my life since seen I didn't even see the first one first I saw the second one first son was first movie I saw from the serious but I Love them all\nAnd I was very very excited to um to get to see this new one it's pretty remarkable it's probably the best of the sequels that they put out its most certainly\nThe best people they've had in the last Twenty years it's remarkable the thing about that we're talking about forty years this whole series and I know mark you'd ask me how many films are unnecessary right eleven so many yeah now do we did we need an eleventh I think we did\nI think we did talk about one of the things that I noticed about Halloween is it kind of root it re boots self every ten years in a way um\nAnd it does that kind of ... in accordance with the culture that we're in Seoul just really quickly if you go all the way back to Nineteen eighty eight which would've been the first ten years\nOr they were in the middle of a big flash her crazy friday and chase and things like that it really fit in with that\nOr ten years later we were in a big phase with scream and a and Williamson who wrote scream and a lot of that wink wink humor that's what they brought to the twentieth anniversary of a Halloween the ... section involved a little bit in the development at home and then the last ten years ago when Rob Zombie took over we were really in the middle of\nA phase where horror movies were getting gory or and they were just getting a lot more\nUpsetting to look at I was saying and then given it to rub zombie I mean he had his way with it and now currently I think that the horror movies or get a lot of attention and critical acclaim really focus on cultural issues um get out is probably the best example of that and Jimmy Curtis and all the interviews that she's been doing this I'm Talking about the new Halloween\nAs I'm a story about a trauma survivor and somebody who's trying to get over something bad that happened during what's funny is Barry either by coincidence or design the it's very unsettling to watch the first half of this movie Jimmy Curtis is out there telling people that my\nIt's funny it's very either by coincidence or design the\nIt's very unsettling to watch the first half of this movie Jimmy Curtis is out there telling people that Michael Meyers the killers out there and he's going to come back and he's going to hurt people and they don't want to believe her so she is a victim that does is not being believed him by her own family and I thought that was very relevant for the time\nIn my Michael Meyers the villain whose definitely stood the test of time I I Would agree I mean I'm not a whore guy at all I I mean truth be told I mean I've actually never seen Halloween so you know I'm not qualified to speak about this at all but I Know who he is and I've ... people's in reference to him what I can remember at least all my life\nWas always the you know you hear about Freddie Krueger Jason and Michael Meyers right\nThey are to this uh kinda generation or this um this culture a what a Dracula Frankenstein Wolfman a mommy older universal monsters from the Nineteen forties say they're the they're the new month or so I think part of the reason why Michael Meyers indoors is\nSo my my daughter's six years old and and um you know Sheila Santa Mr ... is what you would call the Halloween version of Santa\nOr he coincidentally looks just like Michael Meyers with a mask and everything and I had to think of something to say to her when she go into one of my rooms and see you know piece of memorabilia there and who is that and obviously she's far too young to watch a Halloween film but\nUh you know every morning she'll wake up and she'll run out to what's called the ghoulish graveyard to see if Mr Bo given left or something\nFor Halloween and I get a kick out of it because you know my daughter is learning about monsters and my wife doesn't really want that to happen but she can't can't\nShe and I want to go over to the late them household to get presents for Mr bogeyman kill so it was miserable humid doesn't leave just candies like presidents and things like that and he'll even a prize\nIn the graveyard yeah the ... you have a drink I created these tombstones I made them myself and they're\nNever going to turn the light so it's a whole Halloween is\nIt's great it's so great it's so cute he like we're not we're not selling anything I don't think his daughter or six years old is listening to cakes and\nYou know I don't think she has okay and so but Jason as hobbies like I was saying there's a pop cultural not to and you got some other pop cultural interests tell us all about oh you mean someone here in Jason's\nTop weird pop culture interests\nWe've already been through aloe and I'll tell you what else I'm a mother right now and I watch like lightning have you seen that know what's next Tuesday nights on the cw as a

the name major Garrett by via Amazon all great Internet booksellers at your local bookstore or Cosco built from my publisher last week\nFlying off the floors at cost goes around the country very good news All right we've got a big topic this week it's the elections coming up you possibly read something about that\nAnd the protection or the lack of protection\nAround those elections and there's nobody better to speak to that issue both globally and specifically than our guest he's got a really long Washington titled I'll get into that in the second his name is Chris Chris Chris say good morning or good morning ... a major [laughter]\nGood morning everyone it's good to have you with us what does that big Washington title here you go take a breath first\nUnder secretary for the department of homeland security is national protection and programs directorate otherwise known as the N. P. P. D.\nWashington has a massive habit of applying acronyms do just about everything so Chris crabs what does that mean national protection and programs director it\nIt is awful it is often a so the\nThe

two thousand seven when it was set up those kind of an island of misfit toys those things that had disparate functions that didn't fit elsewhere in the department whether it was TSA or FEMA or ice or CBP\nOut of the kind of it all together and then the pd now since two thousand seven when you look at it the landscapes of the things we'll talk about later in in a pod cast\nA cyber security two

think Russ are not very good it's kind of a man of few words so [laughter] very nice though we go to Chris\nChris Chris again I'm going to do the full title but just basically\nI just don't understand the department of homeland security cyber security and critical infrastructure bought the title under secretary department of homeland security national protection and programs directorate okay the topic we're going to really delve into an fellow by\nThe way Ryan it's your good morning so I'm very happy to be here very hungry mushroom omelet please and the shift throwing some bacon as well inside the um\nIt can as well inside the um that or do you have any er we we we chose yes ... that's ... ... ... and\nUh let me do coffee and I'll do the uh I'll do the yogurt\nAnd if they get ... like you were thinking All right\nI Want to play for you because one of the things we love about the show Chris is it's sort of a continuous conversation we have people up here here we archival things they say that we have our future just react to them\nSo we had a conversation not too long ago with Mark Warner the senator from Virginia I Know you're very familiar with Senator Warner vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee and we were talking about election security and your bureaucratic bailiwick so Eli that's number six politically\nVHS can offer technical services and assistance\nAnd down to the local level\nBut there's no requirement that local registrars will take it so my concern is Jay Jay is coming in with these expertise and some local registrars says well you know\nThat sounds good about um with the feds messing with my stuff I'm going to use my brother in law who's the IT specialists and there's no backstop on that on how we make sure that again that there was an appropriate audit\nAre there many brother in law's running I teased for a local election officials I you know what honestly I Do I Do think so I think uh the uh\nMedium and small businesses across the country that play a significant and important role in cyber security it's out there we've seen it out there I'm a there was a a an event that happened earlier this year where a company that I'd never heard of came in and did actually really good work\nSo uh this one is about the president might say it's a good thing not a bad thing to have a brother in law running I teach at a local election it's a good thing that everybody's involved okay but everyone involved that that's your threshold assessment you don't need because in your previous life in the private sector you work for Microsoft yeah\nKind of a big company has sort of a profile on these questions doesn't need to be Microsoft now is that in and it doesn't have to be the adjusts either and that's one thing that one of the things really\nAre undergoing while I Would like everyone to work with me it's not just positive that they have good security if they don't if they do or don't see what the age of ... and uh I Want to play also or something 'cause this goes to intense motive and who the threatening entities are out there this is\nThe president United States September twenty six at the United Nations General assembly that's number one Eli please\nRegrettably we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming twenty eight Cain election\nComing up in November against my administration they do not want me for us to win because I Am the first president ever to challenge China on trade\nAnd we are winning on trade we are winning at every level\nWe don't want them to metal or interfere in our upcoming election\nChris cribs to fly for my audience what the president means when he says interfere in meddling in the context of China and is there any evidence to point to about either so when you think about interference\nWhen you think about foreign influence you kind of have to look at it across the spectrum or number of different buckets ah where we'd seen the Russians the most active particularly sixteen was over in the election hacking the technical hacking of election equipment at the state and local level\nAnd then you have a couple of other buckets in one of them is social media influence campaigns another one is hacking and leaking of political campaigns like we saw with the DNC and put us the Russians on all three of those\nMedia influence campaigns another one is hacking and leaking of political campaigns like we saw with the DNC could ask the questions on all three of the oh yeah when he got ... and they they're they're very active in this space\nThey're noisy and their their priorities are more about creating divisiveness and undermining confidence in democratic prompting us against one of yes it and they've they've been quite effective\nOn the other side of the spectrum you have more\nSubtle political a policy\nBased engagements if the Chinese are actually very good at it as well there's much subtler it's quieter it's below the radar to a certain extent\nBut it's about um in some cases using um a media paid advertisements\nIt's about sympathetic spokesman but what they're trying to influence is a policy outcomes so they're trying to find ways to influence the mid west farmers about trade or something right in and really teasing out um what are the\nYou know it's a result of the poll they would do it in that would benefit their policy does the subtlety and the public nature of what China is doing make it less malevolent Oh absolutely not and in fact it's it's probably a little bit more insidious\nInsidious because in the way I say that the reason I say that because the again the Russians are there out front they're very involved we had a great deal of discussion\nOr about what they've been doing what they didn't sixteen but even back in sixteen when we first started talking about the Russians it was like oh well where's the evidence where's the evidence and it's like we're we're building the case in ... ah and then it blows open and it was so pervasive and across the board\nYou know what's going on right now with China it I feel to a certain extent were a little bit like where we weren't sixty so you just us pervasive in across the board I don't believe the president's even use that language to describe Russian twenty sixteen why is it difficult for him to be as open and declare it as you just work\nWell I look we've gone back and forth on this one a number of times but the president's been very clear and then he supports the intelligence community assessment of two thousand Seventeen January ... does that mean\nThat is the absolute baseline for establishing in a in a a articulating what Russia did across the election hacking space the hacking leak of political campaigns and in the social media and traditional media because you've got to got to remember\nIt wasn't always it wasn't only Facebook and Twitter\nAre there were exploited in those other social media campaign ... uh Archie and Sputnik ... which are generally audience well those are are they there well I mean basically\nThey are state sponsored media are really on television or see on the radio right and so they're a they're the voice of the Kremlin so important wants to get his message out there they amplify at Canada Trump talked to a party\nOr you did yeah I so [laughter] uh I Would have to go back and look at that and I'm sure he did I'm sure a lot of folks then yeah and what\nThe fifty four seconds before we go to break and we can carry over on this what is detectable now that the Russians are doing a twenty Eugene as much little or they backed off any so we've seen across the election hacking space or a steady drumbeat basically of\nAn activity that's ... yeah and it's it's hard to say and we don't have any attribution anywhere whether it's Russia or anywhere else right now\nWe do see actors you know day to day cyber security activity\nTargeting election equipment but it's not that there's been an increase necessarily we do have broader awareness based on his partnerships we've developed between ah the various states and local election officials\nSo we have a greater awareness out but we don't necessarily see a significant increase attributed to anyone else\nStates and local election officials so we have a greater awareness of but we don't necessarily see a significant increase attributed to anyone I got a major Garrett that's prescribed for the department of homeland security big topics separate security in the elections he does other things will get to those in a minute red firefly we have breakfast coming very\nSoon I Hope and we're looking down our coffee and more on the other side of this [noise] before we go to break it's time to learn more about this week's restaurant with Nikki no\nWord fire flying to email us who knows all sees all about the D.C restaurant scene is with us Nikky tell us about firefighters\nWell whatever about firefighters that it's in ... which is truly a neighborhood area of DC and this town has been here for Twenty years it's an attempt in property and chicken is really known for creating these neighborhood restaurants with in their hotel to people who stay in the hotel\nHow much is that a problem for you as you look at these underlying issues just the sheer number of people coming in so first and foremost I think that's a great thing\nA problem for you as you look at these underlying issues just the sheer number of people coming in so first and foremost I think that's a great thing I like the great thing that that folks are going to get out now you got to remember though yeah these systems are the broader election system in of itself ah\nWe got to be patient so when you get up at there's a line just take your time you know wait it out yet wait it out\nOr to the broader security space and the volume up and down isn't really going to stress our or capabilities or or anything along those lines we're still focused on a supporting the state and local folks getting them the information they need and you know for the if they have a bad they were there\nSo I mentioned Senator Warner on our show before takeout episode September fourteenth or in this sound by which I Want to play a number seven Eli he actually feel sorry not for you specifically but for you in general here's why\nIn normal world after this kind of election interference\nYou would appoint a White House Democrat or Republican would appoint someone to be an effect that convene her up policies on election security\nAnd I don't I feel bad for some of the ... of because they realize the fact that this president still doesn't acknowledge\nThe seriousness the attack means that we have no one in charge we have no White House individual that is trying to convene all these groups their efforts made department of homeland security but there's a lot of pushback on VHS just institution\nAddressed that I you know let's not mistake the lack of a person for the lack of coordination the coordination quitting ... mechanisms are there we work very closely with the director of national intelligence Dan Coats\nWe work very closely with the FBI and director ray and his team we understand our respective authorities and responsibilities\nThese things don't cut and merge cleanly\nWe've got to do our own part but to that point that we made earlier that\nBureaucracies relationships structures matter there is a sense that if somebody was in the White House every day to crack heads if necessary that person could and that person doesn't exist or you know a Ambassador Bolton is out in front on these issues we have a cybersecurity coordinator for sure but also the intelligence\nThat's got to remind I remember that that again the process sees that we're talking about here\nUh exist independent of whatever the the threat landscape looks like so when we're focused on something like election security we're able to scale up our resources as needed so I again\nI'm not that concerned that there is not an election security coordinator in the White House 'cause we're doing what we need to do I mentioned this before this is one aspect\nOf your job critical infrastructure as a part of your head up David Sanger who I think you know well either by reputation of personally probably both was on her show July thirteenth about his book the perfect weapon which is very much about this topic of overall cyber security this is number ten Eli this is a larger\nOr orientation to that same point go ahead\nIf there was a major cyberattack in coming months for years and you know there will be ones like you know hurricane season comes along right I Know you don't know where it's going to strike and I don't know when it's going to strike but you know there's going to be our game you know there's going to be a big cyber strike\nIf at some point we go back and say what happened to our defenses only to try to do this certainly an issue I think investigators Congress others would look at is why did you get rid of the top cyber security coordinator in the White House it you wouldn't imagine getting rid of a nuclear\nCoordinator you wouldn't imagine getting rid of nuclear coordinator and many on the show have said cybersecurity is the next battle space for\nA bit of a nuclear coordinator\nYou wouldn't imagine getting rid of nuclear coordinator and many on the show of said cybersecurity is the next battle space for our country this is a respected journalist who knows this issue will respond to that\nThere are a lot of varying opinions on this but again this goes to don't mistake the lack of a coordinator for the lack of coordination when you're lack of\nFocus because that's really what both these criticisms or the without a White House person there's less focused on their otherwise could be\nBut we have to keep in mind that when the White House coordinator position was stabbed what's in the early days of the Obama administration was because of the lack of maturity across the interagency and there were significant turf battles happening\nAt the time he just was the new kid on the block\nDidn't have the authorities didn't have the funding everything has changed in the intervening eight nine ... turf battles are over there the lines have been drawn right\nNow is there you know rice bowling sure what's that yeah well you know it's a little pieces of turf that folks are you know still kind of struggling over it you know protecting the writer\nSo we've heard that on the

Vegas gene here with climate control experts thank you so much for tuning into date to learn everything there is to know about your heating and air conditioning system we're\nGoing to talk about what to look for in the heating and cooling contractor and then are going to uncover the keys to making that sucker run for\nEver\nYou have somebody come out and tell you that you needed to replace your furnace or a conditioning system\nI interviewed a guy one time who said that the company that he worked for required him to try to sell new heating and cooling equipment to customers whose heating and air conditioning systems were two and three and four years old\nOh look I don't care how in efficient they claim your heating and air conditioning system is if it's less than eight years old you shouldn't even be having the conversation\nHow about your energy bills do you have energy bills to just keep going up and up and up did you replace your air conditioning system maybe or your furnace and not see the energy savings\nTheir gi bills to just keep going up and up and up did you replace your air conditioning system maybe or your furnace and not see the energy savings that you were promised\nI Want to talk to those of you out there who have a furnace or air conditioner or heat bumped that six or eight years old and you've been told to junkie it in my lifetime I can count on one hand how many six year old systems that I've seen that needed to be replaced\nMost of the time they just needed a really good cleaning\nIt's going to take you years to get your money back out of a new air conditioning system do you have six or eight grand just lying around that you want to Chuck it your heating and cooling system\nOr would you rather spend just a little bit of money getting it cleaned up operating more efficiently lower your energy bills viewer breakdowns and more money in your pocket\nNow we're gonna talk a little bit about what you should expect from the heating and air conditioning company that's coming out to maintain your system because I've got a feeling that a lot of you out there have been getting the drive by maintenance\nYou'll recognize it it's the one where they come out for twenty to forty five minutes ask you for fifty sixty Seventy bucks and then they're gone\nMaybe they hook up a set of refrigerant gauges maybe not\nIf somebody's not spending at least Seventy five to Ninety minutes you need to get somebody else\nA climate control experts to not\nUsually takes between Seventy five two hundred and twenty minutes from start to finish now we call that cleaning or tuna a total system rejuvenation\nAnd it includes cleaning your outdoor coils and inspection and documentation of about sixty Seventy different components in your furnace and air conditioner\nSome of you are going sixty to Seventy different components that's a lot of stuff right\nWell when our guys show up they spend an average is Seventy five to a hundred and twenty minutes

wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I got to get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI lean in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't

got to be the first person okay that clean my heater dot com\nLet's take some time to talk about something that way too many people overlook okay and that's what's in the air in our homes you hear a lot of talk about air pollution and air quality and the environment right\nBut did you know that the environmental protection agency the EPA says that the air and our homes is often more polluted than the air of the largest cities in the United states\nAnd with all the time and energy that we spent trying to clean up the environment to ensure that were breathing clean air\nPeople often ignore their own homes the air and your own home is where we get exposed to things like molds and bacteria and allergens and chemicals so how does the air in our homes get polluted\nWell some of the chemicals that we find in our air\nAre from things like cleaning products underneath their sank plastics look at all the stuff in your house that's made a plastic\nAll of that stuff actually off gases or releases chemicals into your air for years\nTaints everybody's got paint on the wall right that stuff off gases that's our they've got the OC free paints nowadays there's glues there's pressed woods there's furniture all that stuff made with chemicals in it\nThan there are the molds and allergens that come into our homes from outside through doors and windows and unsealed air ducts and when you go outside mold attaches itself to your clothing\nEven your pets carry mold spores into the house with them okay and the worst part is that it can and almost always does grow in our homes\nAnd most people don't realize that your air conditioner doesn't bring new air into your house but then it just constantly recycles the same old air that's already in your home\nThat means that if there are chemicals and molds and pollutants in the air they're going to just keep re circulating unless you have something in place to remove them\nThey are just magically going to disappear or right\nAnd the air in your home can circulate over a hundred times per day through your air conditioning system which means that all of the pollutants just keep circulating for you and your family to keep breathing in\nThis can lead to a major major health problems over time I said it before and I'll say it again if you don't have a good filter for your air or your air conditioner\nYou become the filter\nThink about that you either filter the air with your lungs or you get a good filter you choose\nThink about that you either filter the air with your lungs or you get a good filter you choose\nSo let's focus on the molds and the allergens that are found in the air okay 'cause the fact of the matter is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air conditioner\nLast time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens and you can have side effects from them right seven of them are toxic okay so what are the side effects and breathing mold\nObviously everyone's different but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects that we're able if I were talking about things like upset stomachs weight gain fatigue\nLoss of sleep night sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell auto immune disorders or sexual side effects and let's not forget about depression\nPeople often experience allergy like symptoms not realizing that the air that they're breathing in their homes is the main problem\nSo what are people doing to remove these molds and allergens from the air that circulating over and over and over again in their home\nWhile there are a few different methods but the one most common method and the most effective is using ultra violet light okay\nSo let's talk about these ultraviolet lights have you guys heard about these things well the first guy to have a breakthrough using ultraviolet light was Neal's fenced in back in Nineteen oh three and Neal's won the Nobel Prize for his work using ultraviolet lights to treat tuberculosis\nAnd because of Neal Simpsons work ultraviolet light has since become the gold standard and it's used in many different ways and the medical field okay it's used to sterilize the air and hard surfaces and pretty much every hospital throughout the United states\nUltraviolet light is used to sterilize water if you have a well you might actually use it to sterilize the wealth from bacteria there used to sterilize food and for the last twenty five years or so ultraviolet light has been used in residential home heating and air conditioning systems\nWhy because of ultraviolet lights unbelievable ability to destroy the nasty stuff we were just talking about things like molds and bacteria is that take up residence in your home heating and air conditioning system\nGet in on the best offer we have right now we only do this on the radio remember it includes the duct work inspection so grab

somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes during a tune up frankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by June up too\nSo what do you want to do if you got one of those companies well I'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you ask them to have the technician give us sixty seconds heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone call\nIt is for you ask them to have the technician give us sixty second heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone call and when you get that telephone call half of your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich get richer\nAnd as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay because you're really getting anything\nAnd in some cases they're doing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible now I'm offering this for Seventy nine dollars today but you only get one shot at it okay at least for the Seventy nine dollars from\nThat point forward you'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll be happy to pay the regular price and if you get set up in one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts and priorities service almost everybody that we see gets one of the maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter is that everybody and I mean everybody in the Las Vegas area needs this I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil and your car what's gonna happen if you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace their voters to\nSame deal folks if you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer if you want to keep the warranty and clean one runs so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all the time my airs blowing a lot harder is that normal well yeah we pulled out your blow or you had us clean it it was all gone up it should be moving more air\nMy furnishing their conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goal we\nDon't want it to run this much that way your energy bills aren't as high end ... D you middle sized properly or humidifiers properly depending on the season\nSo let's summarize folks real quick so that you know what you're going to get from a company like climate control experts\nThen I'm going to open up the phone lines again and allows some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for Seventy nine bucks and you're absolutely going to love the service I promise and remember I'm going to give you that Seventy nine bucks back\nOn the way out the door actually going to give you your money back then that crazy amazing\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technicians to arrive\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let 'em in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat part\nAnd he'll reach down and put on shoe covers over his shoes or boots we also called them for savers he's going to wear those each time he enters your house they'll\nShow you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I see anything that's going to give you a challenge and the future I'm On the market and this column over here\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can\nIt's going to give you challenges in the future I'm going to market and this column over here and if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can\nOnce he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working\nNext to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit at which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext as we get the leaves and sticks in mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and Ross out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of a unit and you've got to get in a new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your ... from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right\nAnd it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass clippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires because sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish\nIt can cause big things to go wrong All right\nYou may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started that's about to go bad\nYou may have a pending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or for him is\nWe'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right we'll check all your hoses your drains your flame sensor and even run a little test on your ignite or to make sure that it's not about to go out on you when it gets cold All right because of that happens\nYour house is going to
