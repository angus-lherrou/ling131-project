screwed right\nTo their health care and that means socialized medicine tuition free college that means is snowflakes get to go and and being able to safe zones will cost them anything at all and stop fossil fuel production entirely\nWhich means that you'll be able to ride your bike a lot of driving your car\nShe says there's no debate as to whether we should continue producing fossil fuels she says there's no debate we should not\nThat's right you cannot debate the issue when you have a genius like Alexander to go to our guys are going to tell me what the truth is why even think about debating it she knows the truth she knows the truth\nThank God for her she knows the truth\nOr by the way are the geniuses a position to parts and some of that over ... fellow Democrats who advocate\nWhat the Obama administration turned all the above energy policy which I've been talking about for years embracing oil and natural gas production as well as the generation of renewables like wind and solar I Would include nuclear in this by the way I Would include everything and anything to keep us energy independent\nAmerica's natural gas production has surged in recent years fueled in part by the fracking boom that is produced thousands of jobs\nAnd billions in revenue billions not millions billions in revenue alright\nAnd she wants to put us back into the stone age so when you get

and storage solve [noise]\nAll right uh\nYeah if if and if you have thoughts I Would like the if you if you're a parent of any kid in I'm\nIn school to kill a high school I imagine I don't know if if middle school a school like junior high school kids are doing this or not or every time that somebody goes on they try to the video it and they put it on Twitter they put it on Facebook\nAnd I and I guess the thing is is that um you know the kids everyone is trying to outdo the other there's they say there is social pressure to be impressive via the Internet that didn't used to exist well that's true we didn't have anything like that\nWhen I grew up at all nothing like it and uh adults may not be as familiar with what their kids are doing online or with Twitter\nAnd I agree with the thoughts from these school police who were saying that the kids that are posting these things the fights and all that stuff going on a social media are really encouraging this kind of behavior\n\nAnd then other kids going to be more encouraged to find a bigger fight and along or what and what more blood and you know more more growth is as some people look at I posted this the other guy doesn't matter anymore you know he had to fight with four people I got it with you know ten wow how cool\n\nSo police are forced to pepper spray these kids fifty kids are were affected by the pepper spray\nYou know what a again thought is next time this happens don't stick around don't stick around or don't get your nose right in the middle of it and maybe you won't get affected by the pepper spray just saying that's all\nI'm\nThe latest also that has come out I found this to be kind of interesting not a big shopper there but a Walmart has agreed to pay sixty five million dollars to nearly a hundred thousand\nCalifornia employees who claim the retail giant refuse to provide them with seeding while they worked the um these cashiers\nWanted stools to sit while they were working and\nThe Wal Mart said it would these students to be a safety hazard would make workers less productive\n\nThey did allow certain you know employees a certain medical conditions or disability to have schools but store managers had the discretion of providing sitting on a case by case basis now Wal Mart says it will be providing seating to all its cashiers in California and they asked the question I mean I just I'm I I again I I don't go to Wal Mart that often ever\nBut you know I go to a lot of other places that have cashiers supermarkets and things like that\nNone of these caches of sitting down I mean I'm sure no none of them are sitting down there all standing go to ... go anywhere at all whole foods they're standing\nSo I guess the snowflakes with a Wal Mart and California need to be able to sit down\nKnow they're just getting all the time I I don't understand I just don't get what the deal is why Wal Mart had given up a sixty five million dollars as well as getting the\nSchools for the people why I mean what\nI don't get what was behind that whole thing I Do not understand it you know congrats that they wound up getting that they care but why I mean what was the deal behind it\nBy the way speaking of stores just real quickly quick mentioned here who want to do more than that turns out that Sears is a hanging by a thread and they're saying it looks like it will be open for at least one more holiday shopping season and that's it\nOr they're also saying that the Sears had made a deal is there but at least through Christmas before actually filing bankruptcy for the whole thing\nThey want to actually find someone to buy the company before the end of the year and they're going to be shutting down uh stores some immediately they have about Ninety thousand people across the country\nI think it's unfortunate because uh I remember one time when Sears was really a great store it really was and that's too bad that uh they're going the way of um of yesterday's shoes\nVery very much a lot of people are buying things online though and lock the brick and mortar stores are having lots of problems I don't know why Sears ... Kmart by the way I could never figure that one out at me Sears is was doing all watch it fail [laughter] what k-mart was not\nExactly high end I mean you know I mean I Know that there are\nBlue might in there are now I mean I Know there's not many I never did I Want to be ... where I don't I thought I thought there were still\nWon over near like Boulder and something that there is one of the heritage to where\nI don't know but I walked into one man that that thing that you know I was horrible you walked in you walked right out goodbye you know you know in an outdoor thing I wanted it by then I bought on line they didn't have their\n[laughter] why would they buy that though I mean that was a failing company anyway now they're going to be paying the price is well alright seven three three case that the seven three three five Ninety six eight\nI Will come back in a few moments of ... the share with you as well don't forget next hour movie reviews pet pick of the week in much much more coming up at four forty eight chance to win the tickets to the mob museum exclusively right here I ...
