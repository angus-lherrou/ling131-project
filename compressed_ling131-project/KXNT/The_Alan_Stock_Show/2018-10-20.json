Volkswagen is selling them really quickly and they they just haven't done much in the way of incentives and don't typically does not\nA ... and then the third one I Would throw at your Hector look at the newest Subaru Ascent\nPets okay\nI've I've got a review and video up on it that I put up a few months ago and yet I tell you what if you want to talk safety that's the vehicle to to to really focus in on it it comes off it's got the eyesight system which I talk about all the time is probably the best\nIt's probably the best a safety system out there without getting into\nYou know a hundred thousand dollar SUVs um it works amazing it it it it saves lives so I think those three would be good choice but if it were me and I had small ones I was trying to protect I'd probably put the scent right there at the top\nOh wow that's huge okay\nBut look at the review you'll see what you'll see what I'm Talking about a ... I talk about the outside system a lot in the review a ... and it's it's priced right there with the Highlander and the pilot infected maybe a little bit less\nA bit but super is really good on their leasing too\nAnd uh I've got great super directive got great deals for all three of those when you're at the website looking at the review looking certified dealers you'll choose Los Angeles\nAnd uh and and you'll you'll be well taken care of I appreciate your phone calls her very much thinking and let me know how I can help you\nKnow let's talk to Richard in ...

system running like a tough\nAnd now here's your host\nHey Las Vegas gene here with climate control experts thank you so much for tuning into date to learn everything there is to know about your heating and air conditioning system we're going to talk about what to look for in the heating and cooling contractor and then are going to uncover the keys to making that sucker run for\nEver\nYou have somebody come out and tell you that you needed to replace your furnace or a conditioning system\nI interviewed a guy one time who said that the company that he worked for required him to try to sell new heating and cooling equipment to customers whose heating and air conditioning systems were two and three and four years old\nOh look I don't care how in efficient they claim your heating and air conditioning system is if it's less than eight years old you shouldn't even be having the conversation how about your energy bills do you have energy bills to just keep going up and up and up did you replace you\nThe conversation how about your energy bills do you have energy bills to just keep going up and up and up did you replace your air conditioning system maybe or your furnace and not see the energy savings that you were promised\nI Want to talk to those of you out there who have a furnace or air conditioner or heat bump that six or eight years old and you've been told to junk it in my lifetime I can count on one hand how many six year old systems that I've seen that needed to be replaced\nMost of the time they just needed a really good cleaning\nIt's going to take you years to get your money back out of a new air conditioning system do you have six or eight grand just lying around that you want to Chuck it your heating and cooling system\nOr would you rather than just a little bit of money getting it cleaned up operating more efficiently lower your energy bills viewer breakdowns and more money in your pockets\nNow we're gonna talk a little bit about what you should expect from the heating and air conditioning company that's coming out to maintain your system because I got a feeling that a lot of you out there have been getting the drive by maintenance\nYou'll recognize it it's the one where they come out for twenty to forty five minutes ask you for fifty sixty Seventy bucks and then they're gone\nMaybe they hook up a set of refrigerant gauges maybe not\nIf somebody's not spending at least Seventy five to Ninety minutes you need to get somebody else\nA climate control experts to not\nUsually takes between Seventy five two hundred and twenty minutes from start to finish now we call that cleaning or tuna a total system rejuvenation\nAnd it includes cleaning your outdoor coils and inspection and documentation of about sixty to Seventy different components in your furnace and air conditioner\nSome of you are going sixty Seventy different components that's a lot of stuff right\nWell when our guys show up they spend an average of Seventy five to a hundred and twenty minutes working to get your heating and air conditioning system as close to factory fresh condition as possible not to mention their criminal background checked and drug screen to\nDid you know that the number one and number two trades being taught in the prisons today we're plumbing in air conditioning\n[noise] that's right folks the number one and number two trades being taught in the president's today are plumbing an air conditioning\nNow listen folks I'm not saying that I don't believe that people deserve a second chance I really do believe that if you made a mistake and you did time for it when you get out you should be able to get a job\nI just decided I wasn't going to put them in your home well fellas if your wife's going to be the one that's home when the heating and air conditioning guy comes by do you want to take a chance that that person as someone who learned heating and cooling in the pen\nDo you have kids how 'bout them did you know the fifty percent of the guys that I have interviewed can't pass a nationwide criminal background check\nFolks I went through over one hundred resumes in a period of three weeks and only hired one person climate control experts they're very selective about who they put in your home\nI Want to talk about one of the gentlemen I interviewed and keep in mind when I Do an interview I asked them all kinds of questions about how they do the work I asked them how to test the cup\nWhen I Do an interview I asked them all kinds of questions about how they do the work I asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean the blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question\nI asked him I lean in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nDid you hear that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all\nI don't have a problem with it at all and the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nNext we're going to test all the electrical components in your system to make sure that you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got a filter that's all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're gonna check all of those little miniscule components that don't cost that much at all so repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or your furnace\nWe'll check the burners your pressure switches make sure that the exhaust is venting properly all of your hoses your drains a your flame sensor even run a little own test they call it on your ignite here because if that little baby goes bad it's gonna get cold in your house in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check the heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and delete carbon monoxide\nDo you see now why I say that you have to do these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe are going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine\nAre going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there's if you have them but you know how your filters look and advice you whether or not there's something more time or cost effective\nAt the end of the day it's about making you more comfortable in your home and saving money All right so get it to end up it doesn't cost you anything it actually pays you to do that alright get it cleaned up\nHey you want another reason to get your heating and air conditioning system tuned up have you ever heard of Louisiana State university\nWell they did a study that compared electrical usage of a dirty heating and air conditioning system to clean heating and air conditioning equipment and what they found was that the average customer with a clean system just one system in their house clean one\nSaved thirty two dollars and Seventy cents

of these just for you but you've got to be the first person okay that clean my heater dot com\nHey let's take some time to talk about something that way too many people overlook okay and that's what's in the air in our homes you hear a lot of talk about air pollution and air quality and the environment right but\nDid you know that the environmental protection agency the EPA says that the air in our homes is often more polluted than the air of the largest cities in the United states\nAnd with all the time and energy that we spent trying to clean up the environment to ensure that were breathing clean air\nPeople often ignore their own homes the air and your own home is where we get exposed to things like molds and bacteria and allergens and chemicals\nSo how does the air in our homes get polluted\nWell some of the chemicals that we find in our air are from things like cleaning products underneath your sink plastics look at all the stuff in your house that's made a plastic all of that stuff actually off gases or releases chemicals into your air for years\nPaints everybody's got paint on the wall right that stuff off gases that's our they've got the OC free paints nowadays\nThere's glues there's pressed woods there's furniture all that stuff made with chemicals in it\nThan there are the molds and allergens that come into our homes from outside through doors and windows and unsealed air ducts and when you go outside mold attaches itself to your clothing\nEven your pets carry mold spores into the house with them okay and the worst part is that it can and almost always does grow in our homes\nAnd most people don't realize that your air conditioner doesn't bring new air into your house but then it just constantly recycles the same old air that's already in your home\nThat means that if there are chemicals and molds and pollutants in the air they're going to just keep re circulating unless you have something in place to remove them\nThey are just magically going to disappear right\nAnd the air in your home can circulate over a hundred times per day through your air conditioning system which means that all of the pollutants just keep circulating for you and your family to keep breathing in\nThis can lead to a major major health problems overtime I said it before and I'll say it again if you don't have a good filter for your air or your air conditioner\nYou become the filter\nThink about that you either filter the air with your lungs\nFor your air or your air conditioner you become the filter think about that you either filter the air with your lungs or you get a good filter you choose\nSo let's focus on the molds and the allergens that are found in the air okay 'cause the fact of the matter is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air conditioner\nLast time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens and you can have side effects from them right seven of them are toxic okay so what are the side effects of breathing mold\nObviously everyone's different but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects that we're able to find we're talking about things like\nUpset stomachs weight gain fatigue loss of sleep\nNight sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell auto immune disorders or sexual side effects and let's not forget about depression\nPeople often experience allergy like symptoms not realizing that the air that they're breathing in their homes is the main problem\nSo what are people doing to remove these molds and allergens from the air that's circulating over and over and over again in their home\nWhile there are a few different methods but the one most common method and the most effective is using ultra violet light okay\nSo let's talk about these ultraviolet light so have you guys heard about these things well the first guy to have a breakthrough using ultraviolet light was Neal's fenced in back in Nineteen oh three and Neal's won the Nobel Prize for his work using ultraviolet lights to treat tuberculosis\nAnd because of Neal Simpsons work ultraviolet light has since become the gold standard and it's used in many different ways in the medical field okay it's used to sterilize the air and hard surfaces and pretty much every hospital throughout the United states\nUltraviolet light is used to sterilize water if you have a well you might actually use it to sterilize the wealth from bacteria\nUsed to sterilize food and for the last twenty five years or so ultraviolet light has been used in residential home heating and air conditioning systems why\nBecause of ultraviolet lights unbelievable ability to destroy the nasty stuff we were just talking about things like molds and bacteria is that\nWe only do this on the radio remember it includes the duct work inspection so grab your pen or your phone and dial quickly are

talk a little bit about the drive by maintenance okay somebody you were sitting there laughing going what's the drive by maintenance well if you have somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes during a tune up\nFrankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too\nSo what do you want to do if you got one of those companies well I'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you ask them to have the technician give you\nThe company's well I'll tell you exactly what to do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you ask them to have the technician give us sixty seconds heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone call\nAnd when you get that telephone call half of your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich get richer\nAnd as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay because you're really getting anything\nAnd in some cases they're doing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible now I'm offering this for Seventy nine dollars today but you only get one shot at it okay at least for the Seventy nine dollars from that point forward\nYou'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll be happy to pay the regular price\nAnd if you get set up on one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts and priorities service almost everybody that we see gets one of the maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter is that everybody and I mean everybody in the Las Vegas area needs this I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil in your car what's going to happen\nIf you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace throat hurts to seem deal folks if you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer if you want to keep the warranty and the clean one\nRuns so much better than a dirty one I get phone calls from customers all the time my ears blowing a lot harder is that normal well yeah we pulled out your blow or you had as clean it it was all gone up it should be moving more air\nMy furnishing their conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goal we don't want it to run this much that way your energy bills aren't as high end ... D you middle sized properly for humidifiers properly depending on the season\nSo let's summarize folks real quick so that you know what you're going to get from a company like climate control experts\nThen I'm going to open up the phone lines again and allows some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for Seventy nine bucks and you're absolutely going to love the service I promise I remember I'm going to give you that Seventy nine bucks back\nOn the way out the door actually going to give you your money back then that crazy amazing\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technician to arrive\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let 'em in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat part\nAnd he'll reached down and put on shoe covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's going to wear those each time he enters your house they'll\nYou the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I mean they're going to mark okay or if I see anything that's going to give you challenges in the future\nSystem and as I'm going through your system I'm either going to mark okay or if I see anything that's going to give you challenges in the future I'm In a market in this column over\nHere and if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can\nNow once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice he'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working next to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit\nAt which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tuna now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext as we get the leaves and sticks and mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and rushed out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of a unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge\nDifference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right\nAnd it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass clippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as right if\nThey're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical\nComponents in your system all the connections make sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nBecause sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish it can cause big things to go wrong\nAll right you may have a pending compressor failure because you've got a little started it's about to go bad you may have a pending\nMotor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or for him is we'll check the burners your pressure switches\nMake sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right we'll check all your hoses your drains you flame sensor and even run a little test on your ignite or to make sure that it's not about to go out on you when it gets cold All right because of that happens\nYour house is going to get cold in a\nMost important ally we're going to check your heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide\nDC now why I say that you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice we are going to check the temperature\nDo you see now why I say that you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe're going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine we're going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there's if you have them let you know how your filters look and advice you whether or not there's something more time or cost effective\nAt the end of the day\nIt's about making you more comfortable in your home and saving money All right so get it tuned up it doesn't cost you anything it actually pays you to do that alright\nGet it cleaned up\nAnd look if you want to experience everything we've been talking about here on the radio without the risk of going in playing Google roulette I'm going to give five more of these away at Seventy nine dollars right now\nRemember you're
