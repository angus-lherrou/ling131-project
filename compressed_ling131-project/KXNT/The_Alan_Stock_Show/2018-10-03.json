are parties I Can't believe some of these ones that you know county clerk\nThat makes no sense at all but anyway I'm Glad you agree with me on that one state George thank you so much for calling appreciate it and he joined I called back anytime my friend is good hearing from you or seven three three cats in the Senate or a three five nights a say so let's stick on this theme of kids in school doing ... things you have a young kid\nBringing a nine year old if I'm not mistaken bringing a gun the school wasn't loaded I understand he had the bullets and he had the magazine and all that jazz but um you\nKnow when you're doing the right to you you're going after the or the father and this was irresponsible\nWell yes we did bring charges against the father's name is Brian Klein we filed to charges a felony child abuse and neglect or endangerment and a misdemeanor which\nIs aiding a child under the age of Eighteen to possess a firearm let Mr Klein is innocent until proven guilty he's entitled to that presumption of innocence he's entitled due process of law and to have his case heard in the courtroom but we found like having a yeah so we felt based upon the facts and circumstances\nThat bringing the charges was appropriate because it all comes down\nTo denying access\nAh ah two children of dumb and Israel indeed there were a couple of guns actually were this child had access\nAnd you know even though thank God we didn't have a dead child this time around and I like we've had in so many cases but the child brought a gun or\nA magazine with bullets in it and another single bullet to school and also there was an ... I thought it was on the well the guard was loaded but if there was a separate bullet that he brought with the ... I I mean you know so it would have been just as easy for somebody to put a bullet into the done and then I ...\nAnd a gun to this is a nice time this year this has happened as any other situation as there and be in any other arrests in any of those other eight other cases that you think about it over and\nHad been arrested certainly all the children that bring the guns on campus or arrested and taken to the juvenile detention so what about the parents have to leave that the parents have been when there has been serious injury or death\nYes but I Know there has been other parents\nThat had been charged with crimes by allowing access a by their children to their weapons yes\nHe said if there's serious injury or ... but with this kid that nobody has singer I mean that's true but it's still a crime\nI I agree with you I agree with let's\nSee if there is an injury to the child or another child or it isn't enhanced charge of child abuse and neglect\n[noise] okay uh we have charged other parents in situations depending on the facts and circumstances\nUm nine times of year I think so far they've found\nThat I thought it was ten actually and I think there might have been to others in charter schools that they're not even counting\nSo I think there might be twelve or Thirteen in ... and the message is if you're a gun owner to properly store your weapon and you can do that to still allow yourself to have a direct enemy or access for self protection and protection of your your loved ones but to dot denied access to children whose children are curious\nYou know in this case a nine year old ... year old eleven year old that did it go walking around in the bedrooms when their parents aren't home looking around\nWe've had situations in the past maybe not as they hear the house where where a young kids three four five find the guy and they kill themselves or somebody else accidentally ... you know you and I totally agree on that we've had K. you know ... responsibility for ... I Believe in second than a thousand percent\nBut take response of there's a responsibility that goes with your rights as well\nWe we've even had a case where a child was depressed and suffering from a mental health issue went in and gained access to a weapon and shot and killed himself committed suicide\nSmoke that parents had denied the access that child might be alive today I mean I think in that case and it's very sad but like you said gun owners have to be responsible\nI I I actually agree Seventy three Seventy seven three three five nights I say I was going to ask you about this but Steve is calling Steve you're on the next day I cannot for reading Steve you're on Cape Cod which the Wilson uh if you have questions go right ahead\nI have a quick question to my favorite guy now on a ... year will be that allow ... and\nI um I happen to be on eastern avenue that morning that that ... ...\nWow you're talking about a case involving a lean older at and the eight year old boy\nI got a young man I might happen and if you're happy you're argument murder\nYeah that's one of the update Steve thanks for calling in ... and I would like to update you're listening\nTo my friend I appreciate your calling please call back anytime it I'll go right ahead\nOf that a woman who we did charged with murder alien ... was in court this morning and I went and watched the court appearance\nI Do that a lot of these cases because I Want to feel what's going on in the courtroom and see the defendant says they're pleading guilty and she pled guilty to second degree murder or this morning along with two other accounts of felony DUI so she's looking at a very minimum\nOf twenty five years in prison without parole eligibility after ten plus potential consecutive terms of imprisonment of two to Twenty years in prison for the felony DUI charges\nSo she's going to spend a significant amount of the same time zone except potentially because it'll be up to the sentencing judge okay term in where in the range of two to Twenty years in prison for each of the two felony DUI charges and whether those charges one can current er consecutive\nTo the mandatory ten to twenty five on the murder charge and what's unique about this case Alan and that's why we even\nHeld a little press conference a couple of weeks ago is that we don't normally charge people that are involved in traffic collisions with murder\nIf there's drugs or alcohol involved if there's reckless driving we charge him with the DUIs and reckless driving the leaving of the scenes but because of the circumstances of this case where she was going over one hundred miles an hour\nA weaving in between a travel lanes and going through to red light ... in an area where there was a school at eight thirty in the morning we deem that to be\nA terrible that we charged with murder and she pled guilty to that the small\nShoes on the influence of marijuana and how the alcohol is was that'll just marijuana was just Maryland was four and a half times over the legal limit ... and the other ones involved if you're aware of my understanding is there were slight amounts of other drugs but not to a degree\nThat would that would contribute to the impairment but not alcohol though no alcohol\nOkay I'm good I'm Glad to talk to her um and and I hope that the sentencing judge it gives you the max all the way around and then I Hope in the headlines the next day in the paper that says I'm\nA you know you go ahead and get involved and using drugs and drive crazy and kill somebody you're going to spend fifty years in prison\nAnd then there's another case we have I mean that you like to have updates during your show where we charged another person with similar conducted Jonathan Mora\nAre on the fifteenth day of September so just you know less than three weeks ago\nHe was driving a vehicle and he was going about a hundred miles an hour and it was on east they just valley drive\nA near south mountains is to St September Fifteen and he uh rear ended another vehicle and initially the ten year old passenger in his vehicle I think it was his nephew yes was substantially injured\nBut then later passed away so Mr Moore has been charged with murder when you could find them with use of the deadly weapon and then charges of\nLeaving the scene of an accident child abuse and reckless driving and there are two felony warrants out for his arrest right now and I guarantee you the authorities are looking for Mr Moore\nI Hope they find them and hope you suck up to seven three three cats and two seven three three five nine six eight\nWe gonna come on back I got more people want to talk to you to more calls coming in and we got some more things to try out about a crime in in the valley here and also want to get your thoughts your memories only one day away ah from what happened one year ago last night I'm Alice stock and this is Kay ex ante\nSyrian Government she thinking

show this afternoon and Ron\nYeah I I'd like to know do we do I the promise program in Clark County because we know our Factory Floor day in Chicago it's man\nI'm not familiar with that program run what is the promise program\n[laughter] ah actually I got a lot of notoriety in Florida for sure what it is very similar to a Jew keeping juveniles system and the letter that entails\nCounseling and this type of thing but the case in Florida\nRyan offensive against them and not one was recorded\nViolent offenses by the way so yeah yeah exactly\nWell let me let me try to answer your question because the program which I was describing earlier which is called the harbor the resource and assessments center down in the cabinet facility and the first two years they have a service over four thousand children\nAnd they have a four percent failure rate meaning a Ninety six percent of the children benefited from the assessment and the treatment that they were given\nA which is phenomenal and the services are also provided to the parents so the children are brought in there's an assessment done and if there's issues involving the parents the\nParents them and after voluntarily participate but whatever uh tools they can provide to the parents are provided as well to an extremely successful program it sounds like something similar to the promise program\nYeah except that they don't do that counts I ... and after nine times I think somebody got a\nWell I agree after a certain number of times if the perjury as in Arlington I yes if the person is willing to be helped and the system isn't helping then you got to elevate them up yeah ...\nI mean now it's going on in Chicago so that's where the program came from\n... you don't get\nThat program area you sound like you're stressing out saying that the first stage that's\nPretty good asked Ron officially Oh thank you so much for joining us this afternoon what kind of a charge you going to give to the ... ... ... are still these puppies that bothers me [laughter]\nForgive me for laughing but I just I didn't expect you to be going there he'll be charged in fact I think he was arrested today um so I haven't seen any of the reports on the case yet but you know probably burglary for entering the pet shop without permission for probably grand larceny for stealing the puppies probably animal abuse\nOr you know we're going to potentially throw the book at this guy because of what he did but you know thrown to the dogs yeah Mm okay let them go ahead and do let the dogs out yeah who\nDon't even know who did that I mean what he did you know I think there was an accomplice to by stealing the puppies and apparently one of the puppies needed a some pretty consistent regular seatings because the puppy was so small\nAnd I don't think when they arrested this guy is reported today that there was information that the puppies were recovered not only not only to take and as I understand it I thought there were only two taken\nThan just what I thought too but they're saying that they only recovered too but I understand that there I I I don't know they are recovered alive skews me they recovered and one of the two canines use cues are stealing well that's good\nSo um and\nThere are no signs of the missing two month\nOld Pomeranian yeah that's the one that I think needed regular meeting and things

credit to students who didn't turning the homework now it is in the um student handbook student ... handbook that um\nIf you get an F ... is left to yet between fifty fifty nine points somehow\nEight zero is noted on the scale for work not attempted to work that is a complete that's what the teacher says and she was instructed though by the people who are the principles will\nNever ever ever ever get a student is zero as a handbook states never do that\nShe says by the way a grade and Mrs Toronto's class is earned wow how 'bout that\nThis is a a part of a of a policy and a trend going through this entire country\nBecause we're winding up with is a this happening coast to coast this particular story comes out of port St Lucie Florida\nSay another story\nI have a cousin who was a a a great teacher at the time he since retired plot forty two years in the LA Unified School district and uh he taught English very very very dedicated guy\nAnd um\nHe was a matter of fact I dedicated a he put together a a source of money to be able to get together students to take them to a a writing camp every year\nSo they didn't have to pay anything taught in Huntington park you know you can park is in Southern California it's not exactly the bastion of um of richness\nAnd ... a lot of poor folks there and today it's it's mostly Latino\nAnd a lot of those folks who've come from a south aboard a lot of illegal\nBut he got this together every year to get them in a a a in this\nSummer camp where they ... for about a week or so and it was somewhere I don't know north of Malibu I don't know where it was\nAnd they um they would you know give kids an opportunity to be able to improve their writing skills so he would pick the kids who you know he thought were really making an effort he went out of his way to do this on his own time and ah he would accompany them on his own dime\nOh that went on all those years he was a it was a great teacher I can tell you that knowing him a great teacher\nAnd uh they eventually figure that\nThey didn't want people there who are making as much money as he did and then there is long so they start shifting him around instead of him having great classic\nAre putting them in with kids who are we're not the brightest as a matter of fact uh he had uh some classes where the kids most of them did not even speak English they were illegal alien kids\nI don't know if you notice but when a for many many years when illegals cross the border they went to one of two spots in one of them are was Huntington park in California the reason for that being this was the so called quote unquote distribution point we're illegals we'd get\nDirection where to go and and you know how to be a company and everything like that at least in part Southern California\nSo they start putting them in with kids who were not the best not the brightest locked didn't speak English and after he had been teaching ... years and doing an incredible job there was one year when almost every kid in the one semester with almost ... almost every kid in the class\nGot an F almost every kid in the class so my cousin\nWas called into the principal's office and he was made to answer for doing this how can you give ... to almost every kid in the ... you can't do that so he had the documentation about what each kid did or did not do in this case\n\nAnd showed it to the principal this is what happened they did not turn this and didn't do that didn't accomplish this didn't participate in that\nPrincipal said I don't care you cannot fail all these kids that was terrible\nAnd he was forced he was forced to go ahead and give them passing great again these are what I have no idea but he had to give them some kind of a past couldn't give the maps that would be terrible\nEven though these kids earned it they earned it\nThis is the editor they are that is going on in our public school system today\nHuge attitude\nAnd that's why the saloons fired as a teacher from Port St Lucie because she said when kids didn't do anything in they shouldn't get a great at all vision guinea points in the school district said you're crazy you're these kids points fifty to fifty nine points you know if they don't do sweat\nSeven three three ... accent the seven three three five nine six eight\n\nAlright I real quick before we do anything at all\nI Want you to know that
