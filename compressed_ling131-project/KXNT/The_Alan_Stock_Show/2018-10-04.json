which is that none of these allegations\nHave been cooperated none of the witnesses who've been named by the the people who have come forward have said they know anything about these are these allegations and I'm hopeful that ah when the vote to start the process or start\nIt takes plus tomorrow and then on Saturday that by this or by Monday we will have justice Brett Kavanaugh\nAre sitting on the United States Supreme court\nSo I ... a ... you think that'd be those are senators who may have been wavering before may have been wavering I'm a now they're going to be a swayed by this investigative report which does not which backs basically backs them up\nI think one of the the the report they wanted to see the additional witnesses and it just goes through testified out in the Senate committee\nOr be taught to the FBI went through that process or the story is the same as we knew going into it and so if for folks like Senator Collins Senator Murkowski possibly Senator Flake\nOr you know hopefully will make them more comfortable and in that the judges Barry strong denials of these allegations as their leveled against him and I think he makes it much more likely that he will be a voted on ... for a over the weekend\nAnd that's going to really took off the Democrats you know that don't you I mean really I Love\nYou know here's the thing and you know and you've probably seen the video is well this afternoon knows protesters built the heart Senate office building and the thing I've got to ask and I and I remember get built back to ... jet Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and when she was confirmed with like Ninety five Ninety six votes\nIf I remember correctly including most Republicans you\nClearly did not agree with her politics but found her to be overly qualified\nIf you're one of those left of center you know they used to call them blue dog Democrats as you look to see how the Democrat Party has been taken over by\nRadical resistance forces and socialists it's just not the Democrat Party that that many people use to to identify with I see you see that happening in the polls now where the congressional generic ballot that you know bellwether indicator has gone from double digits\nA month ago in favor of Democrats too there was one out today that has that different than being just two points so Republicans are being activated and I think even many middle of the road folks are just looking at the circus\nAnd and saying that's not what our politics or to be about\nAnd they see what they've done to this man and his family and\nUh and I think the uh the vote will indicate that on the on Saturday\nThe other party of Henry scoop Jackson and JFK that party is gone very\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLet's see among people who believe that government needs to take a better than uh than what we have seen in the circus Spartacus moments and and the other displays that we have seen in recent weeks and I think that's one of the reasons why now they're second guessing their own which is from Democrats and\nThey just want they were going to see that things play out and hopefully you'll see that justice cabin on Monday\nYou know last week Senator Flake said let's extends for one week\nAnd Democrats are rallied around him a day later they said it wouldn't be enough time and they keep saying that the the FBI should investigated a Ford and I'm In Kavanaugh is well well when when she was asked\nAt the end of her statement do you have anything else than anything else to say she said no nothing at all so\nI'm not sure why they again I think it's more obfuscation from the Democrats but I'm not sure why they should have interviewed Kavanaugh or forward again and I think that they probably went above ... on what would have been really reasonable\nI think you're absolutely right and and you know we shouldn't forget\nThat the doctor for was able to make her opening statement tell her story exactly is how she wanted to tell it to include the details that she thought were necessary to be included then she went underwent hours of questioning from from both parties\nAre the same thing happened with judge Kavanaugh's they were under oath under the penalty or your each and so I'm not sure what would have been gained be to interview them just again\nIt sets to draw out the process even longer and continue to to delay I mean you even seen a lot of calls from Democrats today that they want people who weren't even potential witnesses\nTo be interviewed just people who heard of things from other people being told by other people you know third for ... hand accounts again trying to delay trying to create this narrative that the people\nThat a that a thorough investigation wasn't done and I said it on Twitter earlier today when Senator Blumenthal was talking about white washes cover ups\nBy the FBI\nFlash back a couple of months ago weren't the Democrats and all of their brands of ran on cable news just\nRepeating hours of breathless in hysterical commentary about how anyone who question the FBI is tearing apart the fundamental principles about the rule of law and the foundations of our democracy and now here they are doing it when it they think it suits their me\nNow that's absolutely that's absolutely true and of course a Dr Ford gave her uh her testimony in ... in Washington

expected maybe three hundred people out there there are police out there or what's going to go on these Tea Party people are they going to what are they going to do ... you know what we didn't have three hundred people\nWe had between three and four thousand people turned out you have any police cars people relieve themselves on like the left who had left us that they're going to ... you know how many none\nYou know how many how many fights there were zero\nYou only problems occurred arrests or anything like that none it was orderly we also spoke and Herman Cain smoke and it was
