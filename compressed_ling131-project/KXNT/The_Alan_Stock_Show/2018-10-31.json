day President Trump in full stumped traveling the country and campaigning for his fellow Republicans in Congress it goes without saying there's a lot on the line when Americans go to the polls on November sex\nAnd they're saying this now listen to this this is interesting again this whole search thing they want to start a year in schools in Clark County students actually must consent to be searched\nSo let's say they became random number\nIn schools the Clark County students actually must consent to be searched so let's say they began random number generator picks five of the fifth one they say we're going to search you\nYou have to consent to it if you don't sign a consent to it you're subject to a school discipline\nThat's what they say so I think the more I read into this the more convoluted it became the more convoluted it became\nSo the district um\nIn Clark County is referring to a policy that they use of the LA Unified School district which requires secondary schools to conduct daily random metal detectors searches and that policy as you can well imagine is drawn opposition from the ACLU naturally\nAnd they've been pushing for an end of this practice\nRepresented the ACLU of Southern California says we really see schools as spaces that should be safe supportive and welcoming spaces for students to learn and we think the policies like LA's policy and potentially Clark county's policy a road that kind of spirit in goal that we have for schools\nThat's from the idiots at a CEO you\nAnd I say that because you know that's nice to have a safe supportive and welcoming space for students learn tell me something a show you how do you make the school's safe\nUnless you are at an initiate some extraordinary\nMeasures again to those in a second okay\nAnyway they're saying in LA they ... on a random basis they really know guns recovered and Thirteen fourteen and you know it's not really as effective as you might think\nOne parent or\nSaid that I'm saying so the initiative maybe opened a lot of problems particularly with racial tensions agents that are used for a zero tolerance policy for weapons found a school a woman that expel students on the first\nOffense because parents need to be held accountable for their students and\nUh so let me just tell you what they're doing at one school or Sierra Vista I saw this on the news I think it was last night the service the high school\nThey viewed a front gate buzzer\nThat requires visitors to use an audio and video door buster it into the school so when you go to the ... the gate\nBefore because the schools gated off that's them or what smart move or that you have to buzz in and then they look at you okay and then once you get in they've they've driven you're okay then they have to go and I didn't like kid bad system that will print\nVisitor badges if the visitors on campus for a parent teacher conference or other reason than involves the president's inside the school they'll be asked to be run through this id system okay so let me just say you know I really thought this\nI really thought this was initially I came out I said okay you know find let's let's give these random searches going to make things safer every thought this I don't think random searches are going to make anything safe\nI don't think they're going to make anything safe I think they're complete absolute total waste of time\nI mean that sincerely I Do believe I Do believe in mandatory I'm\nHaving a every student goes through a metal detector on the way in\nEvery single school\nI'm having a every student goes through a metal detector on the way in\nEvery single school should have a metal detector should have a fences around it high fences with the tops of the fence is pointing out you can't climb over it and then I Would have every kid go through a metal detector\nOr that would be elementary school to remember that kid that brought the school was going to school or loose or one of the young kids yeah elementary middle school high school all go through metal detectors if you buzz off as you know gene you know to do that then they have the right\nTo have you searched by member of your own sex okay I I Would do that\nMandatory mandatory metal detectors and the right to search every single student who buses off in that I'm a ... in a metal detector\nThat's the only way we're going to make it absolutely fair everybody across the board everybody goes through a metal detector just like you do when you go to a Dodgers game I don't care what gate you go in

show appreciate your coming I Want to thank you very much for joining us You're welcome um the ah\nThis I got to ask you one of the question connected with salt Pittsburgh thing just from your point of view because you're you've been a law enforcement official I all your life so you know you understand it from a certain perspective the shooter in Pittsburgh a purchases guns legally\n... it was a he had on him a um he was carrying a glock three fifty Seventy hadn't had three of them three clock thrifty sounds in a are Fifteen assault rifle he had a um\nSeveral more guns at home or rifles shotguns and ... as car and things like that so the guy was you know and again he had no history where you couldn't buy these things legally\nThere are people out there who are saying that we should uh restrict people one that are having problems like this from buying guns and two we should restrict certain guns from being able to be purchased like assault weapons and they never quite defined with assault weapons are only your thought on both of those things one is how do you\nAnd I I've been thinking about this ever since Saturday how do you prevent how do you anticipate someone is going to buy a gun and then do with this guy did or what God Forbid the guy did hear a October one of last year I mean ... ... ... you have a clean record which these people do how do you anticipate something like that\nUm well I guess that's the proverbial question now and it's you know a lotta times\nUs on the law enforcement side would never be warned or be aware of these individuals because like you said they had no interaction in the past but individuals close to them are probably savvy to this individuals' change a behavior mental state\nYou know some tragic event has occurred in their life that would cause them to go off the deep end per se um so that's why we always say you know see something say something we rely on other people to help us and evaluating these individuals and quite often it would be something as simple as we go out to talk to them\nAnd get an assessment on whether we think they intend on harming somebody or not\nUm sometimes we're successful that sometimes were not you know 'cause we're not obviously you know license practitioners in psychology and things like that but it's\nYou know it it's pretty successful in that in that endeavor for us to get some kind of insight and these individuals but like you said if we're not aware of it um is so is there are some kind of policy or mechanism on the back and that would help us or assist us\nIn that endeavor and you know where you get to things like background checks and you said this person purchased the guns legally ... but we're all the guns purchased legally in other words ... you know like the uh private private party sale question that was part question one in the previous legislature\nUm should individuals with private party sales have their backgrounds done because\nYeah you're purchasing it legally but you may be selling it to somebody that's been due to cater to have mental disability rights so [noise]\nUm unless it's gone through the form of fashion of the court system in those different things that you're not aware of so I guess the answer to your question is the highest percentage of success would be some individual that's close to these individuals to warn us of this person's intent to commit harm\nAnd and I have no issue with a background checks on through a lot of background checks myself a and I am a I have no issue with that whatsoever I Do um my objection to the question one that was on the ballot\nOf background checks myself a and I am a I have no issue with that whatsoever I Do\nUm my objection to the question one that was on the ballot happen to be when you have a father wanted to give his son has gone a then you'd have to run a background check or if the example was that a year going to ah you're you're you're in the national guard and you're being a mobilized to go overseas\nAre and you give your gun to your uncle to to you know to to hold it for you\nYou have to run a background check on your uncle when you come back\nHe would have had to run a background check on you so I mean really became a little bit laborious are ridiculous I think they made the ... there were some definite issue is connected with that\nYeah but I I Believe that some of those circumstances you describe wasn't the first to ration um that failed where the governor vetoed it and then subsequent legislative session they identify those kind of particular situations you know family members and all that and they made exemptions for several different situations\nAnd there's it eventually fail because they included the FBI conducting the check\nAnd they don't have the ability to do that with all of the language was flawed and how they would conduct the checks\nI agree with that that was that was the ... that was the big problem people blame the governor and the attorney general and this was a flawed language if they want to come back and fix it that would be a whole other story on\nThe Internet you know in in one of the biggest issues on that Alan was you know people were afraid that you were denying them to the right to the second amendment and in order to bear arms and\nAnd I'd have to push back a little bit on that and you know nobody's denying nobody's coming to get your weapons and nobody is denying you from attaining a weapons were just asking you to to you know procedure legal through a couple of steps in order to do that that's all [noise]\nUm but again I I go on driver's license go drive a car you know\nBut I have lots of background checks I ... I mean as anybody object to that in order to have to get a a ... to buy guns they they run a background check on you or something or I mean I got I I Know what it's got cw of the same way a lot of background right actually run I so\nI mean the the second part of that question you had mentioned about automatic weapons in the west and it's got to be defined\nBetter before they make that leap you know exactly what that looks like and what it's going to entail and how will that affect your ability to um possessive farm so there's a lot of questions to answer on that before they can make that leap\nThere are as you point out there like three hundred million guns in society somewhere but you don't have to be in a million people or or whatever it is we have in this country you know using those guns are ... and in the various way every day you have some people who are uh have problems like this guy or in a in Pittsburgh\nThe guy maybe you want to identify the guy who was studying the those little pipe bombs out that people still like that I mean these people are disturbed individual people write these are not the average running a ... a citizen here\nI mean and that doesn't happen overnight this guy has interaction with the individuals on a daily basis just like any one of us and you can't tell me there wasn't somebody out there that sit in\nThe sky just makes me nervous or just doesn't seem right now I'm In law enforcement we asked you to reach out nothing is to mundane are benign for us to at least look into it so\nAnd those things we have to consider but then you look at the other individuals you know\nI'm\nAn elderly gentleman here recently lost his life [noise]\nUm to a guy on a hot proud in other words the guys like breaking into his house and the homeowner presented his weapon and the suspect took the weapon away and shot him with it [noise]\nUm so those are the situation where you know gun ownership is a huge responsibility and and I always condone that individual\nAnd shot him with it um so those are the situation where you know gun ownership is a huge responsibility and and I always condoned individuals are properly trained and have the ability to protect themselves rather than just possession of gun\nUm you know it's really easy to purchase a gun but would you know what to do with it and do you understand the the safety mechanisms are to secure you know weight from kids and things like that you know you saw this\nUm this is a two year old kid shot a four year old here recently and you know and so those are the kinds of things that are in the back of my mind hoping people a\nPractice responsible gun ownership\nWell I'm with you a hundred percent so I Would just be you said so far so good to know rare but rarely disagree with something while you're shooting for about a common sense about seven three three ... three three five nine six eight Sheriff Joe Lombardo joining us in Studio and I wonder when those lines to you

and four percent on entertainment what's in your wallet terms applied capital one bank usa NA\nIt does complex both but you know you also have to keep in mind it's not the um [noise]\nThe end all answer of everything that we do because just like in any other surveillance video see or anything there might be a different angle that you're not privy to that that causes us to act we react so it's not the answer to everything but it is provides us some information to base our opinions on\nWhat's especially if you have two or three officers out there and they each have body cameras and you see somebody from a different perspective going back to you and I talked about the other parents Rio depending on reading reading writing seeing and so you have that person may be\nAble to session and the weapon that you don't see me as a camera in the public you know forms of uninformed opinion on that so it's good it's just another tool for our success\nYou mentioned by the way the ... and and so you just do something I did not know a few minutes ago that the the elderly gentleman who was shot by the intruder who was breaking down fences or whatever the ... the power um that that that gun was his was the was it was was the older gentleman was not the ... gun\nCorrect and that's the way we see is the evidence is presented itself up to date and that's where we are basing our opinion on so yes it was his weapon or they we believe he was engaged in a struggle over the weapon and subsequently removed from the victim and shot him with it so\nI'm I'm fortunate and you know he's he had obviously had a weapon to protect himself but you know and that's why we go back to what I said if you have to have the ability to properly use in safely use it other than that it can be a weapon gets used against you so\nSo if anything at all there may be a possibility might hesitate you've got to think twice about even pulling it out in the first places where I either either either if you're going to pull it out you've got to be willing to use it and and God Forbid you have to but if you if you do at least ... you know you you know you've got that wherewithal\nRight exactly you know and I said it a thousand times I said we us police officers you know\nWe trained several times a year with the ... men and thousands upon thousands of hours of abuse of the weapon and we get it wrong sometimes so it's very important for people to understand the responsibility goes along with it so\nMe about a about the ah crime in the community in general some people say that it's increased and we're\nSo tell me about a about the ah crime in the community in general some people say that it's increased and we're on the increase generally speaking of and nationally in Las Vegas and in general are what are your stats and what do you see\nYou know in general across the nation there has been an increase in particular to violent crime a property crimes has been pretty flat across the nation but here locally\nWe experienced a uptick um and I guess it would be three years ago\nUm but since then in the last two years is we're on a decline so if you look at today's numbers violent crime is down right around nine percent compared to last year and property crimes down around two two to three percent compared to last year so we're going in the right direction [noise]\nUh what we're doing and the Billy higher police officers and the programs were put into place and being proactive versus reactive which it's bearing fruit\nAnd I'm a ... I\nMean dissipate the trend will continue to to decline and that's a good thing um so\nAre you are a lot of perception is because we have all these mechanisms and tools to receive information nowadays you know like ... you know notify you whenever something happens and\nThe Internet and so there's a perception and plus you're privy to what's going on in other jurisdictions so sometimes it's a perception thing where you think crime is increasing in actuality it is it's going the opposite direction so\nI'm happy to say here in our jurisdiction in our community it's is it isn't is going down its is going down in the school in in the right direction\nBecause people's awareness of because of the technology and and the community policing and everything\nYeah that's all part of it and more importantly the ability to hire police officers we've hired over seven hundred in the past two years so that's a that's a good deal and cops and make a difference and\nThat's all part of it you know I've always said it before our number one to investigative tool and our two boxes Facebook you know a lot of people a lot of things are so because of what people put out on the Internet\nAnd so
