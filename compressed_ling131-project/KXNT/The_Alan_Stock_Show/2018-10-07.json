we are going\nTo just dig in today is everything having to do with entertainment in Las Vegas and I'm so excited about it is my favorite topic we have a very special guest\nRedo yes in in Studio ... today with us leaders Patrick accused the president and CEO of the free month street experience\nAnd like we always do we start today with our hot topic segmented which market I scan the headlines feast on the juicy spats and give our opinions by now you know how great I Am at this segment and how average mark is\nOn a hot topic unlike the Waldorf whereas markets like Wal Mart nothing wrong with that\nBut they're just not in the same league are they so ... what was your big take away from this week in Las Vegas\nWhat else the season has begun are below the Golden Knights are back on the ice the team actually kicks off right now in Minnesota on the road but on Thursday of course they play their season opener against the flyers the good guys of course I couldn't get it done falling ... too\nLook on the civil Patrick thank you so much more so I mean how how do you do the ... how do you make it continually so great downtown\nWell it helps being born in Ireland and because we're lifelong partiers and so it's really natural for us to create a party environment and and that's just part of the job but that really is what we do down there is ready to coot environment for people to have fun\nSo we want to talk about your job so exactly tell us I guess who you are and what you do because you know you're you're you're kind of a behind the scenes kinda guy for being such a high profile human being\nSometimes but then you also see me onstage introducing the acts with a free concerts um all throughout the summer but all throughout the year so it's it's really is an interesting position yet as you said president and CEO of the Freeman street experience\nUh may help to to explain to everyone what that is the the the experience itself which is at six city block entertainment district anchored by are the largest STD screening the world\nAnd uh and it's the most busiest traffic street in Las Vegas and last year at fifty seven percent of the forty two now I'm forty two point nine million people walked down the street last year which acquaintance do about twenty two million people so that's a big parties and all\nThat is absolutely insane um that that is so many people Patrick they do have is a captive audience you know you've been in Vegas twenty two years he just told me correct and with the Nazi three years what brought you to Vegas originally twenty two years ago\nI um I was dealing cards and actual fact at the age of twenty four I was and I was a casino manager and a and I came to Vegas and to settle down because there was no shortage of jobs in the gaming industry and came to Vegas and uh then worked in gaming I ended up running a casinos for six years the last six years\nPrior to the free month street experience around rampart for two years and counter you up north for four\nAnd before this opportunity came along so um but the ... in those casino properties around them as entertainment destinations so it was a great transition to to to go outside of those boxes are down to the free mustard experience\nDo you ever miss gaming you ever miss any of those aspects as being in a casino resort\nKnow very interesting so I'm Still surrounded by\nLiterally yeah and but you know in my mind I'm a I was done within the box their old boxers they're incredible boxes but the same stuff goes on within those boxes and then and then this opportunity came along which is certainly outside of the box and that's why he was a perfect fit for me\nA transition an evolution in my career to to come down to three months\nNow since you've been at free month street experience there than in quite a few\nKind of crazy things that have happened down there in terms of renovations new technology yeah you've got your undergoing presently eighth thirty two million dollar renovation Johnny collapses on her show a few weeks ago\nAnd tipped us off which which caused us to invite you to write down is just off the conversation that he had had with you is a great friend of the show and\nSo there's going to be obviously the canopy is kind of the centerpiece\nOf free month street experience many years ago for people that may not know Fremont was actually a a street that you drove down when I was a little girl we would drive doubt it and many movies TV shows were filmed on that driving straight now it was covered with the campaign\nAnd now we're seeing even a new revolution\n[noise] yes so the Freeman street experiencing this current fashion opened up December first Ninety five I arrived in Vegas\nMarch Ninety six three four months after it opens little did I Know Twenty years later I'll be running the thing [noise] um so it it is anchored by the largest study D screen the world and as you can imagine a ... destroyed the current employees that are there right now uh they're fourteen years old\nSo if you think about your phone were changing these things every two years and we haven't changed the ... and the larger screen in the world and fourteen years were way way way behind the curve\nAs so last year there this year excuse me the biggest accomplishment we did was recreate the public private partnership of funding which built the place in the ... initially\nUm there'll be CVA on the city of Las Vegas and the probably the casino owners downtown have collaborated or to fund this thirty two million dollar upgrade so everyone is vested we did everyone appreciates the destination the importance of this destination to Las Vegas\nSo I'll be completed that funding earlier this year and now the manufacturing of the new entities has become in January will start receiving the new product and about April will start installing the new product\nAnd then what Johnny counts doesn't know is a buying New Years next year we're going to have a party like no other to unveil the new iteration of the free month street experience\nAnd what that is though to serve I could just explain that a little bit the benefits aren't just a brighter screen yeah we're going to quote unquote dribble the resolution on the brightness will be eight times what it is today\nWill be able to broadcast and display twenty four seven so this thing will be living breathing artistic destination not going to be Times Square\nAnd and that's all cool and everything but the key going forward is the interactive components that we're developing people will be able to interact with this through their cell phones and an actual fact the app that we're creating a school the key is going to be the case\nWe're developing people will be able to interact with this through their cell phones and an actual fact the app that we're creating it's called the heat it's going to be the key to the city with the key to the experience everyone has one\nAnd and it's that indoor activity that's going to build the emotional connection to the destination that encourages and guarantees future trips\nThat's what's the importance to to to the destination so we're destination but then a destination and uh that's why everyone is is is is excited about this now it's the next generation it's Jen three as we call them\nSo we're sitting here obviously with a battered he was from the president CEO of Milford experience so the key is quite revolutionary like I mean this is way beyond my ... my mentality my uh my technical technological capability\nBut that's been done before they say is it different I mean is this happening in used in a different format maybe in another city with another destination where did you first become familiarized with this technology\nWe went through a conceptual phase internally and ... and we brought in a creative Brubeck sternly who helped us um create these ideas and and from their experience um you did a interactive aspects I just have been on elsewhere on much smaller scales\nSo it's the scale of this going to be the difference the other technologies are out there um and I give you another example of of what we will be able to do going forward each sports\nThis will be the largest east sports screen in the world\nYou can play video games on this thing that's come it's coming wow [laughter] I mean something minor alone [laughter] so that's pretty incredible I got to think and I I Would just I mean just assume here that the canopy of solve is probably the single biggest I guess the reason people go downtown these days is that right\nAbsolutely correct and through the ugly CVA visitor profile study two thousand Seventeen is the most reasons or Seventy percent of people who came down town came because of the Freeman street experience and the kind of so overwhelming that is the that's the reason they come and it's not just the kind of I Would say to pedestrian eyes\nAspect of downtown now is what is helping us flourish is the kind of activity\nThat you're able to bounce around you have to walk the walk to the container park in the ... museum to the casinos on Freeman street um and that's that's what people want they want to be able to stroll around and and it's affordable which is another major benefit for tourists and locals\nAnd are those the the news the read the ... primary reasons we believe that people come down\nSo I Can't tell you how many times I've been especially on airplanes for some reason when you're full of tours of course\nAnd I hear something the extent of I like old downtown I I like Fremont Israel like I like that way better than the strip you kind of see that downtown there I Would say a happier individual but you see someone downtown who is\nYou know it just feels like they're getting better bang for their buck downtown feel more home downtown on the strip\nUm first of all I'm never going to claim that were better than the strip I those the revenues that those incredible properties and companies generate or off the charts might so it's just a different experience and and and as I said earlier fifty seven percent of all visitors to Las Vegas come downtown at some stage\nWhat's that and we only have five percent of the city's hotel rooms so that means everyone staying on the strip right right which means they choose Las Vegas at a destination because they want as part of their trip to come down town it's actually another reason to choose Las Vegas\nAnd so it's a different experience that's all not better not worse just difference\nSo we've we've talked about very earlier on uh that you are Irish\nAnd so it's a different experience that's all you know better not worse just difference\nSo we've we've talked about very earlier on uh that you are Irish and you know how to have a good time so there is no shortage of bars downtown I oh I Know I'm going to put you on the spot [laughter] and I'm not going to name\nI have your favorite watering hole all I can I hear a segment guy and I am not going to ask for your favorite\n'cause there'll be probably unfair to several 'cause I feel like you probably have gone to several what are your favorite few\nMy top twenty perfect [laughter] out of sight opening narrative added hey thanks very cool bar yes yeah and I have a vested interest in that place that's what I hear I like to bring it up myself though\n'cause there's there are so many with different characters from ... to the Nevada test site which is just open ... seven then Carson corduroy or there's just so much love to given I Try and give them all I Love\nFat very very interesting at eclectic group and I really you know I've actually gone down quite a few times for the whole down a down in\nWatch phenomenal teach people watching yes a very very interesting at eclectic\nGroup and I really you know I've actually gone down quite a few times for the whole down a down in numbers during an F. R. and I do the same thing we're all just get dropped off sort of somewhere and you know end up at ... at at three mile street just see the performances but I kind of stumbled into different places along the way\n... being the operative for us [laughter] I didn't start her stumbling I now ... what was the defining moment for you in two thousand Eighteen is we're kind of heading into the in the twilight of the year what has been two dozen Eighteen for you\nVery simple there's there's one event or two events that occurred all connected to the canopy it was completing that funding agreement 'em and which which you're the money was one aspect of it but knowing that the convention authority and the city of Las Vegas\nAppreciate the destination for what it is on or putting help putting their money behind us\nA ... that that was absolutely by far and that the the best accomplishment and you're just like to talk about that for a second the canopy itself is actually a owned by the city and the street is a city streets and that's where some of the people watching is it a challenging for us\nBecause as I said we're running an entertainment district and we want to make sure that that uh everything out there is appropriate but with it being a public street we have no control over the content of some of those people\nAnd so that's challenging for us and then sometimes disappointing because we want our tourists and locals to come down and and really be impressed with everything that we do so um so it's just a little side note there but the economy is owned by the city and that's where you can justify the city in the convention authority participating\nAnd but also um I work a casino owners as you mentioned uh they realized this is the life blood and that's why they're contributing more than any any of the other parties are to investing into creating this new environment\nNow with the contributions and obviously the strip being so close and this major a transformation happening with the canopy is there a more pressure to really just bring it with the Kennedy this next time\nYeah [laughter] [laughter] yeah absolutely there is um yeah it would have been ... we were never going to do it but I Would have been a serious mistake just to turn on brighter lights and do the same old now we're recreating recreating the experience we've been challenging ourselves to do so and that with some of the idea of the interactive features\nOr a major piece of it but then the content that want to create this living breathing artistic thing when people aren't going to see the same\nImages on there on the screen and when after the grand unveiling New Year's eve next year that are going to come down you're experiencing something different every time and that's that's what we that's our job to do\nAnd I want to clarify New Year's eve of this year or are we talking to a year and a half away doesn't Nineteen okay if Yucca correct just making sure correct gotta get my calendar planned out right now\nThat's where my will be given a remote town they're alive right now with mark of a window has got to get here if you please ...\nPatrick either now Patrick we I at the end of our show we have our our gas from our or magic mind\nYou're so the market Melinda magic ... heat index cards that are delicately folded were actually see the modern have magic question magic areas thought provoking sometimes philosophical sometimes find questions so Patrick please pick one\nLife to be philosophical without a drink in my hands on on the topic uh what do you challenge next time you're bringing talk now for everyone [laughter] Patrick has flip the question oh my word I Can't because the question is uh\n... [laughter] how chicken has what the question\nOh my word I Can't because the question is a talk about my best only in Vegas story we've had this before\nI wouldn't even know where to start and one of my word uh let's start off with and my first experience in Fremont St John yes I I had never been to Vegas before and uh moved here without ever having seen the city and I chose I come from a city so I chose the heart of the city\nAnd um which ended up being downtown and I got an a cab at the airport and went straight straight downtown and stayed a on a on a classy placement of this is twenty two years ago or was it was it was a motel ... days in I Believe\nAnd uh and then walked Freeman street I didn't realize the kind of he was a three months old at the time\nI didn't even realize the strip existed for the first six months of my time in Las Vegas which is quite crazy then I found a thing and I'm like wow look at that and not have not hilarious story another controversial one but that's the one I'm sticking to for now I Love that\nVery PC barrier BC or maybe I can see things will get we might make we we're gonna make 'em do another one for that answer and get in there and do hello at heart of\nThe other ones I what I look forward to this fall into what what is in the concert here looking forward to ...\nHours a massive one mighty mighty Bostonians as you said twenty first of October ...

this episode is about all of that and not just about an ordinary topic but an extraordinary topic what is it the universe\nIs a big place and no better person can help us learn about that that Neil DeGrasse Tyson astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York City which means we were just discussing this\nHis keys to the planetarium his keys to the universe\nSo there you go that's not a bad get Neal great to have you with us\nActually is a key fob fall through the universe and there's very few things in life better than it was off to the university it's good to have you think ... or ...\nAnd Yorkshire concept right away and you should also know that I get to eat you get to eat okay that's good you are invited to eat and you will enjoy I Hope eating what ... ... you'll you'll get to do the talking August due to talking all get to watch or then you'll talk you know he'll get to watch that a horror show if there ever was one\nThat Jo this is Neil DeGrasse Tyson\nA renowned and much\nAlive now they had a second category which I think those are the names of the sexiest dead astrophysicist but he was a sexy is living one so there you go well\nThat was first Eighteen years ago [noise] um in second I bet you're still compared to ... I Know I don't think it was a competitive category I don't know who I built out of it even ... I don't know [laughter] I don't know who I don't know I have plus the categories never repeated so [laughter] I may once\nIs enough okay I guess I retired the category they got like ... [laughter]\nSo let's start our conversation you've got a brand new book out accessory to war the subtitle is fascinating the unspoken alliance between astrophysics and the military were going to get into that I Want to get into climate science\nBut I also just want to start with some basic construct for my audience mhm about what you do what the universe has told us what we've learned about it in the last ten to Twenty years let's start there you\nMost of my family they never graduated high school so I'm trying to break that barrier my daughter Brooklyn was also motivation for me to go back to school every day after work went straight to school and it paid off\nAt age twenty second Corinne my school diploma\nIf I could not have done it alone I see the future is really\nNo one can Malone and if you were thinking of your high school diploma\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to

enough to merely have than American\nPresidents in space we must have\nAmerican dominance in space so important\nVery importantly I'm here by directing the department of defense Pentagon to immediately began the process necessary to establish a space force as these six branch of the armed forces that's a big stake\nI made sure that President Trump talking about the space force June Eighteenth twenty Eighteen near the grass Tyson as our special guest astrophysicist newer and see we're all things universal more about the universe because most all the cool stuff that is out\nThere ... being being thank you Mr President [laughter] ... somethings all things [laughter] you know science I've read them off in the universe precisely yes and thank you Jamie\nOr I Want to play you a soundbite from one of our earlier episodes we had the massive ministry to Jim ... the new one yes as our guest July tenth twenty Eighteen here's what he said about\nSpace as we interact with it not and that sort of philosophical political way we were talking about in the first segment but much more practical way Jamie that's number one plate please\nOur very way of life is dependent on space\nThe way we navigate the way we communicate over the horizon communications\nThe way we produce food the way we produce energy or the way we do disaster relief in fact the way we do banking and the United states of America if we lose the GPS signals there are no interbank transfers that means there'll be no milk in the grocery store our way of life shuts down\nAnd and that's why hostile countries around the world\nAre taking action to make these capabilities vulnerable to the United states of America\nAnd it is that you know the Chinese have called space the American Achilles' heel and you know the president is getting these same brief and he said you know what we're taking it up and not the time has come I think he's right uh and of course I've voted on it multiple times in the house of representatives\nSo near the grass Tyson two part question first a that was a prelude to a conversation that we had with Jim pride and Stein about the space force which will get you on a second but in general is his description about our practical either dependence on oil reliance to space\nAccurate understanding it's an understatement yes please expand well no way I mean he knows the full extent and he was just starting to list okay so almost everything we care about\nIn modern civilization that we think of as modern civilization is today enabled magnified or distributed or contributed to buy space assets\nAnd in a way that is I mean beautifully invisible to us we just go on and you're getting you withdraw money from the ATM you you just do these things and you're not even thinking about it and so\nSo [laughter] there's the old saying ... probably apocryphal the person who doesn't want to invest in space or because they just want to stay on\nThe campaign I I don't know but if people think they don't need it when in fact their life depends on it there's a mismatch there what's an asset in space you use that phrase well so a space asset would be let's start with the GPS satellites watched by the air force\nCo opted by the rest of us and GPS stands for global positioning system that yeah I I don't think the essay for satellite I think that's a system that I like the ... definitely the GPS global positioning rice and it is a system satellites that provides for coordinates for you\nYou would want you to your attitude your altitude and your time\nThis is very important oh by the way a completely obscure fact the GPS satellites are so high up that they're in a significantly different gravitational field of earth than we are\nAnd I started to general theory of relativity prescribes that if you're in a lower gravitational field time we'll take more faster for you than it will\nIf you're in a higher gravitational field so the time kept by GPS satellite has to be corrected for general theory of relativity before it sends a signal back down to us and we know precisely how much corruption that is\nA really obscure fact but I had the threat that's fantastic yes and and how was that program how do we know what that differential is oh 'cause you can calculate what the strength of the gravity is at the orbiting aptitude got a safe that some and then you engineer back you'd have to medically reverse engineer that to what time difference it would take\nBecause time is not absolute it's relative according to [laughter]\nAs someone who works in a business that has built at least conceptually around precise timing I Know it's also precise but also incredibly relatives\nRelative and hence the theory of relativity but anyhow so you've got to these GPS satellites that we have co opted for our industry for businesses\nFor it not only help traditional businesses like shipping to keep track of their trucks and cars you can follow where they are on earth find out if they know the diabolical side of that as you can track how long the coffee break to\nExactly [laughter] that's right [laughter] it it pursuit of hyper efficiency you know it's now a seven and a half minute coffee break exposed to a twelve minute ... so that's like\nThe downside of that but um so but in addition you shouldn't think of the value of the satellites themselves they each have a Costa engineering costs to building to launch and to maintain but that's not the actual value the value is what does it enable down here on earth\nHundreds of billions of dollars and commerce is enabled by that so if you have a military that traditionally protect your borders or protect you from someone who wants to fight you you might also want them to protect your assets\nAnd to protect your assets would be a fundamental part of what it is to be a sovereign country right and so so so you have your GPS on it then you have your weather satellites you have your communication satellites throw in direct TV there as well this is part of\nA world of business that require space for it to even exist at all you said this is invisible to us largely is it crowded up there there are some crowded places the geosynchronous orbit all place is twenty three thousand miles above the earth\nAnd you can only orbit above the equator at that distance why because I look satellites in orbit low they they take one trip in Ninety minutes around the earth the higher up your orbit is the longer that trip takes could take two hours two and a half hours five hours ten hours\nWait a minute for Arthur C Clark is there a height where it takes so long that takes exactly twenty four hours to go around the earth\nWhat height is that if you found that high to put a satellite there than it would orbit earth at the same rate that earth rotates that's geosynchronous yes you can actually more specific\nThe stationary that okay so you could basically Parker satellite over the earth\nIn a single spot so now park one over the Atlantic between North America and Europe\nNow you can be missing go up to it and beam it back down across the curvature of the earth just as a administered by disdain that referenced you could you could communicate beyond the curvature of the earth by the way a flat earth or could never be head of NASA genetic or would that wouldn't work right around\nThat would that that that line on the resume would disqualify ...\nJobs for you if you want the earth is flat that's just not one of them [laughter] so so I just F why are you so Arthur Clarke wrote a paper on this and it became the foundation\nOf our communication satellites word it so that is one distance one hide in one place and that is crowded and that the British crowded then there's other places space is pretty empty but still you have to be careful\nBecause we have a what we have thousands of satellites up there and more being added all the time and not all of them are taken out\nOkay be it'd be something different if you can sort of vacuum up the bad ones are the ones that are dead or the ones that broke or or or collect the debris left over the Chinese Tomahawk doubt a satellite\nWe're going to get to that that is a ... or what we call it geezer last or if it's real the grass I didn't even know he was on your eyes are ... China talk taking something out of the sky debris space force all of that coming up major gear or this is the take outward tupelo honey in Arlington, Virginia lunches and roots\nAnd we're happy happy happy to be learning at this table right now [noise]\nBefore we go to break it's time to learn more about this week's restaurant with Nikki no less you knows all sees all when it comes to DC area restaurants by now you know I ordered ... below honeys Schumer see 'em live but that's of course only one item on the menu Nikki take it away and tell us more about what you below honey has to offer\nIt says that if you want to ... up in space it's the end of all your space assets even if you're targeting your enemy so space as far as I can project for it will always be sort of one of reconnaissance\nThe militarization of space has been around since the sixties if you include the constant in your concept of militarization the role of intelligence gathering we've got spy satellites ever since we've had satellites that's not a new thing\nI that is the militarization of space 'cause it enables command and control decisions on earth that are much higher precision and accuracy\nThis is a great way to get to all we'll start with probably a conceptual conversation about space for some more specific one because that leads into your book accessory to war space force Jim ... administrator when he was here said\nIt sounds brand new it sounds like something we've never considered before he talk this through how in Congress it had been discussed in under a different name and under a different construct tell me your evaluation of the space force as a concept and as a either achievable or should not be achievable goal for the United states\nI remember recommending a space wars in two thousand and one on a twelve member commission to which I had been appointed by George W. Bush\nTo serve as a ... to to explore why the u._s. aerospace industry was on hard times it was a commission specifically task to understanding what would happen if we let the aerospace industry just go the way it was headed\nIt would be it was a going out of business sale at that time the Cold War was over the\nWeekend in competition from Airbus embrace air other sort of aviation I'm a giants and the world so what what's going on because if we lose our aerospace industry then we lose our control over our own we lose our own um\nUh what's the word your own destiny does it work without it forgetting losing in at the moment um you you lose your you lose your own access to your\nTransportation right through your security and to your Congress\nOkay so\nI'm In there I remember saying well why don't we separate out the space force from the air force these are two different\nRegimes of our ... of of of of military interest\nOne involves finding a vacuum that you know everything is different and people said well we got this the air force guy said we got this because there's us space command under the air force I said okay I'm not going to proceed you OK I'm OK I don't have a horse in Israel like alright it's your bureaucracy exactly zero [laughter] so\nBut if you want to create a space wars\nMost of it is sort of an accounting shift all of the space activities that we have conducted since the sixties had been under the umbrella of the air force you just pull it out and now to space wars I Want to throw in some extra things and that's what I like I like protect us from rogue asteroids marijuana\nI call that defense that's a good one because that protects us from going acts\nOkay and one would think a high priority I Would think I'm also a like I said earlier why not have them look after the space debris ... if I were to just add to the portfolio or whatever we designated they should think about\n'em so it's not a crazy idea a lot of Trump haters want to hate everything that comes out of Trump's well I'm an academic I ... I analyze everything and just because it came out of Trump's mouth doesn't automatically mean it's a crazy idea evaluated okay so\nSo so that would be a space for it and it's and we have precedents for this\nThe second World War the air force was a branch of the army right it was called the army air force and then we realized you know guys you know the soldiers for the air force but I got to be pilots and the engineers have to be aerodynamic says\nThey're not fixing tanks were fixing a whole different kind of thing and the command and control is different and off the needs vis the survival conditions so no one today questions the value of having had an independent Airforce right\nSo I'm imagining in the future we have a space wars and no one really questions that part of me however wonders whether this was just I got to keep up with the rescues because they have a space for us it was always a little bit of that there's always some competitive as they're\nNear the ... is our special guest we are continuing to learn and happily now eat our fantastic lunch you were to below hunted cafe in Arlington, Virginia I major Garrett back in just a second\n[noise]\nAdmitted you probably want to eat healthy but getting enough organic fruits and vegetables into your diet every day is not only time consuming and expensive\nThat's why in Texas super food we've created a blend of the best USDA organic vine ripe and fruits and vegetables powerful enzymes in probiotics and energizing herbs all in a convenient capsule or powder we call it Texas super food complete organic\nHigh on natural pathway Dr Denis black and I invented Texas super food almost Twenty years ago with one goal in mind\nTo help people like you really busy lives get the all natural nutrition at every one of us needs and deserves so if you can't laundry or don't eat all your guinea fruits and vegetables everyday Texas super food complete organic makes eating healthy easy\nSee our full line of quality nutritional products attacks to super food dot com or call us\nAt eight five five Texas fifty five that's eight five five Texas fifty five Texas super food dot com\nHave you ever thought about saying goodbye to your job just walking into your Boston saying I quit and how would you like to commute to work without ever leaving your home\nWell not long ago at thirty nine year old entrepreneur from a billionaire family spent twenty million dollars in three years to find the best home based business in North America he researched Seventy different companies and when he found the only one that had a real long term potential he bought it\nIn right now he's looking for people to help him turn this company into his next billion dollar success story\nSo if you're serious about making money from home without having to leave your home will grab a pen because I'm about to give you the address of a website where you can learn all about this unique in rare opportunity write this down W.

ever\nHave you have somebody come out and tell you that you needed to replace your furnace or air conditioning system\nI interviewed a guy one time who said that the company that he worked for required him to try to sell new heating and cooling equipment to customers whose heating and air conditioning systems or two and three and four years old\nOh look I don't care how in efficient they claim your heating and air conditioning system is\nIf it's less than eight years old you shouldn't even be having the conversation\nHow about your energy bills do you have energy bills to just keep going up and up and up did you replace your air conditioning system maybe or your furnace and not see the energy savings that you were promised\nI Want to talk to those of you out there who have a furnace or air conditioner or heat bump that six or eight years old and you've been told to junk it in\nLifetime I can count on one hand how many six year old systems that I've seen that needed to be replaced\nMost of the time they just needed a really good cleaning it's going to take you years to get your money back out of a new air conditioning system do you have six or eight grand just lying around that you want to Chuck it your heating and cooling system or would you rather spend just ...\nGetting it cleaned up operating more efficiently\nLower your energy bills viewer breakdowns and more money in your pocket now we're gonna talk a little bit about what you should expect from the heating and air conditioning company that's coming out to maintain your system because\nI've got a feeling that a lot of you out there have been getting the drive by maintenance you'll recognize it it's the one where they come out for twenty to forty five minutes ask you for fifty sixty Seventy bucks and then they're\nGone maybe they hook up a set of refrigerant gauges maybe not if somebody's not spending at least Seventy five to Ninety minutes you need to get somebody else\nA climate control experts to not usually takes between Seventy five two hundred and twenty minutes from start to finish now we call that cleaning or tuna a total system rejuvenation\nAnd it includes cleaning your outdoor coils and inspection and documentation of about sixty to Seventy different components in your furnace and air conditioner\nSome of you are going sixty Seventy different components that's a lot of stuff right\nWell when our guys show up and he's spending an average of Seventy five to a hundred and twenty minutes working to get your heating and air conditioning system as close to factory fresh condition as possible not to mention their criminal background checks and drug screen to\nDid you know that the number one and number two trades being taught in the prisons today we're plumbing and air conditioning\nThat's right folks the number one and number two trains being taught in the prisons today are plumbing in air conditioning\nNot listen folks I'm not saying that I don't believe that people deserve a second chance I really do believe that if you made a mistake and you did time for it when you get out you should be able to get a job\nI just decided I wasn't going to put them in your home now fellas if your wife's going to be the one that's on when the heating and air conditioning guy comes by do you want to take a chance at that person is someone who learned heating and cooling in the pen\nDo you have kids how 'bout them did you know the fifty percent of the guys that I have interviewed can't pass a nationwide criminal background check\nFolks I went through over one hundred resumes and a period of three weeks and only hired one person climate control experts they're very selective about who they put in your own\nI Want to talk about one of the gentlemen I interviewed and keep in mind when I Do an interview I asked them all kinds of questions about how they do the work\nI asked them how to test the capacitor how to clean the blower wheel and sure enough this guy was giving me pretty good explanations he missed one maybe two little steps but nothing a little training couldn't fix right\nNow at some point in every interview I Try to compare our moral compasses so sometimes I gotta get a little sneaky okay so here's the seventh question I asked him\nI lean in and I said how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need\nThis year that folks how do you feel about selling customers things they don't need now brace yourself folks because without hesitation he said I don't have a problem with it at all I don't have a problem with it at all\nThe the reality is that he had been around and worked for enough other air conditioning companies in the area that operated that way that he thought that that's what I wanted to hear\nYou might have a pending compressor failure because you've got this little starter that's about to go bad\nYou might have a pending motor failure because you've got to filter that's all plugged

that is known to crack and to leak carbon monoxide\nDo you see now why I say that you have\nAnd inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe are going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine we're going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there's if you have them let you know how your filters look and advice you whether or not there's something more time or\nCost effective at the end of the day it's about making you more comfortable in your home and

something that way too many people overlook okay and that's what's in the air in our homes you hear a lot of talk about air pollution and air quality and the environment right\nBut did you know that the environmental protection agency the EPA says that the air in our homes is often more polluted than the air of the largest cities in the United states\nAnd with all the time and energy that we spent trying to clean up the environment to ensure that were breathing clean air\nPeople often ignore their own homes the air and your own home is where we get exposed to things like molds and bacteria and allergens and chemicals so how does the\nHomes get polluted well some of the chemicals that we find in our air\nAre from things like cleaning products underneath their sink plastics look at all the stuff in your house that's made a plastic all of that stuff actually off gases or releases chemicals into your air for years\nPaints everybody's got paint on the wall right that stuff off gases that's our they've got the OC free paints nowadays\nThere's glues there's pressed woods there's furniture all that stuff made with chemicals in it\nThan there are the molds and allergens that come into our homes from outside through doors and windows and\nUnsealed air ducts and when you go out side mold attaches itself to your clothing\nEven your pets Sherry mold spores in to the house with them okay and the worst part is that it can and almost always does grow in our homes\nAnd most people don't realize that your air conditioner doesn't bring new air into your house but then it just constantly recycles the same old air that's already in your home\nThat means that if there are chemicals and molds and pollutants in the air they're going to just keep re circulating unless you have something in place to remove them\nThey are just magically going to disappear or right\nAnd the air in your home can circulate over a hundred times per day through your air conditioning system which means that all of the pollutants just keep circulating for you and your family to keep breathing in\nThis can lead to major major health problems overtime I said it before and I'll say it again if you don't have a good filter for your air or your air conditioner\nYou become the filter\nThink about that you either filter the air with your lungs or you get a good filter you choose\nSo let's focus on the molds and the allergens that are found in the air okay because the fact of the matter is that it's common for us to find a combination of things in your air conditioner\nLast time I checked there were twenty two registered strains of mold and while all twenty two are considered allergens and you can have side effects from them right seven of them are toxic okay so what are the side effects and breathing mold\nObviously everyone's different but here's just a fraction of the list of side effects that we're able to find we're talking about things like upset stomachs weight gain fatigue loss of sleep\nNight sweats headaches rashes sore throats coughing I allergies there's lots of taste loss of smell auto immune disorders or sexual side effects and let's not forget about depression\nPeople often experience allergy like symptoms not realizing that the air that they're breathing in their homes is the main problem so what\nAre people doing to remove these molds and allergens from the air that circulating over and over and over again in their home\nWhile there are a few different methods but the one most common method and the most effective is using ultra violet light okay so let's talk about these ultraviolet lights have you guys heard about these things well the first guy\nSurvive it light was meals fenced in back in Nineteen oh three and Neal's won the Nobel Prize for his work using ultraviolet lights to treat tuberculosis\nAnd because of Neal Simpsons work ultraviolet light has since become the gold standard and it's used in many different ways in the medical field okay it's used to sterilize the air and hard surfaces and pretty much every hospital throughout the United states\nUltraviolet light is used to sterilize water if you have a well you might actually use it to sterilize the well from bacteria there used to sterilize food and for the last twenty five years or so ultraviolet light has been used in residential home heating and air conditioning systems\nWhy\nBecause of ultraviolet lights unbelievable ability to destroy the nasty stuff we were just talking about things like molds and bacteria is that take up residence in your home heating and air conditioning system\nAnd guys mold is bad for you if you didn't get that from what we are talking about before the environmental protection agency says that if you know or suspect that you have mould and your heating and air conditioning system that you shouldn't operate the system\nHere the numbers dial quickly because they go quick so\nSeven nine nine nine eight nine nine

you've got to be the first person okay that's clean my teacher dot com oh look I Want to talk a little bit\nAbout the drive by maintenance okay somebody you were sitting there laughing going what's the drive by maintenance well if you have somebody come out to your house for an air conditioning or heating tune up that leaves after only spending thirty forty minutes during a tune up\nFrankly if it's less than Seventy five minutes it's a drive by tune up too\nSo what do you want to do if you got one of those companies\nWell I'll tell you exactly what you do next time they call to schedule the maintenance for you\nAsk them to have the technician give us sixty seconds heads up before he gets to the house a quick telephone call and when you get that telephone call half of your check already written out and just as quickly as you can run up to the end of the rich get richer\nAnd as a technician drives by hold that check out and slap it right in his hand as he drives by okay because you're really getting anything\nAnd in some cases they're doing more harm than good you can't do it to not been twenty thirty or forty minutes okay it's not possible now I'm offering this for Seventy nine dollars today but you only get one shot at it okay at least for the Seventy nine dollars from that point forward\nYou'll see the value in the maintenance and you'll be happy to pay the regular price and if you get set up in one of our maintenance agreements will be able to give you even more discounts and priorities service almost everybody that we see gets one of the maintenance agreements\nThe fact of the matter is that everybody and I mean everybody in the Las Vegas area needs this I mean everybody we all have heating and air conditioning systems and we all want someone we can trust don't we\nWe don't want to replace our heating and air conditioning systems prematurely and that is where we're headed without proper cleaning\nI mean if you don't change the oil and your car what's gonna happen\nIf you don't change the brake pads aren't you going to replace the rotors to\nSame deal folks if you have heating and cooling system it is actually required by the manufacturer if you want to keep the warranty and clean one runs so much better than a dirty one\nI get phone calls from customers all the time my ears blowing a lot harder is that normal well yeah we pulled out your blow or you had as clean it it was all gung top it should be moving more air\nMy furnishing their conditioning system isn't running as much as it was well that was part of the goal we don't want it to run as much that way your energy bills aren't as high end ... D you middle sized properly or humid\nThe season so let's summarize folks real quick so that you know what you're gonna get from a company like climate control experts\nThen I'm going to open up the phone lines again and allows some more people to get that two hundred and fifty two dollar total system rejuvenation for Seventy nine bucks and you're absolutely going to love the service I promise I remember I'm going to give you that Seventy nine bucks back\nOn the way out the door actually going to give you your money back then that crazy amazing\nSo here's the deal we're going to call you and give you a two hour window of time for the technician to arrive\nAfter he parks in the street he's going to walk up and knock on your door and when you let them in he's going to say I'm here to take care of your air conditioner or your for his or your heat pump\nAnd he'll reach down and put on she covers over his shoes or boots we also call them for savers he's gonna wear those each time he enters your house they'll\nShow you the inspection and cleaning form and he'll say something like each of these represents a part of your heating and cooling system and as I'm going through your system I mean they're going to mark okay or if I see anything or it's going to give you challenges in the future I'm On the market and this column over here\nAnd if you want me to take care of something before I leave I usually can now once he has your approval to do the tune up on his own voice they'll ask you to show him the thermostat and with your permission he'll turn it on and make sure that it's working next to ask you to show him the outdoor unit and then the indoor unit\nAt which point he'll say something like I'm going to start your tune up now if you wanna watch that's fine and if not that's okay too and then he'll start the tuna\nNow his very first task is to take the top off of the outdoor air conditioning unit or heat pump\nNext as we get the leaves and sticks in mocking debris out of the system because all that stuff holds water and rushed out the bottom of your air conditioner prematurely\nNext thing you know your compressors falling through the bottom of your unit and you've got to get in the new one okay so something as simple as getting the debris out of the bottom makes a huge difference\nNow the next step in my opinion is the best we're going to use a semi high pressure nozzle to spray down your coils from the inside out because we've got the top off\nNow this is on your outdoor air conditioning unit right\nAnd it sucks air in from the sides and along with it grass clippings and dust and whatnot so we're going to back flush it wash all that gunk back out of there and if you've got all that stuff stuck in your air conditioning system it's just like having a sweater on that baby\nThe number one cause of compressor failure is dirty coils so we're going to get the outdoor coils cleaned up for you\nSometimes we even have to use a foaming cleanser to get all that stuff off and man is that a sight to see you're looking at a good forty five minutes just up to this point so you can see why I say these other maintenance is our drive by maintenance as right if they're there and gone and forty five minutes\nNext we're going to test the electrical components in your system all the connections\nMake sure they're nice in tight makes you you're not getting ready to have any electrical failures or electrical fires\nBecause sometimes little things that go wrong with your air conditioning system and furnish it can cause big things to go wrong All right you may have a pending compressed\nBecause you got a little started that's about to go bad\nYou may have a pending motor failure because you're filters all plugged up and you're not paying attention to it All right so we're going to check all of those little components every part of your system that don't cost that much at all to repair or replace\nNext we're going to check your indoor heating system or from is we'll check the burners your\nPressure switches make sure your exhaust is venting out properly that would be important right\nWe'll check all your hoses your drains you flame sensor and even run a little test on your ignite or to make sure that it's not about to go out on you when it gets cold All right because of that happens your house is going to get cold in a hurry\nMost importantly we're going to check your heat exchange or that's the part that is known to crack and leak carbon monoxide DC now why I say that you have to have these two naps and inspections every six months you don't really have a choice\nWe are going to check the temperature difference between the air coming into your machine and the air going out of your machine\nWe're going to check the duct pressure check your surge protectors your system sterilize there's if you have them let you know how your filters look and advice you whether or not there's something more time or cost effective\nAt the end of the day\nIt's about making you more comfortable in your home and saving money All right so get it tuned up it doesn't cost you anything it actually pays you to do that alright\nGet it cleaned up\nAnd look if you want to experience everything we've been talking about here on the radio without the risk of going in playing Google roulette I'm going to give five more of
