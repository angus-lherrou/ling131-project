I own this was imagine if you if you had a habits for like two hours you you'd walk out [laughter] I don't think you can take it\nLike we should have you on our show on Saturday you should come on this Saturday 'cause you just you can have it you can hear there whether I could do it I I\nActually do it that way ...\nYou could yeah you might be able to handle them a little nap long as you guys can hang [laughter]\nAll right so the prediction okay limits just congratulating real quickly here first before do anything let's congratulate Tommy ...\nAll right so the prediction okay let me just congratulating real quickly here first before do anything let's congratulate Tommy vote of Las Vegas when the winds that's right tickets to see John forward if the wind Tommy enjoy the show congratulations to you I'm\nSo quickly uh we we did reach three hundred thousand dollars a in um in September what what do you think caused somebody like that and\nWhat I think it's a reflects on you know what's going on like the last couple of months I mean there are always a couple of months behind you're listening homes and then you're getting offers and it's closing you know thirty to forty five days later so that's probably the reason why it's still going up now I'm going to predict that it's not going up any more\nI Would say we're still thirty or forty five days later that doesn't really quantify light went up but I don't have an answer or what do you play exactly it I don't have an answer because listening are going up their supply yeah we're at sixty three hundred right sales are going down so it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense\nBut it's still about a two month supply of homes and they say we need to six months areas to Muslim\nAnd I had a lot better than a month's sweet on which we had lots supply we'd never need\nSix months that's a stupid so that's what some people say it's or balance market was six months I mean is that I Know we hear that all the times three months four\nMonths perfect but\nThe fact that the beginning of the year we had what four weeks supply and now we have two months right and then we were of course we're going to go up right right and now we have more supply\nAnd sales are going down I I honestly Allen I have no answer for why we went up to three hundred thousand doesn't make any sense to me it really doesn't so you're the real estate guy you explain\nAnd yet I tried to like it is a new homes are\nAre are are selling well too well and that has nothing to do with new ... new homes were at three hundred and eighty thousand or or something ridiculous um but that kind of makes sense because just the costs of concrete and materials and and labor's going up I mean I kind of makes sense but\nResell I I I Would say I mean we're we're top demand three hundred ... I Would almost bet anything work ... next month we're not going to be above three hundred now not an image or he keeps rising\nAnd a salad or stay in the way they are ... and especially going into the fourth quarter into the holidays there's no way it's going to go higher than three hundred I mean we are at the top right now\nIf someone wants to sell their house they better shake it up and do it now\nWell I I see it on my end we we've slowed way down as far as getting contracts in um we were busy during the summer so so I guess I I can see why that happened but\nI just don't know I I just don't understand what we had that lack during the summer right because it confused as it went from two eighty five\nIt jumped at two Ninety five right and then it dropped a tune idea where they have a new way man what a couple of months in right that's come we thought was going to happen and then he got his way to do it by three hundred right yeah I mean honestly I don't I Wish we had a better answer for you but there really is no way to quantify why does happen\nTo you know and he said and I have you on the fourth quarter by the way not selling because people are thinking about holidays and all that jazz and we always come down in the winter months but I remember when we sold our home up and marine county when we moved\nHere and it actually closed a between Christmas and New Years we we were up and we'll sit down at the time we had to do all transactions way back in two thousand I think we have the troops are transaction via I'm a you know a bag of what it was weird thing with all the snow and it\nA Christmas I mean that's the nose is from our show from doing it for years I'm always my busiest time it's\nBack and forth was weird thing with all the snow and it was a Christmas\nI mean does the nose is from our show from doing it for years I'm always my busiest time is November December really yep for me and my team or a swamp and I and I think some of the reason is is that we answer a phone\nWhen everybody else is drinking eggnog and party and we answer a phone we're still taking lessons we might have less cells but the people that are looking are serious\nYou know you don't have look you lose looking between Thanksgiving and Christmas right people are looking for homes there they're wanting to buy something right so and when they want to call somebody they need you to answer the phone and help them so we're busy\nYou're drinking the eggnog while your answer the phone\nOh we're doing both yeah we're we're going to parties ... were selling homes so were there so we we keep busy but it but it but as a whole December\nNovember December the cells do drop\nYou really think that's true by the way that um eggnog no have you got a ... you know now I don't think that a lot of real is real tours are are kind of just kind of shutting it on for the uh December going you know ... percent\nYeah there you know they take three months off it's crazy we see it I mean 'cause I see\nThem three months while I'm On my dad's already but but I literally hearing and the end of the year it's\nIf it's cricket's really\nAnd and here's the problem if you say it slow and you know and you keep saying that enough that you're not going to be busy you're not going to have any business it slows down well guess what happens at work it slows down but me and my team\nWhat we never say that we're busy we're delivering gifts were having parties were selling homes were taken list scenes\nWere busy and we answer a phone because that number that we that we advertise you know seven to three ten move talk their Taylor three dead move we answered the phone people know hey we want we want some answers we want to know about real estate we want to know about mortgages call three ten move\nSo that people who are really answering the people who are really out there we call you up are folks who are really addressed that as opposed to the un like look you know there has to do you know say a time and\nTime again if you're if you're going to get a good deal as a buyer and the ... in this holiday months that's the time because it's motivated sellers writer and yeah I mean they really is you want people traveling around in your house during Thanksgiving and Christmas I don't know so\nYou want to sell your house and they're willing they're gonna willing deal yeah we still have a couple of thousand cells in December satellite minutes that three thousand or we have so much I Know it's weird that we went down in may June and July right or yeah but like\nYou know leave it to Vegas Vegas is always unpredictable I mean come on since two thousand two thousand [laughter] it's always\nBeen a perfect the way we're going we're probably hit like three Fifteen by December\n... and actually how someone who when it come out to get your predictions about six months from now where you see this at all so when it come on back and talk about local\nCondos in town homes the uh they went up also the percentage from last year\nAstounding I think it's astounding metal that definitely makes sense there's an easy answer for that but we'll talk are we talking about

since he was last seen in public right to show you more than two weeks and now they're coming out and saying yeah we get so maybe maybe maybe somebody from Saudi Arabia to kill and so they're looking into after there was a fight a load of crap I mean let's just be honest okay\nWhat is the difference quickly between Democrats and Republicans the difference between Democrats or Republicans\nOh it's pretty easy I mean I mean in some ways it's very easy to check this out Republicans under Donald Trump remember we had a tax cut remember that the majority of the country experienced a benefit from this tax that river that remember that the um ah the unemployment rate\nFor the country as a whole blacks and Latinos and women in particular are in a playwright got down to record lows record lows right\nSo a lot of that came as a result of the tax cuts and some of the other uh hope and new and and and a monetary policies that are coming out of his minister ration\nRight\nBusinesses or you know a re prioritizing what they're doing because they believe that this pro business president\nIs going to have a positive effect on the country and he has and he has\nMeanwhile back at the farm Kamala Harris there that come out as senator from California she and other prominent Democrats wants to repeal all of Trump's tax cuts\nWhy you get benefits just to the middle class the ... and most of the people right and what they want to do is you place them with cash payouts for the poor and working class\nNow this is called this is a very good word for this and this is called socialism\nBecause what they're trying to do is say instead of you know having people get\nTax cuts and then have incentives through those tax cuts should be able to uh expand businesses employ more people instead of that I have that why in the\nPrivate sector the private industry go out there and be the heroes in this Kamala Harris and others are saying the government could do it a whole lot better\nWe could all you have to do is give money to people\nThe poor and working class will give money to them\nAnd\nYou know socialism works great as Margaret Thatcher once said until you run out of the other guys money\nFamously said that\nWhat they do as the the these Democrats are trying to appeal just before the election was Seventeen Eighteen days where there was before the election they want to go ahead and appeal to people who are poor\nThe these Democrats are trying to appeal just before the election was Seventeen Eighteen days where there was before the election they want to go ahead and appeal to

start out with Andy Andy you're on K ex ante welcome to the show this afternoon\nAndy thank you thank you for having me Yes sir\nSo I've got a kid in grade school middle school high school ... high school if you're on sports they do randomly drug test year so that one's\nGood way they they they they do that now yeah you you have to sign a waiver that says we have the right to randomly drug test your trial\nI didn't know that you just made my afternoon I'm very very happy thank you\nAnd and that one that's an opt in you don't have to do that I get it but\nThe schools itself just be look there's no way some computers gonna arbitrarily pick a school and they're going to Harvard surely pick someone in that school and reduce violence that way so it's really just a backdoor to start violating the rights what\nHappens when they find a Tylenol three that I gave my son my daughter 'cause she's got heavy menstrual crabs and now she's got a controlled substance charge you\nGot ... to say I want to understand this the first of all ... they said something that I wanted to get clear what you said some of those opt in what what does opt in which one is often\nWell sports are up then you're you're not required that there was\nOr not but it but if you get into sports though you were to say you have to sign a waiver your mandated to sign a waiver that they could do a random drug tests or are you saying that rock okay I I just want to clarify that and again I support that a hundred percent now your issue with these random test for uh for for guns on campus what is the problem\nWell number one is ever going to work they're never gonna randomly pick the right school in the right kids so either you touched them all at a school or your cuts nobody that's number one number two what happens with the stuff they find that isn't\nWeapons related it's it's just a way to start crying if you really want to stop shooting and get all this right get rid of schools all we got to do it from home that's something that makes sense anyway\nWell I I understand a lot of people I Know I I I I Know what folks who do home school their kids and they're very very happy with that idea but um I I I think you're going to have I think most people are not going to opt in for that though so\nLet me just say that first of all I understand that if kids and then that could be a gun going back many years I understand the kids bring certain\n... medicines to school I'm not talking about drugs pot or something or talking about like Tylenol something like that for Mr cramps or whatever the case as I understand it and correct me if I'm wrong but they have to bring this to the nurse and then have the nurse dispensed that is is that correct\nUh yeah and that's another business either\nNo I Know but they're trying to prevent kids from a having illegal drugs one and two from if they do search them and find Tylenol they wouldn't be accused of being\nA ... a drug you and I don't think they should uh prevent them having Tylenol\nAnd and Advil and stuff like that anyway so I I Would agree with you on that when I I just said that ... and we used to somebody else that I I'm going to expand this you know what I Would I Would actually agree with you I Would make it mandatory for all kids a random searches of ... when you walk into a campus\nHave a metal detector there and walk through the metal detector and if it goes off have somebody at the same sex\nPat you down if they find a gun you out of there I mean I I I I Would do that\nI I got tired my in my opinion it's the school's job to protect my kids it's not my kid to protect the school so they they need to work on a practical solution that protects the kids not not victimized victimize or strong word but what Rand randomly drug test or\nThe teachers randomly checked the teachers back to make sure they have the item\nI Would I I I at least that I I I have no problem I Would agree with you I I Know as you\nKnow that you have a problem\nThey have the item I Would I I at least that I I I have no problem I met agree with you I I Know issue but it we now know that your problem\n... screw the union I I agree with you though I actually agree with you we should drugged randomly drug test the the teachers to have no problem with I Know they would object but okay you know what I Would have no issue with it I Believe some of them would get busted\nBut um but what way do you think this you said it's after the kids to protect the schools up to the schools to protect the kids what would you recommend if I were not going to go to all home schooling what would you recommend for the schools to do to protect the kids against uh being shot up and everything\nI look I don't know why anybody needs a book bag it's way more like my kids don't even bring home homework it's all done on a notebook so I don't know why kids are walking around these people the book bags anyways where we're not in the winter here where we have big bulky jackets\nWe should be processing kids at the dorm by processing I mean you know\nIt's sunny Philadelphia an accurate her path down they you know like there should be someone at the door welcoming kids won't get for things that are unusual they don't really do that\nUm you know the kids should be engaged in talking to other um kids or something is weird so they should be able to help that way\nBut randomly do you really think that a computer summers randomly going to pick a school they're going to go into randomly pick Fifteen kids and they're going to prevent violence that way or do you think they're going to come up with a really good kid who has a portion of a joint that um that you know it it's going to get in trouble for having a drug test them\nThey're going to you know I'm I'm I'm a I'm an agreement here I'm going to be with your idea\nOf of uh I Would I Would have\nMetal detectors at every single solitary school and I said this earlier in this in the school year by the way um I I I really was very um are unhappy with the fact that they started the school year\nBy not having already isolated all the older school so they have um fencing around the school that you could not get in you can only enter and exit from one exit and um if that's the case if you have to exist but make sure that every kid or goes through a metal detector at that one of those one or two exits\nAnd that's how I Will have with that\nYeah that's how I Would handle it and um and they did not spend the money on these higher fences that I said they should have because they said well we don't have it well but they're spending money no a bunch of other ridiculous stuff\nUh but they'll spend the money I guarantee of God Forbid it ever happens but it'll be a day late in the dollar short but I'm a degree you know what random or ... have every kid goes through a metal detector as they go on the campus every single one of them and then you have to worry about randomly searching anybody\nAnd if the damage and really I thought the schools are already looked like presidents but I got from what we've got to\nDo I agree on both counts it is a damn shame and schools in some ways it looked like prisons\nAnd if anybody has a better idea how to make schools safer please let me know and we'll pass it along not that they would listen or care by the way Andy I appreciate your call my friend thank you very much and he's got an investment he's got three kids three different levels elementary junior high and in high school\nI feel for them I really really do\nMandatory going through metal detectors every student I Would do it I Would I Would have the money spent for that I Would do it seven three three kids in the Seventy three five nine six eight\nWe get back to that and I'm speaking of of this whole idea of stone drivers got some stuff I Want to talk to you about that real real important I think we'll do that next than kicks anti\nSchools conducting random

they did something to get you down down down down down and I I hear your budget oh wait that's just those kids laughing at me\nSeparate a study by this organization saw a five percent increase in the rate of crashes per million vehicle registrations reported to police in Colorado Oregon and Washington versus neighbors that have not legalized marijuana\nBut they are saying we're seeing it consistently higher crash risk in those states that have legalized marijuana for recreational purposes\nRecreational marijuana now legal in also California Alaska Maine Massachusetts and Vermont and twenty two other states have legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes I supported the medicinal legalization not the recreational by the way\nAnd they're saying the other big problem with this is that motorists sometimes mix different drugs like alcohol and marijuana making it harder to isolate their effects\nThere was a crash and funny Seventeen in rural Texas they killed Seventeen people actually it was caused by pickup truck driver who was high on marijuana and an anti ... medication slammed head on into a church bus\nAnd the uh the pick up repeatedly veered onto the shoulder and across the double yellow line for Fifteen minutes before it crashed into this or a church bus Thirteen people killed\nSo they're saying that law enforcement needs additional tools and advanced training to detect impaired drivers before the crash regardless of the pairing drug they're using\nThis for the study also done in Washington state they found a sharp rise in the mixing of drugs like alcohol and marijuana since the state legalized recreational marijuana twenty four team\nWon in for traffic fatalities in twenty sixteen one for involved drivers who mixed drugs or alcohol or combined drugs and again the most common combination\nThat they found was marijuana and alcohol said this\nWhen this was coming up for legalization in the state watch what you ask for it you may wind up getting it and we've got it\nIn the state watch what you ask for you may wind up getting it and we've got it you legalize it I didn't I voted against it marijuana has been legalized recreational purposes and now look at the problem we've got we've got big problems going on\n\nThe frequency of collusion insurance claims in Nevada rose about six percent higher than in nearby states where marijuana is still illegal\n[noise]\nAll right I I'm mentioning this because you know again it's legal we're not going to get illegal again\n\nBut I'm just telling you that we made a huge mistake and they are really sock it to the people big time figure out who are using pot and driving cars\n\nThey're trying to do a a a determination how how does that pot impairs drivers by the way I was getting to that and just a minute\nBut um\nThey did a study out of Canada as well new study found that marijuana can impaired drivers for up to five hours after their last\nYet\nDrivers smoke cannabis were able to complete simple tasks late breaking in maintaining a steady speed on the um on the road\nWhen it came to more complex driving maneuvers not just breaking in you know the speed\nWith more complex dry maneuvers those high on we'd they're saying we're significantly more at risk for crash\n\nYeah I mean you know you get loaded and ... is kind of go on ... who are saying I\nUh the the the five hours make him as soon as a surprise we thought the effects would be a strong but they were very significant five hours you're still considered loaded so few hours after you smoke you're still not in full control of your faculties when it comes to driving\nAn automobile\nStudied confirmed the theory that marijuana can make a driver more cautious but if only for a short\nAmount of time they also say this performance was almost always significantly\nBetter without cannabis got\nHuge huge mistake we made now we've got to find a way to make sure that when people are identified as being stoned\nFrom marijuana and they're driving\nThey ought to be a sock it to them just as heavy as they do alcohol and I they ought to increase the penalties are alcohol\nToo All right so I'm a new report also found a about\nThe issue of determining how pot in pairs drivers and we will talk about all that and more in a moment's can't put the genie back in the bottle cannot book of ... but if I

problem\n\nReal quickly a retired Los Vegas metro lieutenant Randy something has been in so many many times said there's without a shadow of a doubt more impaired drivers on the road because of this law then there was before legalize marijuana\nThere's been so many many times so theirs was out of a shadow of adult more impaired drivers on the road because of this law then there was before legalize marijuana you believe is likely to raise insurance rates for every one of the value right Randy\nExist technology has caught up with legal pot use yet that's the German someone's impairment or more guesswork and science and he's right exactly right\nAnd he says people want to have the freedoms that's fine if you want to get high fine there's going to be a price to pay\nAnd I think is
