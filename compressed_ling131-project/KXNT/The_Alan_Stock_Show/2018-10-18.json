[noise]\nI ... I Believe it when I see it one thing that concerns me is er twenty four states that ... originally had correct this in\nDown to fourteen ... the other team decided to opt die adult ahead of John and he doesn't need to know that so so that's that's me that's ends up a red flag my personal opinion [noise] okay I feel comfortable with envy energy as my my energy provider been known to me right now it's better than the unknown [noise]\nThat you know that is a great point well the question I asked him and um maybe I didn't follow the correctly and I'll take responsibility for that um I I said that if you had to do it all over again would you have put in there a plan\nTo to implement this and he said no you don't want to put that in the constitution and you know what he he he's right about that he is right you don't want to put it in the constitution buts\nWhat I should've followed up with was would you like to at least\nYou got it all over again written a plan\nThat you would have presented to back up your desire to people who vote yourself where you know you're not foot in the constitution the give us an idea of exactly what it is going to look like on the other side of a of of yes on three passing and is that makes it does it does it my concern and my father died in that as it gets\nIts current you know constitutional amendment if you will and\nYet ... free passes it but the yes vote and then we find out that it's not any good going to take out you know a lot of work to get it\nIt's going to say on social environment say constitutional them and to to invalidate that amendment and we're going to know for\nA year or two or three if it's if it's working are we when Congress passed a constitutional amendment to outlaw alcohol you know how they got it back again\nThey had to pass another couch there's a limit\nSo I Am saying is that what you're saying I I agree with you if they pass it now if it passes and you don't like it it's going to take the whole process again to unravel the right and do it and\nSo I mean that's part of that is the biggest argument I've heard a lot of people they're going to end the show what a fuss of the constitution on them and I think that's one of the biggest arguments I I've heard\nAbout that that's a big one for me as well [noise]\nAlright an NBA energy it apparently they are going to service in line 'til service lines and be the\nThe the the what else the infrastructure ... old ally dust over their lives and their poll a he was just saying that if you\nAre if you want to opt out and get energy from somebody from New Mexico that they can bring the their lives up to a certain point right but when it comes to them and getting them from that point whatever that point is to your house\nHe was saying that they would have to use the envy energy lines and I don't know whether or not it's built in the envy energy would have to allow them to do that\nIt it is built in there it is built in a big joke because I Know it's again I went back to you is the capital Cox you know if you if you want to if you have ... communication but you want to switch to\nDirect TV or I mean anybody at all you you can't use Cox lines ... if you're another communication a cable company is directly besides that example but other cable company want to come in you have your own infrastructure in place your own lines in\nThe Cox is not going to go oh shit share lives with me get outta here we we we spent money putting these and\nSo maybe my example is not a good one if I'm you're stressing maybe that you could use a that they would be able to you\nMy example is not a good one if I'm you're shifting maybe that you could use a that they would be able to use the same lines from I'm\nTalking to Fred who's a genius and some of this stuff here is that near extraordinary actually are extraordinary [laughter] so you're saying that is what he said that if this group from Mexico would come they could take the energy up to a certain point and utilize the envy energy lives we get them to us yeah they would essentially have to weeks those lines from\nEnvy energy they pay something for the use of those lines to get it from wherever they can get their power they have the energy be forced to at least those lines out yes\nI didn't know that I mean I I didn't you know who who regulates that [noise]\nUh I don't remember he said what ... what group it was or some other for whatever group wouldn't be the UC though it wouldn't be the ... the I don't believe it's a it's the same way I'm right now Cox\nOr on the telephone company the actual central link or whoever they are the pavement bark or whatever right they ... we used the polls to carry their lines\nAnd the energy owns every poll yes but they leave space on the poll to get back Cox cable to your house [noise]\nOkay I see what you're saying All right okay I mean there are so I mean they got they got that answer I was like beer I read you this is why a he's a [noise]\nA a a engine extraordinary he needs to make sure he's saving enough money on everything\nElse going on all things considered [noise] have you been\nSchool they're brought up to believe you try to eliminate the middleman this adds another layer of\nIt has a middle man if you will so I I I Am not knowing anything the fact is that just goes against someone with a half years between and when I entered she's a you know if if you use that energy that they would use the polls in the lives of envy energy if you're using solar\nYou might not have to do because you can just put those on your roof or wherever you want to do\nThat aspect of little scary to me as well um the equivalency that I can bring up is you have discount carriers are\nUsed to be metro PCS now is not part of the mobile or you can get a cheaper rate through those several cellular carriers than you could from the company that is carrying the actual data and the calls that's just how they're going to have to work out to be those agreements that may still get you a cheaper rate it may not what's the reliability enemy\nThat's that that that's something that again this is where they're they didn't have a real plan in place and that's the scariest part of this to me\nAnd he said they didn't want to put a plan in place because they want to put that into the constitution but on the other hand my suggestion was and I get involved with that and that's my my dad then what if they're presented a plan to say okay to be in in the in the question itself but we're going to go ahead and give you an idea of what it would look like and the other side and they don't have that right\nAnd I agree with his ... his point there that you don't want that in the constitution 'cause who says that Twenty years down the road that still the best method for creating an I meant it written in the plant but we could have rapid some documents that said that document number as it wherever showing us what it might look like\nAgreed with that [noise] so you know I Am still a little confused um [noise] but uh\nI think a lot over the next day or so and let you know what I'm going to do if you can early vote on Saturday and I will early voters are like really want a lot of people don't like it but I'll probably but I I wait till near the end though\n'cause they always really some crap on these people who are very very and they do oh you're from\nYou know are you holding my literally or two days of lab I ride my opponent you know ... those are the more you know I mean that kind of this kind of a ... you know people do\nYou are two days on my ... my opponent you don't use ... to get you know I mean that kind of a kind of a ... you know people do stupid stuff you know I'm you know um [noise]\nSo I can tell you I'm leaning towards you know okay All right let's say that I I think that the uh the way or the polls look right now is that people are leaning towards though that's what I'm getting look if you have to propose that I've seen so I'm just telling it\nOr we go to break I'm Josh sex and Bob read our winning are going to go see Gianforte on friday night excellence we got two more chances tomorrow\nExcellent and we actually we also ... coming up on the running rebel a first look a football game okay coming up a little bit and we're going to be talking with Chuck move just few moments you campaign manager for\nGoing back to cheers the fact that you're having us out here for being here once again my good friend appreciate it All right let's uh let's say you're gonna have to look a friend of mine and that is Chuck mood that Chuck is a I have no Chuck for about a hundred and fifty years I found a Chuck is uh\nThe I've know Chuck for about a hundred and fifty years I send a check is a very involved the political world is a political consultant he was the campaign manager for Dennis ... who passed away in the last day or so and joining us right now in the case says he lived like Chuck how you doing\nI'm telling you know what I Am for that was the only been a hundred and forty seven year\n[laughter] I'm Sorry a hundred and forty seven years we've known each other it's like I was I was off like I didn't carry that one or something like that it was my mom was like new match with the public forum that he\nI I did as a matter of fact the actually the truth is I've known for a it's almost Twenty years when I first came here and we did a of a live broadcast over a across on on a un Elvie I remember that a quickly I Know you were the um [noise]\nAre you in the campaign manager Dennis off I had them in my studio a number of times I consider them to be an absolute gentleman I Know some people what issues because he was the proprietor of\nFive or Brussels but you know he always a treat me with the respect the dignity and everyone else I knew he was also running for the assembly you or his campaign manager or I Want to get your reaction to his his sudden death and uh what the Republicans may do on the thirty fifth now\nYeah um yeah when I got the call and learned about this yesterday morning it was an ad will shock because he had just\nLeft Dennis the night before he had this huge campaign rally\nBlacks birthday party celebrating at Seventy or Seventy second birthday input rump nugget or just the night before a\nYou know he held court for three hours up on stage he had Grover Norquist there from Americans for tax reform sure go apply over there is longtime friend Ron Jeremy was there and he played happy birthday on the armonica\nA sentence last dog he's a big dog lover lost his dog a few years ago and the local animal shelter brought him a rescue\nDog a as a birthday present you could just see Dennis really got hooked up over that he was just so happy and you know that are at the end of it when he left he left with his friend Ron Jeremy and you know Ryan said in an interview yesterday that\nThen it told them it was the you know the ... negative light a Monday Night and then Tuesday Morning he was no longer with us and so yeah uh yeah I think I'm feeling a bit of a state of shock over [noise]\nYeah I was in my studio when the Tony brought me the news and I I I just could not believe and I was completely uh amazed by it because it was so sudden and and he said we wasn't ill or anything like that at the party that I'd be for\nNo I mean he was just absolutely great spirits you know the only problem that we knew what he had knee problems for a long time um\nSo they they arrange to bring a a bar to go up and he was able to sit on her leaned on behind the podium during the entire event but other than that he was he was at the Mayo Clinic two weeks ago and he had cataract surgery\nYou had to you know the second I've done the first one of the sons earlier I think in August and so he had his eyes were completely facts and he went to a complete health check up and nothing was detected\nA there so you know it it it will will have to wait and see\nThe uh the coroner a will do an autopsy and we're just waiting to hear the results of the autopsy to find out exactly you know what it was that he died from\nA couple of quick questions you've been around the political world for uh all the time I've known you plus a and now that he is is beyond his name is on the ballot you won the Republican primary in June and he was running against the Democrats are primarily Republican area\nUm first of all I understand that they're going to keep him on the ballot is that correct\nAnd he was running against the Democrats are primarily Republican area um first of all I understand that they're going to keep him on the ballot is that correct\nThat is correct the ballots are already printed it late to take his name\nOff the ballot but they will have a notice posted at polling locations that are that Dennis has passed away um and people you know there'll be advised that fact before they cast their ballots [noise]\nIs is that I mean I when I heard that I was just wondering is that cricket I mean I mean I understand that he passed away and everything like that but you're telling people that have been walking into the polling place you're letting them know if you vote for this guy he's a guy reading what do you do I mean it just seems kinda weird the thing with post that [noise]\nYeah but it's not unusual and that's the way it was established in law I Know\nIn other cases there had been candidates who've been kicked off the ballot for other reasons for example I think it was a four years ago we had two candidates were removed from the ballot because a court affirming that they did not live in the\n... and so they had to quote those noted so that that's not unusual in the green circumstances like that yeah it's I mean it's it's a bit jarring to think of that you know you're going to walk into the voting\nBooth and be told that you know a candidate you may have been ready to vote or has passed away and you got to make that decision if they if they hadn't heard of it before they go to the old uh but yeah that that just the reality of a weight on the way the law\nWe're talking with Chuck moose a former ah was campaign manager Dennis off\nA who just passed away question for you on this because I've heard two different um of answers to this all seems I'll get your thoughts on it um if then Islam\nWins a on it and and the election in November ... um I I've heard that the commissioners from the three counties that the thirty fifth overlaps would get together and appoint someone has to be Republican obviously I've also heard that the governor would have to appoint\nThe person and then we're not sure it would be the governor who was sitting in November or the upcoming governor who would be taking office January first so what is the definitive answer on that\nYeah there there was a lot of confusion on that yesterday late yesterday afternoon I got three different versions from different authoritative sources up it it appears the day that uh loses lawyers have looked into it and yes it will be because the thirty six district covers three different counties\nAre the three different county commissions will have to come together and agree upon who the successor will be um\nThat will be done with a great deal of uh influence from Republican Party\nOr in the Republican Party you know they're probably going to get together and try to decide they want to Catholic school pointing they'll make recommendations to the mic in and then I Believe the last thing I heard today Alan was that\nThe chairman of the three Catholics and they can get together and they decide ah you know the majority will decide so that you out of the three votes out of the free mission chairman a that to go with\nAnd by the way it was a thirty six thirty fifth of the let me speak correct yeah thirty six alright er and above the appointee a would have to be a Republican would that be correct\nThat is correct it would have to be of the same party as the person who is a of being replaced\nQuickly also I Want to know I understand that's Dennis off didn't have a couple of children have you talk to them or anybody else in his family\nUh I did talk to one daughter or the unfortunate sad fact is that then is in his two daughters have been strange for many many years uh they they haven't communicated at all um but you know in this case they they've asked to be you know please keep those are anonymous with respect our privacy we don't want\nIn a cage it at all um but you know in this case they they've asked to be you know please keep us uh anonymous respect our privacy we don't want to talk to anybody about this and then you know so I'm going to honor their wishes that oh\nOkay All right and a last question what about the uh the uh taking over of the the Brussels I understand are closed as of right now because he was license to for virtually himself so now they have to go through a process of\nTrying to get someone else to looking at it and ... who was a madam at one of them may be the one that they could fix fix them over is that correct\nYes Suzanne is absolutely wonderful woman I've gotten to know her or she has been with and then since day one um she's been with him for twenty seven year she's the general manager and it's been running the operations she's perfectly capable of continuing that now the or Brussels in Lyon county\nHer name is on the proper licenses so they're going to be able to continue operating without any any change yeah or or any delay in ... county only Dennis his name was on the proper license or the lawyers are looking at this now to see how to proceed\nOr they may have to go through the entire life and the process to reopen the NIH county bravo or if they want to keep that and and have shoes that clear to be ah the operator for that one\nHe would have been a a good spokesperson somebody by the way for keeping a legal prostitution is legal in the state of Nevada and now there's going to be a big battle over that as well so we'll see how that plays out Chuck moved a was a there was a campaign manager Dennis off our condolences to you and all the folks who are close to Dennis ... of a joke\nOr appreciate it out and I think next month or a hundred and forty eighth anniversary so we'll have to get

local tax laws or the fifth most on equal in the country with the state's forest populations paying the highest percentage of their income in taxes that's according to a new study more in the story from reporter Catherine Davis young\nThe analysis by the nonpartisan Institute on taxation and economic policy shows that on average the poorest twenty percent of Americans spend about fifty percent more of their income on taxes than wealthy people do\nIn Nevada the difference is even greater Carl Davis one of the study's authors says Nevada's porous tax payers spends more than ten percent of

John ... John how are you doing\nYou're right good to talk to you again\nThank you so much for joining us to subdue I Do appreciate it um let me ask you um\nI I Want to get into this idea of where we went on the senators and everything\nBut first of all the latest news coming out is that not only as the president threatened to send the military to the southern border to seal it uh because of this caravan that has now thousands of people there was a hundred a few hundreds before nuts thousands of joining a to a break you down the a A R border\nBut now it turns out they actually have footage I've seen it by the way of the of women and children being given money to join the caravan and storm the U.S border your thoughts on this John\nWell I mean I guess I'm not really surprised a Pearl either giving them money and they're flying them with food and doing other logistics or to go and help them come there uh seen estimates\nThat it may cost something like Twenty one million dollars just to supply the logistics yeah for the four thousand or whatever people that they have to come up so\nYou know whether it's Soros or whoever's doing it I guess our fruits or a sister you know I guess they believe that it's going to create a political embarrassment for Trump right before the election uh mid term elections\nYou know I guess I Would have thought it might have had the opposite effect uh but you know I guess since they're trying to emphasize as you say\nThey're trying to emphasize as you say giving money\nTo women and children who ... to come but they think that that will make it most difficult for the president at that time\nSee and I agree with you one of your thoughts on that and that is I think this is going to secure the base uh I'm I'm saying I Want the president to take the bull by the horns I Want the president to seal that southern border\nAnd uh I'm a and it makes me even more and more want to vote for people uh and senators and congressional represents we're going to support the president on this\nBut I mean I guess the problem is exactly how do you feel the border without a wall and\nThe sense that the um when somebody gets one foot on us soil they're basically here\nThat don't allow that don't ... I mean that's why he wants to put the military on the border\nTo seal the southern border and I'm saying to do whatever it takes to where we are allowed to send our own our own home you're allowed to defend your family tries to break into your home they can't say I get through the doorway and now I'm I'm entitled to stay in John lots home I mean even before they come in you're going to make sure they don't even get it at the door and me to write\nWhat we did a study earlier this year uh I had done some a consulting work for the county prosecutor is in Arizona\nAnd uh I was able to get a hold of data on the prisoners over thirty five year period in ah Arizona\nTo see whether or not they were legal or illegal aliens are and what you and then compare those to their share of the overall population in Arizona and what you found was that\nAliens were about two hundred and Seventy percent a greater share of the prison population and they were of their share of the general population\nAnd not only that they tended to be involved in much more serious crimes they were even much more over represented in terms of murders breaks\nA sexual abuse of shoulder and other types of really heinous crimes than the general US population you found that legal aliens uh people who'd come into the United states legally\nTended to be relatively law by a but the ones who came in illegally were much more likely to be\nReally dangerous violent criminals or forty five percent more likely to be members of gangs\nOr they were about a hundred percent more likely when they were sentenced to be set and says particularly violent individuals' um you know so um you know I think\nAnd there are lots of other things I could talk about there but it's\nThe problem is most of the studies that had been done are basically all the other studies that have been done a either mixed together legal and illegal aliens or they're based entirely on surveys where you're having to ask people are you here illegally or not\nAnd then ask them do you have a criminal history and there are strong reasons to believe that people who are illegal aliens who have\nBeen in prison because they're kinda like double the illegal or might be reticent to go in and tell somebody who's surveying them that that's the case and therefore it would make it look like even the illegal aliens you had\nWere relatively Rabbani because you're just relying on their word for whether they're law buddy\nWell actually the case as a matter of fact if they're going to be breaking the law to get into the country I mean you know what the hell of an ...\nOn their word for whether they're law\nWell actually the case as a matter of fact if they're going to be breaking the law to get into the country I mean you know what the health another above breaking the law here and there\nIs not that big of a deal as opposed to the came in legally and a cherished is the fact that they are here now and want to be able to you know a walk through the straight and narrow so to speak as opposed to getting in any trouble and being tossed out there they waited a long time to get in quickly and we've got a lot of time but I Want you told me the importance of being able to look at\nThe Senate races this particular year\nRight but I mean uh one of the more important aspects is or the court a nomination certain becoming a Schiphol focus a lot on the Supreme Court\nBut ah ... the ... almost all the cases are decided at the district and the Supreme Court level so for example last year\nOr the Supreme Court or heard about a hundred and thirty cases\nAh the circuit courts in the country heard and decided fifty two families in cases she you're talking about just a tiny tiny Chris part part of one percent go to the Supreme Court for a decision and so the circuit courts are kind of the final\nSupreme Court in a sense for the vast majority of cases in it and the problem is is that while conservatives might have a five to four majority on the on the Supreme Court ah\nDemocrats\nDominate a the lower courts are\nFor the Thirteen or circuits federal circuit or the Democrats are firmly in control eight of the circuits the Republicans have a majority on for and you have one that's tied\nA you know even if a Trump could fill all the current vacancies that are there\nAre the Democrats would still have a seven to four majority with two ... being tie\nAnd it's unlikely given the huge dominance of the Democrats have that you know at the end of a second term for Trump or that he could just put the ... circuit courts in balance at that point\nOr if the Democrats win control the Senate or they've already promised that they're going to bring the nominations do hope that Trump's aren't going to get any more uh people can for\nAll the more reason to make sure that they absolutely do not get in and take control of the Senate or the house for that matter John lots a contributor to the Fox news channel an author of course joining us right here I ...

rest of them so people really knew\nThey did it so what do they do well they get a Lee Harvey Oswald\nWhich is what they did which is what I predicted they would do so one of the Fifteen Saudis who arrived in Turkey the same day that the show he disappeared guess what you're ready he has died and they suspicious traffic accidents\nYeah wow\nSo and they're saying by the way the Saudi council and this ... book could be the next execution I don't know what's what's going on but anyway [noise] [noise]\nOh yeah very dramatic stuff unless ... side on our butts tiny whatever the hell is name as a

while he went in and he just never disguise all him but he said it's over we'll have to worry about any more\nThinking about it\nI mean do I believe that they did of course I mean I I mean everything points for that okay but the the issues though is\nPeople drinking by this kind of crap I mean other really gonna buy it and uh ... the answer's yes I mean I think that people will just give up on it they did with Lee Harvey Oswald didn't they\nMean Harvey Oswald allegedly shoot the president on a friday and then Sunday Morning you have um you know this guy can be an end just shoot him in the police are in the police station the garage oh right okay yeah right\nAnyway and and\nPeople let things go after all these years and they'll let this go to this I mean you know not that I think that

conveniently dead and they don't know how he he died in this car accident was mysterious\nOkay well then you get the general idea um\nLet me share this with you also we're in a lot of time in in the segment I but I Do want to share this with you and I'm going to war in a few moments\nYou know I talked to the other day about the two GOP candidates were solved it in Minnesota\nThe Minnesota Democrat Party suspended or one spokesman for calling for violence against Republicans but meanwhile uh the and one of he said something like a the election will bring republic\nFor violence against Republicans but meanwhile uh the and one that he said something like a the election will bring Republicans to the guillotine on November seventh okay there you go\nAnyway that's just ... days after the Minnesota state represents ... Anderson was punched in the arm after spotting them and destroying Republican yard signs and you know there are so she's got to now be accompanied by somebody with her which is campaigning\nAnd she was the only GOP candid attacked you have a state representative candidate Shane medical and suffered a concussion after getting sucker punched while speaking with constituents at a restaurant in Vinton County\nNumber Maxine Waters said what do you see them at a restaurant is she a at a gas station doesn't matter what it is gather a crowd around told me not want anytime anywhere\nAnd this guy was in a uh was in a restaurant and this guy came over and sucker punched me fell down hit his head cold cocked him a big time and he hit his head on a tabletop and um\nThe police have not a charge this guy yet the alleged assailant because they want to see just how bad the um\nThis this guy's head really is [noise] yeah I mean something like that but I mean how would how bad are the the injuries will charge them based on the seriousness of the injuries so they're waiting to charge him that's\nJust that's ... that's great I bring this up for a reason though because uh here in um\nThe great state of Nevada in Las Vegas I might add\nThe kind of in a mark Mike shark might start was arrested into Tuesday evening after I'm\nAllegedly right allegedly he a grand and yank the arm of Adam lax office manager Kristin Davis and\nUh this might start by the way a real dark colored guy notorious for aggressive behavior would do and members and their aides the Republican Party and it's been all over the place because I mean are you grab this woman\nBecause you know he's a massage us right now this woman any excuse to let her go\nYou know and uh you know finally she had to say you know a Adam do something I don't know why Adams in something the first place by the way I'm just asking a you know should have kicked guys ask but I don't know what he did but eventually uh this guy was stopped\nSo it's it's big news that you have the campaign manager of the Republican candidate for governor who stayed in Nevada attacked\nBy there's a there's psycho\nAnd guess what now you're not you know you you you believe this renting you ready the New York times MSNBC CBS Evening news NBC nightly news ABC's world news tonight all of them all of them you guessed it totally ignored the
