New York and R. J. T. T. F. I Believe that's a joint\nTerrorism task force has engaged with our federal state and local partners to investigate as this is an ongoing investigation we will have no further comment at this time and\nBy the way for the ... you know in the degree of the record uh I'm guessing that J. T. T.\nF. is joining terror or joint tactical task force one of the two very clearly when you are mailing an explosive or sending an explosive that his chair\nAnd the fact that you were talking about Secret Service protect these that is pretty much a given we will be bringing you this breaking story\nAs it develops all throughout the morning here on Nevada's morning news here in Nevada police are investigating to robberies and your desert pines high school officials say three students were robbed at gunpoint within Fifteen minutes yesterday morning\nThe suspects are described as a thin black

phone video students having sex inside a high school bathroom three sunrise mountain high school students were cited after video to students having sex in a bathroom were posted on line\nA needless to say though coming on the on what happened to George Soros says house and as you say perhaps or what may be happening and CNN in New York uh this is a very troubling turn of events are here the in this country I suppose\nWe're talking with Westwood One White House correspondent I'm a Bob constant teeny uh this morning I Would be remiss if I did not say this and it's important to say this in this political climate\nAll of these individuals and this network are all targets a presidential attack\nAnd we are talking about the Clintons we're talking about Obama we're talking about ... we're talking about CNN and this is one of the worries that we have with our political discourse getting so violent\nIs that while some will say it's hyperbole it's just ... up the base the problem is there a lot of scrutiny people out there who take this stuff literally and they think they're carrying the water for somebody else may be a political figure that they care about and that obviously when we're seeing this is very worrisome\nAnd Michael of course it's easy to uh make the assumption it's not a great leap to make the assumption that of these packages had been sent by the same person or persons right a in a particular attempt or whatever to either intimidate or to hurt people I'm\nA leading the head of the mid term elections or are people who are are helping Democrats in particular of course President Obama has been on the campaign trail a little bit George Soros says we know a strong supporter of progressive and liberal causes um that it will get pause to anybody\nOr other any

this morning they were identified immediately according to the secret service during routine screening\nThe New York times reporting the device addressed a former secretary of State Hillary Clinton was similar to one found near the New York home of billionaire George Soros yesterday CBS News security consultant Ron ... says investigators may now tried to trace online searches for SARS is many

information for you\nOr that CNN Center has been evacuated uh that uh they have\nA suspicious device there we also understand that packages have been delivering a package has been delivered to the White House or was going to be delivered to the White House it went through the mail screening\nA facility at the White House and was intercepted let's get to a gym shooter right now who is outside of the CNN bureau talking to Washington\nIt delivered to the former president home of Hillary Clinton Barack Obama director and the White House ... minutes later we were told that they should uh

center in New York at Columbus Circle which is the headquarters\nOf the CNN bureau in New York has been evacuated because of her report of a suspicious package this is coming after a suspicious package\nWas discovered that was going to be delivered to President Obama this morning by the secret service we also understand that a package was delivered to what we think is the White House male clearance center a at a local military base\n'em within a day or so or received within a day or so of each other\nSo naturally law enforcement's going to say that\nUm ... the coincidence would be absurd the thing is very important to to take a look at that makes this very interesting to me anyway is at first you would think these were just the targets the liberal targets you've got George Soros you've got both Clintons you've got the Obamas\nAnd CNN which has been under attack by the president and the conservatives\nBut when you enter into the picture that a package was also sent to the White House or in my mind that completely changes the scenario one would assume because not only are you looking at targets of so called\nA under so called attack by uh the right in by the president but you also have a conservative president uh who would be under attack when you realize this package is being sent to the White House\nDon't forget that is an office but it's also a home\nIt is also home of the president and the first lady and their son Baron\nOh so this is very very clearly one would have to assume I think it's reasonable to assume that there is some sort of\nA
