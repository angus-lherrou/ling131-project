and more towards the singles this is the money that home improvement show I'm Tom quite lurk in Jamestown Rhode Island today\nAnd I'm here hanging with our friends from this old house they've invited me\nTo be a part of the final day of production here and James now as a complete and a really unusual house they've taken a one hundred year old seaside house that when it was originally built was probably never intended for anything other than summer residency they bolted on a brand new addition and they've made this entire structure so energy efficient\nIt's now known as a net zero house which means it's designed to create the total amount of energy it needs to operate so coming up this hour we're going to get all the details on that project straight from the chia which team\nIncluding Kevin O'Connor Roger Cook plus norm ... will be by to talk about a very special mouse to reach by very few programs because this is the forties season of this old house so let's get through it to get things off I'm very pleased to welcome a great friend of the money pit Kevin OConnor welcome Kevin\nAnd I mean that the recovery and literally because not only are you are now but you've been\nKevin OConnor welcome Kevin and I mean that figuratively and literally because not only are you are now but you've been a friend too many homeowners now for many many years in your role as host and congratulations on the forty a season of this old house while\nYeah season forty of the the forty years if something were very proud of his you know I Can't take any credit for that I've only been doing it for the last Fifteen or the other boys are at twenty five years ahead of me on that but it's a testament to what norm Roger Richard in time he started back in Nineteen Seventy nine um that it's still\nGoing that it's still popular that we're still doing beautiful building like this and we're taking it for a little bit of a victory lap are proud of it\nAbsolutely ... tells me about this area of Jamestown network out right across the river from Newport which is famous for mansions and cliff walks is this where you move if your name wasn't Vanderbilt\n[laughter] I'm not sure it's an island or I Am right in their games it sounds so to the west of us at the mainland of Rhode Island and then to the east of us as you say is the peninsula of Newport where all the mansions are all the sailing\nOr it's a smaller island community back in the day people had to take the ferry to go to school for a year to the mainland that we're now connected by bridges but it's always been sort of you know one step removed from the hubbub of Newport for us it's the home of architects is also a homeowner right who's fall in love with\nKind of a draft these small inefficient summer home to watch probably one of the most efficient homes in the areas and it's been expanded a lot so you need to figure out how to make space for all that in the landscape so tell me about that process because I think a lot of our listeners maybe\nHave never worked with a landscape architect mhm [noise]\nWell we uh we took a look at the lot and on a lot this guy is usually you try to use every square inch is a lot is usable space for the people that are here\nAnd uh so we\nWe took a look at the layout of the new house and try to relate spaces outside or inside so there is a a kitchen and backdoor entrance where they come and go most of the time in a trash comes in and out we place to grill near the back door a\nThere is the barn or that they're in and out of the new projects it's a it's a family of of\nOf ah constructors right ... definitely builds yeah\nSo we created a working yard off that garage in off the kitchen with a a with an old flat open space a little area of of paving a little vegetable garden and there's a sliding door between the garage in this open space so it's kind of the overflow workspace\nSo and so it's kind of like I'm bringing the indoors out in the outdoors in addition to carry space where she's very comfortable moving from one zones and the next ... exactly that's where the design comes in in his eyes from the design\nNow you've got to actually play in the physical elements actually perform what that intent is yes oh yes so\nWe gave them both are in an area of heart surfers in an area of grass a it designed defense of this kind of the back wall of this space put up a hedge between the house\nAnd the working yard which takes out some of the view of the mess that might be there in the back yard right out of the out of the kitchen windows ... uh and then that's also the circulation space into the back into the back back yard a which is a larger grassy area for their two young boys to get out and do what young boys do\nNo if folks are listening to this thinking you know what process\nYou go through if I Want to improve my backyard space what kind of chips would you give them to kind of get the starring will either which you mentioned before about relating the inside of the outside is vitally important okay so you can have a great space outside but if you can't get to it\nIt doesn't do a lot of good right [laughter]\nAnd and you want to go inside and look out all the windows you know because you're going to live in a in this New England we live inside quite a lot of the time I owe a lot of views out the windows are just as important as the views of the house or the news in the open space\nAnd then to zone those different areas as they relate to the house and then as they relate\nTo the outside property lines we don't really think of the outside as being rooms but sensitive to exactly the ruins and in the smaller the house the more useful those rooms are more important they are right\nIf you got five acre lot you have a house in near its usually in line and you know everything kinda bleeds out when you have a small house like this those outside edges become more to find and they become more integrated into the living in the house\nAnd bleeds out when you have a small house like this those outside edges become more defined and they become more inner grew into the living in the house so all really important things to keep in mind if you're\nYou know if you just completed the summer and you're thinking about now\nSo I'm gonna start planning for next year you got about six or eight months now to start staring at those windows and thinking about those bases that and\nYou know really living through it and your head mhm maybe make in the paper model of I always just because people sometimes can't imagine the space shuttle sets sack but now's the time to do that and that's great information so congratulations on Wheldon project\nHere Tom Ryan landscape architect on this project thank you so much for stopping by the money that great thank you\nAnd you'll find this old house and asked us on the house on your local PBS stations plus for more details in behind the scenes photos visit this little house dot com or follow at this little house on Twitter and\nFacebook and ... wage Jamestown well as you heard\nThere are many many things about this home that are special and that includes the lawn there's actually a very unique type of turf called micro clover here\nWith us to talk about that is this old house landscaping contractor Roger Cook and pat Hogan was side co welcome guys welcome how are you so this is a house where the environment is really at the forefront and you've chosen a type of Turks here\nThat is extremely sustainable and pretty much defines a environmental sensibility for for a landscape let's talk about you call it micro clover what is\nThe micro clover is just what it is it's a ... it's a it's not like the Dutch clover right minimally flowering non colonizing clover okay that we've mixed in with a tall task you mix in his very trout tolerant\nThe clover takes the atmosphere nitrogen converted into nitrogen that the grass can use so you don't need to fertilize it\nHer Roger when it comes to fertilizing and getting the the one chemicals just write that something trips a lot of people up right\nWhere we spend a lot of time on our lawns trying to get 'em just right and usually it's in the past it's always been a bluegrass lawn right bluegrass lawn so a lot of water and a lot to feed and then you got to spray the weeds and bugs and everything else\nThis type of terrific you see a lot commercially is it unusual to put it in a residents well we just started growing this in the past few years in right so it's something that's going on we see is the future is going to keep going ...\nHow does it stand up in terms of like wear and tear I mean this house has has two kids are growing up in it you know the top of that\nIt's tough for that at the idea house a couple of weeks ago here for this old house so they had quite a bit of traffic and cross that lawn and uh I was back there last week with the professor from Penn State that it doesn't research on this stuff look gorgeous he was a very happy to see\nSo when you put down a side Roger as opposed to you know growing one from scratch once the prep involved\nOr that I think it's the same as we've always been doing right we take what soil is here and we rotor Tiller scare by and losing it all All right so that the roots that are coming in can get down into a tank of themselves that get whatever moisture is there than we find grade we'll ... we'll put in some lime if it needs it and then the seat is on [noise]\nNow we're in the midst of a wrench all rainstorm right now [laughter] I had to eat off as a health issue with irrigation today but does it take the same amount of water or less or more than you wear traditional long we'd get\nAnother one of the beautiful things about it it does not use a lot a lot of water and they'll yeah we have to get in fact we have to educate people who are not watering so much\nAnother one of the beautiful things about it it does not use a lot a lot of water and ... yeah we have to get in fact we have to educate people who are not watering so much\nThat's right yeah at the idea house I've already had to contact the irrigation contractor and say shut the water off the I had enough [noise]\nSo how can you add this to an existing ward you always have to start from scratch with San ... I think\nWith the micro clover you can over seated into it but I Would say you wouldn't want to do it into a bluegrass lawn because that's not really a drought tolerant or more than a century right correct and that's just not because they're not going to get along right those two types right yeah we've put it in with the tall fast you that's more drought tolerant\nThough this is a harsh environment because it's right here on the coast I guess they're appropriate product for a seaside community\nAre yes it is a lot of salt in it all that actually more of salt resist in bluegrass is well that's what I Love about this old\nHouse in ... you know you learn things that you just wouldn't imagine really exist I mean the fact that there's this very specialized type of side that has all these benefits to it\nIs is so cool I'm In a while you guys\nThey'll always sort of pushing the envelope and coming up with this stuff for projects like that it's just you know it just keeps fashioning your age and that's probably why they're around for for forty years now is the end of the forty a season so congratulations on all the good work you put into that Roger him bank some around

certainly the case with this old house as well lots of wiring that had outlived its usefulness including what would have been probably the original wiring for one in your home type called not into\nIt with us to talk about the safety of all that old wiring and what needs to be done with it as electrician been Giles welcome Ben how're you we're good thanks for stopping by the money that this is a interesting area lots of lots of history right here\nLots of old homes and would you agree that number two is probably the first ... wearing the than as these buildings\nYeah for sure that was the first modern type of wiring that could be afforded by your average person it wasn't as steel type installation or something that was highly labor intensive to install so it was pretty widely used in the early Nineteen hundreds as one of the first real residential methods of wiring\nNow it's interesting for those that are unfamiliar with not been too We're actually talking about real knobs and real to cheer when it was run through beans so you drill hole and it was like a ceramic tube through it\nTo sort of inflate the wire from the wood and then when it went perils of the themes that would be strung on these ceramic knobs and it was essentially an air cooled system so air had to circulate around it\nBut then we decided we were going to have these homes an installation and what happens\nWell it heats up the other thing I think that happens to a lot in these older homes as you know in the homes are originally built designed they weren't designed for things like vacuum cleaners dishwashers air conditioners all of these modern appliances that we have today\nAnd all of those things these days are grounded a lot of the time so\nWhat you get is people kind of tagging new wiring on to the old system in unsafe way race\nAnd using it incorrectly a and again those systems were never intended to carry those kind of loads coupled with horror installation techniques of newer wiring and they and the increased loads of the homes it just creates in dangerous situations but the original installation the way that it was intended to be used was actually not that one is fairly safe\nIt was it was the environment changed around it now for this house here in Jamestown did you find any existing nominate two that were still active\nOh yeah there was definitely most of the house had some now than to than it there were a lot of things topped off of that now than to just like I said people trying to get something that they didn't have and make it work with the existing system [noise]\nUm so it was definitely a relatively dangerous situation in this house you know the things that definitely needed to be taken back to zero and start over\nTheir real education and I understand that you spent quite a bit of time working with The Apprentice is for the season Mary Smith and and\nZero and start over\nTheir real education and I understand that you spent quite a bit of time working with The Apprentice is for the season Mary Smith and Kevin Barker how'd they do\nAll those guys are great I've actually known Kevin for quite a while he worked for another

news that has been sort of like a really kind of hitting my the the most recent one that I think a lot of people are seeing it's much more for the film than any horror aficionados like myself\nAnd that is a little bit of a bear trap that Jason Blum has stepped into this week Jason Blum is most famous for running bloom house which is one of the most profitable studios\nIn America at this time I mean grant he's not making these three hundred million dollar movies like the Avengers he's making a lot of smaller independent horror films he's basically using the model that was done in the eighties with the slasher movies and that's appropriate because\nThat's what Halloween was actual friday the thirteenth was in fact really more than anything else spreading their team put this formula together whether they spent less than a million dollars or maybe a billion maybe a million and a half dollars to make these\nSmall budget horror movies that would then be twenty thirty million dollars or more in the theaters and that's all you needed to drop profit\nAnd so he put that model together recently he started with paranormal activity was one that really kinda rocketing bloom house to fame or better and I'm like too many movies are\nAre cheap movies to make their video cameras and they're limited sets limited cast and that's the formula you don't spend a whole lot of money making the movie and then the movie doesn't have to make two hundred million dollars to be a hit it just has to make twenty thirty million and they're really doing movies like truth or dare\nAnd that's one that came out earlier this year that was kind of garbage but he does a lot of PG Thirteen sort of disposable ... horror movies out there that that like I said is very comparable to the eighties slasher movies and the horror movies that came out back then\nSo he's a very profitable producer\nHe was in an interview this week and he essentially said I'm going to paraphrase him I'm not going to be the exact quote but you can find it if you really want to hear centrally said that they don't hire female horror movie directors because there aren't very many out there he basically says are very few female directors out there and even fewer that want to work in horror\nMy job as a service officer is to ensure these veterans have what they need to drive and move for their lives we're they're

value Sunday Morning at five on news talk eight forty AM K accent the [noise]\nAnd we'll come back to that guy at the movies with Kevin car here we are\nTwo weeks before Halloween Halloween falls in the middle of the week so it's really only a week and a half until Halloween [noise] so we only have one more weekend after this to really fully enjoy the Halloween spirit and go do the crazy stuff on friday and Saturday Night and then we have Halloween which was on a Wednesday\nNights kind of like it when Halloween falls in the middle of the week because that's one trick or treaters and it makes it a little more easy when Halloween falls on a friday it gets really messy\nThat is one trick or treaters and it makes it a little more easy when Halloween falls on a friday gets really messy yeah I I have a son who's still trick or treat these ten\nBut I I like what it falls in the middle of the week because then you can enjoy suffering in the middle of the way we can get so busy and crazy and uh you know Halloween on a Saturday as a as kind of a nightmare\nBut since we're going back to the Halloween movies and we're looking back at them because we have a new Halloween film it's the third movie title Halloween you had the original Halloween and Nineteen Seventy eight\nWith John Carpenter directing then you had the awful just truly terrible Rob Zombie remake in two thousand seven I think\nAnd now this was also caught Halloween it's the sequel to Halloween it gets a little confusing [laughter] it's sort of like how when they made a prequel to John carpenter's the thing in two thousand eleven and they just called it the thing so they have the thing which is a prequel to\nThe the thing it's it's it's a dumb way of naming things in Hollywood but you know who knows\nAnyone's that kind of wanted to look back at the Halloween franchise 'cause a couple of years ago I went over to a friend's house and we've been to watch all the friday the thirteenth movies all in one day than we did that a couple months later with Halloween and we did that with nightmare on elm street and I will say that while Halloween the original Halloween is my favorite\nCredits thirteenth is the most consistent through the series Halloween ... has a great strong start but it it it deteriorates faster and I kinda wanna look back at those Halloween movies\nBut of course you have the original so I I gotta kinda hard that out on its own no pun intended because it's the one that started at all [noise]\nAlthough in a small American [noise] years ago [noise]\nI spent eight years trying to reach that another seven tries to Cape ... because I realized what was living the heightened that boy's eyes was purely and simply [noise] on a wave fight this\nWas the original it's still a scary movie I mean it seems rather tame by today's standards I never saw it in Nineteen Seventy eight 'cause I was like seven when it came out and that was way too young to go see it\nI should not have seen that movie when I was seven I ended up watching it oh gosh I think I watched it on paid them back at a friend's house when I was probably I don't know eleven or twelve I was pretty young to see it and it was a big deal because it was an R. Rated movie and a half boobs in it\nBut I remember we were watching it on this tiny little TV I mean it was you know nowadays kids don't understand nowadays every even this multi these are big and they watch them on their phones but he'll put the phone five inches from your face\nBut I remember sitting there and my friend's house watching it on this probably twenty inch TV\nAnd his dad came in the room and it's not getting grabbed her legs ... because we were both facing the TV screen I mean there's a lot of fun and it was the original slasher the original Halloween is as close as you can get to sort of that perfect movie it has the trappings of its era I mean it's a seventies movie\nYou've got the fashions you've got the limitations from the seventies movie but the thing is for a slasher movie which is essentially what this is the start of the slasher crazy you don't need\nA whole lot of big special effects so you don't need a big ... for something like this you can do in effect the movie with some camera tricks and it was John Carpenter at the top of his game and yeah he had done some interesting stuff beforehand like assault on precinct Thirteen\nBut this really galvanized him as a hard director and his output from Halloween on is amazing because you have Halloween\nThirteen but this really galvanized him as a hard director and his output from Halloween on\nIs amazing because you have Halloween and then of course you had the thing in Nineteen eighty two and you had the fog in Nineteen eighty which was a real interesting movie\nAnd you had like prince of darkness later on and they live in big trouble in little China all that out put through the eighties was launched with Halloween and I think it really pushed all the way until you got to in the mouth of madness in the nineties which I talked about a couple of weeks ago when it came out on blue right\nBut you can never be the original so that's one of my favorites but then there are sections\nAnd I don't like to break it down for a movie I like to break down in section ... the first sequels which was Halloween too on Halloween three seasonal which and I talked to great length about how much I Love Halloween three\nHalloween choose fine it's a it's an okay sequel it's worthy for its its successor but it's it's kind of re doing things that just puts them in a hospital instead of out in a trick or treat night but\nThose are the first thing they were trying to figure out what to do with the franchise 'cause these horror franchises hasn't really been done before so they had the direct sequel than they did the anthology style one\nAnd and that kind of killed the franchise for about five years and you got to realize that back then that was an attorney for a horror movie I mean friday the thirteenth was doing one right after another every year there was a friday the thirteenth movie coming out because they're cheap easy to make and you can do them quickly on a low budget\nBut it wasn't until Nineteen eighty eight that they ... boot of the series with Halloween for that started this three episode run of Halloween four or five and six and\nIt was every ten years this movie gets ... and then they got re booted in Nineteen eighty eight and so you have these one where they had the the new little girl the kids from the original movies the the two that she was babysitting had grown up in like in parts takes you a ... plane an older Tommy oil and this was in the nineties by that point\nAnd while those things do fall apart very quickly I mean part for is interesting in part by okay and parts six is a mess but I I appreciate them trying to do what they tried to do in part to sex but parts six is tough to watch\nBut then the next three boot comes in Nineteen Ninety eight when they did a Halloween age too well and here's where it starts to get really confusing because\nThey had Halloween one two three to four or five and six all follow the same story well age to always a sequel to Halloween too and they bring back Jamie Lee Curtis so this is the well the third movie she did but technically she had done\nFor because she shows up as a voice on the phone line in Halloween three\nBut she doesn't have a partner with Laurie stroke but this is her coming back is Laurie Strode on our member of being a big deal because it was Twenty years later age too well and this is a pretty good solid horror movie it reeks of the nineties and it feels like\nThat sort of dawson's creek heart that you got what stuff like the faculty which are fun\nAnd and now that we're Twenty years out of those they can work as ... for the nineties but it you know ten years after it was it kind of suffered a bit but it's holding up now in in the south to look at nineties Har so each was actually really pretty good not as good as the original but it's still was a good little re boots\nAnd then they did Halloween resurrection which tanked hard that one was terrible that's what Busta Rhymes doing it and this was by the titles I think two thousand two\nAnd and Jamie Lee Curtis shows up in that movie very briefly but gets killed right away\nAnd and that was sunk lower than episodes sex\nAnd then they said we're just going to rebuild the whole franchise so in two thousand close to two thousand and it was I think two thousand seven\nIn episode six and then they said we're just going to rebuild the whole franchise so in two thousand close to two thousand and it was I think two thousand seven that robs zombie did his categorically terrible ... cause he completely miss understood\nWho Michael Meyers was the terror of Michael Meyers was it was the average everyday normal kid\nWho was a psychotic murder and that's what was so terrified he just made Mike Myers into this white trash hobo family that was abusive and mean and and and so the terror of what's he becomes isn't that core of evil and\nAnd then and then it goes completely off the rails with with Halloween to the sequel that rubs off those are terrible I'm anything that's better than those I think is a step in the right direction\nSo that brings us to forty years later we get the third time the series has been boosting gets removed and we'll be talking about that at the end of the next break along with the movie the oath on fat guys at\nThe movie [noise]\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred thousand or more of an vegetable assets this may be the most important in sixty seconds for your retirement we're sound income strategies and we transform typical portfolios\nAnd that's all that's [noise]\nWhat did he do laid a copy of the fire and fortunate for that is so not a legal\nHoliday I knew\nNothing about this movie when I saw it in fact the only thing I knew about it as I'd seen the poster and and if you look at the poster it looks like some sort of like\nIt's like it's a functional family romantic comedy\nIt's not it just wasn't overtly political movie and and you need to know that going in it's directed and written by Ike Baron Holtz and he's come out and said he's the guy he's from the Mindy project and he was in the neighbors movies and he said he this was a direct response to Trump ism uh in in Trump as president and and it is definitely\nPlaying off of that sort of comes with a political point of view\nBut that's not necessary I mean it's what it's about but that's not what the movie become here's the thing it's about the loyalty oath that people are supposed to sign by the day after Thanksgiving and there's a department of homeland security that are in in ... the gates and here's the thing\nIs at one point this is about politics of Thanksgiving and look in a couple of weeks we're all going to feel this ourselves we're all going to go to banks giving dinner we're all going to interrupt and do a big political argument or we're going to have the person they're yelling no politics have dinner\nWith more interesting about this movie is what happens after the big family fight is when the authorities come in for something and how quickly it escalates\nAnd and why it escalate and challenges you if you can get past the politics of challenges you to think\nWhat would I Do in this situation what is too far when do they go too far when does it overreaching what would you do and where would you draw the line and it's a good point to ... I like you said it's overly political but\nThink of it and this turns even if if if you agree with the politics of the movie find go in and look at it as that but if you disagree with the politics of the movie looking at and saying what if there was a loyalty oath for the guy that I didn't like\nAnd just sit there and say oh well then you're supposed to be a thing in the past one ever do those that's not that's out of the realm of possibilities there's other things in this movie where they show just nastiness on the streets when people to people and ... and those are real things that happen you see I'm On Facebook can you see him spread through viral videos\nThe very things that are being shown in this movie and even though this department of homeland security parts doesn't exist\nYou can see where overreach can happen where things aren't handled properly and when you put somebody in a position of authority over somebody else\nThey have a potential abuse their power and they may not be the best person to handle that and they can escalate\nAnd work and go from there and it can get ugly and the loyalty oaths\nThose things exist and you know proven did it to the Japanese internment camps I there was a loyalty oath going around during McCarthyism and I mean now there's like things within like political rallies here and there that have shown up but I mean\nYou know you may be able to like okay I agree with the guy who was in office but what if the guy he's you don't agree with an office you want to have a loyalty pledge then it look we're one big terrorist attack away from a something like this you just throw patriot in front of it and that's how we got the Patriot act which has some great things in it but there's some nuts\nAnd here's the tack away from a something like this you just throw hatred in front of it and that's all we got the Patriot act which has some great things in it but there's some not so great things in the Patriot act and that he got pushed through after nine eleven\nThat's I think what this is about it's about a bigger picture outside of currents partisan politics of the day so I'm going to say the rocks as well [noise]\nThat's it but the thing that I Need to go to a break when I come back and what are we talking about an evening with Beverly ... when the box office in the homes that I'm Around the teacher and in in the

here\nBut what are the things that I Love about the show Larry and I get really amped up for this we chat about it a lot will be getting ready for the show and the show is a ton of fun to do and how can it not be a ton of fun when we're just talking about ways where we can really generate more income inside of the financial markets and\nWe usually start to show off very similar way it it's all about consistency cars at that point never change right that point never change it's all about consistent income it's not about\nMaking money once right it's about making money over a period of time

more income in our lives\nCount on not something that well hopefully this works out raised up that that step by step process that can generate more income in our lives whenever we're focusing on the consistency side of things\nWe also have to take into consideration well we weren't consistent income we need to have a consistent strategy the market goes up down in the market also could go sideways right an unchanged market lately we've been having a lot of that down market we've been having a lot of those\nFour hundred point down on the on the U.S and people haven't or foreign point down on the

this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call\nA traders market and it's a traders market because it kind of those by and hold situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market is kind of\nRocking back and forth it's something that can be very simple but also very lucrative and so what are some

back we just mentioned you know you've had this volatility in the markets and most people who don't know what they're doing a freaking out right now because they see the market goes down then it goes

free tablet dot com\n[noise] welcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobson director instructor development and top instructor it online trading ketamine shed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more\nMoney we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down or sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities degenerate into give generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise and it really is important to remember that\nThe more that money is made on the way down just like the money has made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of gains on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combine so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B\nRight billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they are looked at as a a a not so they looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money no a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though\nWho look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they have that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's kind of the situation our income in retirement accounts or in if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why\nIt's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nAbout how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn where we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money at the market going down we start doubling up on this\nStuff no absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they started trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives and it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some education a little bit later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the pie\nSome educational a bit later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population\nWere Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money and what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students as I ask them a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it people who start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires\nWe discuss this right have a an average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that trading has like a system what's his system\nIt stands for save yourself stress time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well most people either don't know how to do this\nOr are afraid to do this and honestly they keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talked to my students give me an example mc ... used to work in the workplace he quit he want it to work for himself\nHe wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks do and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys but I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education and learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family we'll just leave a job you don't like any more\nKnow so many times individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time is money right and that that's what you're talking about earlier as is exchanging just time and getting a wage right getting paid for our time now\nThat the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money\nHow can we make money work for us rather than like what you're saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate or the the financially independent from the financially dependent out there are those multiple streams of income and a lot of that comes from having our money work harder than our body is working and that\nThe whole time is money concept is something that I used to uh\nUh I used to say all the time and I worked for my dad's construction business I had an hourly wage and everything like that and so it was very normal thing for me to to to to to equate time with money but it started getting into investing I I I realize how bad of a mindset that actually is that how easy trap to fall into because it's what we've been told our whole lives\nBut we really what we have to focus on his wrists or reward and having our money work harder than our body one of the ways where we can help a few people get started on that later if you're up for it as we can do a quick little give away with some of these tickets we got here let's do some more giveaways right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area to have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent income up down or sideways\nSupplemental income or primary income inside of the financial markets thought about having that money work hard rather than your body work hard\nRight now the half day classes

markets included with your passes to the half the class is going to be our professional insiders kit packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing your

if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ free tablet dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nBut there are multiple types of income that we're just kind of touching on there but we have the passive income we have the the active income we have the a supplemental income we have the primary income was kind of the hot topic out there ... ... what do you see most people getting excited about as far as different income streams in the market\nRight now well the biggest thing they're realizing is by we help our students design a financial trading planet blueprint so to speak and again it doesn't matter what your background is what's your experience with trading is how much money you have it really is all about how committed you are to changing her life and doing something very very different hopefully you can see\nHow this can possibly benefit you in the long run but so many of our students have come in they had a lot of head trash emotionally thinking the only way they can make money was to be out there and work second or third jobs and again\nMost of our students come to the academy because they're looking for freedom yes it's about making money we want you to make income but at the end of the day what could that extra time mean to you do you have time to volunteer would you prefer to go part time and do a job you didn't want to do give you an example you know I'm about to talk about Gabrielle a\nSingle mom she came in right\nReally really concerned she wanted to put her two kids through school very very nervous wasn't sure she could do this\nAnd not only was she able to do this and learn rather quickly she was able to put her two kids to school but bought herself a new car so the thing to keep in mind when you're starting to consider these things one it's not a rich get rich quick schemes you're going to learn how overtime to generate money\nIf you're somebody doesn't want to be stuck where you are right now a lot of people just get stuck in life\nOkay it's not going to be for you if you're not coach herbal you got to be open minded that there are people out there every single day making money and doing exactly what you do and the question I Would ask grind of all this did was really earn some extra money wouldn't be worth it\nRight right well and and then ties back into what can you do with that money as far as giving you that financial freedom and and do and maybe the fun things that you want to do it it's kind of interesting over the last little bit of as we've kinda got ready for our big conference that we do every year you know we we chatted with a a bunch of different students and start talking to them about what they what they want to do and it's amazing to me how many of our students love\nKayaking like over and over and over again like what do you do now with all the spare time you have kayaking I was like whoa we'll kayakers there are other thing when they were oh they do that the ... orders ... they're all real fit and I'm like oh it's pretty cool but yeah it's it it really just\nIt's always buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics are ahead of my class last night as as the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape\nBut getting printed off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high and somewhere along the lines\nWe kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible forced to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income account\nIt's it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identifying a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and ah there's this guy Dan that ah when I first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remember it I won't share it out there but it was just kind of funny you say you can't live or stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are\nRight but for some reason we fall in love with potentially invest the end of this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about us at all and and honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and\nDoesn't care about us they don't care about it on and honestly why would they write and Larry you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my account except for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares\nRight there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going man I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account the replaces somebody who is closing their retirement they have this perpetual kind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual fund or we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in the situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up are falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have their class coming up in your area that the cost of ... ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half the class including with your past is going to be a professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now\nAlso is a thank you for taking that half the class online trading academy is going to give you a Kindle Fire tablet so you can access online training academy educational information anytime you want colors century twenty are gonna receive to free passes to professional insiders gets one for you and one for a friend and when your ten you're also going receive that can do fire tablet\n... twenty when you just call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight\nNine seven four eight seven to three that's AAA eight nine seven four eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at ... ... dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow now Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside but also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down absolutely a little a lot\nOf our students have figured out they can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth that can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they can do this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are frantically waiting for it because it could be one of the best years of our lives\nLike people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks when they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again but most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the ...\nIt's been happening over and over again but most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in and the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R.\nIt's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so if all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capitals so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested would not be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is richer award how what what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nWell your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half their classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time well what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points have returned to your your portfolio every year because really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out of this after class\nBut the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your four one K. and you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nYou know it goes back to some of those are some of those phone calls the way I always like to throw out in here as far as you don't have to be and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah ... I used\nTo always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great and unless you do oh you just want a Ryan's as you don't want to spend your\nGolden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one you know and and it's all that we have these fun cliches things that we love to throw around but they've been around forever 'cause they're true right\nWe heard him so many times 'cause they're true no nobody ever says will know you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have to have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and and I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days\nAre raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary right but it is a lot of fun and trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine imagine if\nImagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people in the class they gotta have tickets we gotta do give away\nLet's do it All right right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area that the economy really where you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account growing whether the markets are going up down or sideways now include with your passes to the half the class is going to be a professional insiders kit\nIt's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors now the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right now also as a thank you yes or attending a half day class on a train economy is going to give you can do fire tablet so you can access on a trading academies educational information anytime you want colors sense you're twenty you're going to seek\nTo free passes you professor was that it gets one for you in one for friends and when you're ... you're going to get that can do fire tablet center twenty would you sell now in reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight\nNine seven four seven to three surely nine seven four seven to three if you end up being callers nine or forty one sorry about that but his ... dot com and see if you were ...
