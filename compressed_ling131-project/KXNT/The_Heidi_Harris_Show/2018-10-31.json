there's tests now a that no matter how open minded we are we're all and we all have unconscious biases ... every time we talk I'm curious how did you get the idea to do this piece\nIt was really interesting I saw a book that came out and I I get a pitched a lot of books but uh this one was by a very prominent a researcher someone who is a\nNew York university stern school of business professor who social psychologist who studies implicit biases and so the research was solid um and that caught my attention it's a very\nInteresting topic but it's also a very timely topic so that's how I came out it\nWhat are the ... that we that we have\nSo we all have something and this is this is not the external biased these you know some people have external ones they you know some people are proud of that\nBut we're talking about even the people who we all want to be good right so even people who feel like I'm very open minded I live my life and it's very uh open way welcoming to everybody we have these sort of deep seated\nAssociations really you associate a certain type of person with a certain kind of thing and so we have that and and so the research and this is not one little study this is a body of research over years\nVery well research thing or the research shows that you know a lot of white people the majority of white people um have biases against black people and I'm Talking about the association so they're these computer task you take these computer tests and they\nTest your reactions are very quick reactions to something and with people take these tests they tend to associate black faces with uh the were bad negative words with weapons they associate white faces with good and with neutral objects like a chair\nA so that's what's going on and the really odd thing or surprising thing is even black people tend to do that so\nUh some some black people not all do also hold these\nBiases we have by a few for women women should be at home women are warm or we associate them with home we associate with men with working science these are the type of biopsies I'm Talking\nAbout so if you're sitting there saying look I'm I'm not racist or you know I Am not sexist perhaps you're not budge you are having a reaction whether you want to admit it or not in science is showing is that\nScience is showing us so what they want to exempt given the article
