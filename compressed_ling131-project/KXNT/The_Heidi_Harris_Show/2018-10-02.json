is a interesting announcement on Amazon said it's going to raise its minimum us\nOn hourly wage to Fifteen bucks an hour\nNow remember this is the company that has come under scrutiny and an assault almost ... by because people say oh my God the working conditions at Amazon or so awful blah blah blah well now this new Fifteen bucks an hour it starts November first it covers more than two hundred fifty thousand\nJust think about this on the federal minimum wage is seven twenty five an hour Amazon's pay more than twice that\nHow is that going to affect others in a you know for instance in in their various locations or go to\nA big distribution center here in Las Vegas is going to be you know grabbing up everybody ah with with their competition\nYeah I think so on and look this is going to be really interesting because look at uh at at where you um have competition where maybe it's UPS or FedEx Justin those temporary workers they're all going to have to compete now with Amazon and you know this is really I think just an incredible on\nState statement about what's going on in the labor market because frankly it's hard to find people and if you were working at a place say that like maybe working at a brick and mortar retailer and you're making twelve maybe you were making Thirteen bucks an hour\nYou know that's decent but then you're under the sort of the the\nThe ... the fear that the retailer could downsize her clothes and now you got this huge growth company that's essentially saying we'll pay Fifteen bucks an hour now some of the other competition Walmart\nWhich employees by the way a million and a half people in the U.S\nOn they're going to raise their hourly paid till eleven bucks for all us employees targets similarly eleven bucks okay they're gonna raise their their minimum wages by you know say eleven maybe up a couple of bucks but now Amazon is doing it right now\nSo I mean this is just a big statement which is we have got to get people to work here and the way you get people to work as you pay a more\nWe are talking with just was CBS News business analyst from Jill on money why are they doing it is it basically the bottom line because they can't get people I mean most most votes looks would say that you know who's covering business\nOr they can pay more they just don't want to and they just don't is that going to be changing is is especially with some of the other stores that you mentioned right now is this the trend we can look forward to\nI think so I mean look Amazon is out front okay it there's no doubt because already they have for on some of their lower wage employees the benefits are pretty amazing they've got comprehensive health care and they've got a four one K. match as many as twenty weeks of paid parental leave\nBut I think this is a statement about how quickly this company is growing and how would understand that\nUnless unless you are going to pay up you're not going to get workers and this is a real commentary on Amazon's own growth potential\nLook maybe some of the other big guys will do it and maybe you'll have some of the mid level folks really get squeezed out of the best workers so it's a pretty extraordinary move is again\nYou've got to remember this is a global workforce at Amazon five hundred Seventy five thousand employees\nAnd you know and and again two hundred fifty thousand is in the U.S\nI Want to put this in perspective in twenty eleven\nThe U.S workforce at Amazon thirty thousand it's now two hundred fifty thousand that means they need more people as fast as possible to keep up

Obama administration for trying to mess up this election\nSo he they immediately thought of political rather than the CIA doing their job as sounding alarm\nAbsolutely and this is just one of many many behind the scenes moments that we capture in this book\nOne of the important things are to a politically whatever side you're on when you hear you know Obama did very little well he did very

the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration project yellow light noise and the ad council [noise]\nWake up Las Vegas [noise]\nWell we know that the investigation into Kavanaugh is continuing\nSo one of the\nSudden remembrances of a bunch of people who knew him back in the day Charles Chad ... is a friend of Kavanaugh's at Yale and ah he came forward to talk to reporters yesterday\nYou really did this line one more time I unfortunately believe that some\n... springs is flying\nI'm seeing their own missions there were certainly many times though he could not remember what was going on\nWell no matter what it turns out that Mitch McConnell\nIs going to have votes anyway despite a whatever happens out of this FBI investigation bill writes on CBS News correspondent\nIs joining us this morning and it seems it doesn't matter what comes out of this investigation they're not going to come to conclusion is not their job with the with the FBI but Mitch is moving forward\nWell that would be the indication at least at this point Michael the president is putting a\nBrave public face on saying that uh the FBI needs to investigate what it needs to investigate and he wants it to be thorough within reason is the ... but I guess uh you can define that are any number of ways but what we do know at this point is that the FBI has reached out to Deborah mirrors they have reached out to a\nJudge in fact they began to interview him yesterday we understand that interview is going to continue today\nUh as far as uh Julie sweat Nick Michael ... says ah through CNN last night that uh he uh his client has not been reached out to buy the FBI as of yet although the day is young today\nWe could see that to the point about the vote Mitch McConnell says that the investigation by its scope was only the last week and he still does intend to hold a vote on Kavanaugh on friday\nA so that is the intent just remember last friday he intended to have the votes to proceed and then uh have the actual vote on Kavanaugh was supposed to have been today so\nIntense or one thing reality is another I suppose what's\nThe feeling right now with those on the fence we're talking about like we're talking about Murkowski we're talking about Susan Collins all Republicans uh there's some indication that our Dean Heller here in Nevada may be\nA swing back and forth on whether or not he is behind Cavanaugh is a is there a worry by McConnell that that that enough of these guys are going to say no that has a huge\nWorry huge worry a that he that uh you know are there and particularly uh talking about Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski who are under pressure back home about this sort of thing and you know what they have to balance is what comes out an FBI report and that's why I think everybody is holding their breath\nOr to see what comes out of this now just to remind her the FBI report is not a criminal investigation is just an information gathering effort they're going to talk to witnesses put it in a report\nAnd give it to the Senate Judiciary committee and they're going to have to decide what to do with it at the end of the day so uh but yes I think\nThey want to see how the wind blows with this report before they figure out what to do because ultimately ah we're in the middle of mid term she got potential control of the Senate at stake here so everybody's watching very carefully how they're going to go on this vote and for those people who are on the fence and maybe Heller included at this point I'm you know it's\nWatching very carefully how they're going to go on this vote and for those people who are on the fence and maybe Heller included at this point I'm you know it's it's not an easy decision to bake\nIt also is a clouding up the president's a victory lap that he was trying to do yesterday on this a trade agreement with Mexico and Canada which ah sounds a lot like YMCA what is it U. M. C. L.\nOr us us MCA yeah I've got a United States Mexico Canada agreement is there an app for that yet and it's not yet not yet but I'm sure somebody will come up with one the Internet has brought in [laughter] somebody will have one but look\nTo your point I mean this is a legitimate victory for the president this was one of the major things that he campaigned on yesterday\nAnd he did he brought everybody up to the rose garden at a huge crowds standing behind them but you know is trade people homeland security Jared Kushner standing off of his left shoulder and he wanted to take a big victory lap and the last thing you wanted to do was be dogged by these questions about cabinet but to be fair\nHe did answer them and uh he addressed them a\nL after he got very personal with a reporter which I just thought was unfortunate\nHe did and the White House later came out and said uh and we're talking about the silly Vegas ABC um where she said he said to her that you're not thinking you'd never think a paraphrasing there but the White House later came out with the transcript that said no actually he said that that's OK you never fact\nI'm okay [laughter] um but in any case it was one of those situations where now he's done it was a seal your bagel last week he did it with our we Jang inside the East Room [noise] and uh it's just we could do without it let's just put it that way\nWe could and also the Republicans can do without it because this is the year of the woman there's enough or women problems going on right now with the Republican Party especially taking look what's happening with Kavanaugh and the president just needs to think both\nWhere he talks sometimes right before I let you go to hang on one second Twitter account refresh nope he hasn't treated anything you can go to bill right off the B.
