and dropping the bits on people's heads the audience members who left the theater with bits of paper and their hair probably wouldn't agree with the boy on the best part of the play\nNeither would the custodian in charge of cleaning the theater afterward\nBut when Jay and bury the creator of Peter Pan heard the boys comment he was delighted he wasn't offended that the boy hadn't paid closer attention to the play instead he considered it one of his favorite reactions to his work\nAll of us have to deal with decisions made by others their words actions and attitudes that could be considered offensive this can be particularly difficult when we feel that the\nValues and traditions we hold dear or being rejected or even mocked but justice someone might choose whether or not to do something insulting we can choose whether or not to be insulted we can choose to give others the benefit of the doubt\nAnd not assume malicious intent behind their actions we can love people even if we do not love their choices after all isn't it more important so perhaps more challenging to love a person than to love words were actions\nAccepting people does not mean approving of work condoning their decisions it does not mean waving our own rights to think and act differently\nNor does it mean we will never feel sad or hurt or disappointed but at a deeper level we can be at peace if we focus on love for love has the power to overcome our disappointment\nFrustration and pain and who knows our love me even soften a heart but even if it doesn't the best approach is still to Let Love

temptations of one kind or another that keep coming back no matter how hard you try to dispel them I Can't promise you that acceptance of Christ crucified\nWill solve all of your personality problems all will solve any of them immediately but this I say with complete confidence\nMaking the cross of Christ your own will change your whole outlook on life it will bring you into a relationship a friendship with God the kind that God wants to have with you it will give you got his chance to make you more and more the kind of person that he intended to be and that's pretty

written I Will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the ... the prudent will I reject what consider what have the philosopher the writer and a critic of this world\nTheir show for all of their wisdom

mindedness of the gospel message\nFor the Jews ask for me reckless proofs and the Greeks and intellectual panacea but all we preach is Christ crucified stumbling block to the Jews and share nonsense to the ... but for those who are cold weather Jews are gentile\nChrist the power of God and the wisdom of God amen [noise]\nYou're listening to the loo through an hour and we just heard the message from Dr Oswald Hoffman first preached in Nineteen fifty five talking about the rapid pace of technology I'm joined here in the studio by Dr Tony cook director of us ministry cigarette Lutheran our ministries\nThe rapid pace of technology has not slowed it all has\nI remember when I was a kid I Lived out on a farm on the middle of a cornfield we didn't have air conditioning we didn't have cable TV\nWe didn't have a cell phone we didn't have an answering machine at one point we didn't have computers you know anything like that\nAnd think of where we are today it was like I was living you know like life on the prairie [laughter] something like that and then then all of a sudden those technological advances started and they started to you know kind of multiply ... speed I'm starting to get to that age that I'm thinking\nWell I'll just let the next generation deal with that I can remember when the Internet came out\nI had this thought that well I'm sure that's just kind of for kids I really don't need and mom about it now today you know how it's going to permeated everything so yeah a technology I think is an amazing amazing gift but it it does make your head spin and it also\nBrings questions of of morality and and usage and in how we're using things appropriately or or inappropriately as well\nDr Hoffman speaking back in Nineteen fifty five said things are happening so fast it's impossible to get a grip on them before they slip away replaced by something new and better and that's the same thing we could say today what does that mean for Christianity for the church\nBut it's interesting er here at the losing our we use technology a lot to um to get the gospel of Jesus Christ out into the world\nBut I'm not someone once said that the Internet is where religions go to die\nReally yeah and I it's kind of an odd what do they mean by that well I I think that the the point is that\nWhen you have a faith of any kind um that's talked about on the Internet you're exposed to all the other ones ... and you're exposed to people from all these different belief systems that they know this was the right point to notice is the right point or my ways and here's the proof or this or whatever it might be\nI think it's partially because of the fact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody\nFact of um exposure and as I go back to the beginning of this when I grew up in the middle of a cornfield I wasn't exposed to anybody other than the six hundred people who lived in my town you know but now every religion every bought every philosophy that exists in the world comes to you\nAnd I think for many people that is a challenge and they don't know how to necessarily think through those things so I I think it's important on the one hand that as Christians that we use technology in a way that gains a hearing for the gospel of Jesus Christ\nAnd that proclaims that gospel in a way that um is clear maybe even more than it has been in the past because\nWe can assume that people understand the message of the church anymore I'm with all these competing messages that are there so on the one hand technology is this great tool\nFor us to use to communicate the gospel but also it presents challenges with other ways of looking at things sometimes that can be a challenge\nOr just for people who might not be as as strong in their faith or thought about their faith that might challenge them as well I'm not that we should pull out of technology\nBut I'm understanding who we are and who's we are and being able to articulate our faith clearly as we confront these diverse messages I think is extremely important with all of this technological change\nAnd as much as technology continues to change what remains the same is God's love for us in Jesus Christ and we've reached that message each week you're on the program\nAnd that's kind of beauty I think of Christianity is the goalposts really never move [laughter] it's a ... a Jesus has already kick that ball and and that game has been one of 'em and for us\nThe message is the same the message that because of Jesus Christ\nThat the love of God is here\nFor you that the kingdom is here for you that there is a place that has been prepared for you by God in God isn't your enemy is not against you he wants you to be with him forever and his kingdom and that comes through\nThe crucifixion and the resurrection of Jesus Christ and while things are changing you can never change that that's something that his his historic it's something that's happened and it's something that regardless of what you're facing you can always go back to and say this is the one thing that makes the difference\nAnd in that crucifixion and resurrection we find our identity then as as people have got\nA and this is the kind of the beauty of it it almost a ... not only beauty but it's it's like a beautiful mystery to me are identity being connected to Jesus that in our baptism that death that we talked about that that that saves the world from soon\nWe are connected to that death\nSo in our baptism we die and we rise with Jesus and our identity is directly connected to the identity of the son of God and so when you worry about who am I a in these changing times or how do people perceive me on Facebook and all these other a technological platforms\nThe real question that we should be asking is is how does God's Ears\nAnd God sees us in Jesus our identity as him and him we have a diet and risen with him and when he looks at us he sees through that death and resurrection of his son and he loves us and he cares for us any forgive us and he wants us to know who he is\nThe same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously ... and by\nAt the same time that message is not an easy one it's perceived as foolish both by those who take religion very seriously ... and by those who don't Yeah Dr Hoffman talked about that the uh the foolishness of the message\nThat the that is being preached and yet that is the message that contains the power of God for saving us\nYeah it's interesting 'cause we talk about the Christianity is foolishness I'm On the one hand a person could say that and you think well that's a horrible thing to say I'm sure that's not correct\nBut if you ever take time to look at it you know I guess it [laughter] um it it's foolishness to our human way of thinking really the wiser person in the world would not have come up with this is a solution to the to the problem is and you know\nSo you think that okay sin came into the world and the solution is that God is going to sacrifice his son Jesus and that belief in that Jesus in in that son of God in his sacrifice is somehow a Tony for us\nThat doesn't make sense it just doesn't make sense and and so when you try to think about it a cognitively with your mind or academically or treat it like math or science or you know something like that in dissect it\nThis has been a presentation of Lutheran our ministries ...\n\nFrom the

back weeks where we've been able to have Larry Larry Larry in Studio on the radio with us\nI got Larry Jacobson here Larry how are you doing doing great Ryan how're you doing this way of doing awesome and for our listeners out there Larry is the top instructor it online trading academy and the director of instructor development\nSo it's easy to see why usually referred to him as the brains of the operation out here\nBut what are the things that I Love about the show Larry and I get really amped up for this we chat about it a lot will be getting ready for the show and the show is a ton of fun to do and and\nHow can it not be a ton of fun when we're just talking about ways where we can really generate more income inside of the financial markets and we usually start to show off very similar way it's all about consistency cars at that point never changes right that point never change it's all about consistent income it's not about\nMaking money once right it's about making money over a period of time and having that consistent stream of income that you can count on friday you can count on not something that well hopefully this works out raise that that that step by step process that can generate more income in our lives and whenever we're focusing on the consistency side of the things\nWe also have to take into consideration well we want consistent income we'd have a consistent strategy the market goes up down in the market also could go sideways right an unchanged market lately we've been having a lot of that down market we've been having a lot of those\nFour hundred point down on the on the U.S and people can have a foreign point down on the Dow and even the other day you know another foreigner points backup and so it's almost like a a a reminder of of springtime back in February we had the big drops in the big rallies were stuck in this area of volatility again is which is one of the things they call a traders market\nAnd it's a traders market because it kind of those by and hold situations can be a little bit painful and so having that consistent approach of being able to get in and get out as the market is kind of\nRocking back and forth it's something that can be very simple but also very lucrative and so what are some of the things you guys are doing right now Larry with your instructor team really help people kind of harnessed this volatility and generate that consistent income inside the market's great question right you know at first and foremost I just want to say it's so great\nTo have some people listening and a lotta times are students

visitors on line at oh gee a free tablet dot com that's OT a free tablet dot com\n[noise] welcome back if you're just tuning in you miss Larry Jacobson director instructor development and top instructor it online trading ketamine shed some light on consistency in the markets were talking about generating more\nMoney we're talking about generating more income whether the market's going up down sideways we're talking about how much the market dropped a little bit ago you know it's been about a week or so since we had the big drop in the markets but when you look at those opportunities they are they are that they are opportunities degenerate into give generate more income and essentially give yourself a raise\nAnd it really is important to remember that the more that money is made on the way down just like the money is made on the way up and so really we wiped out number one we wiped out three months worth of games on this last market drop\nIf we didn't know how to make money as the markets were falling if you do know how to make money as the marks were going down if you have that skill you're able to generate as much money in a week as over the last three months combined so it ends up being these great opportunities as one of the reasons why\nWhenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes billion with a B right billion with a B come out of it\nDuties as one of the reasons why whenever we have a market crashed there is a new wave of billionaires that come out of it yes ... billion with a B\nRight billion with a B come out of it and a lot of times they're looked at as a a a not so they looked at with not such a pleasant light we could say because when they made all that money a lot of people were losing money no a lot of people were losing money in there and those are individuals though\nWho look at a down market as a bad thing now these individuals that were turning themselves in for millionaires and billionaires\nThey were looking at a down market as an opportunity they have that skill set they had that knowledge they knew how to approach that down market\nSo to think about a job if you had a job where you got laid off one third of the time that wouldn't be a very consistent stream of income but a lot of times with the Bush biased with only making money as the markets are going up that's kind of the situation our income in retirement accounts or and if we are reliant on just one simple direction the markets go up down or sideways\nAnd if we only make money when the market goes up well there's two thirds of the time two thirds of the direction where where especially laid off or we're not allowed to go to work and so that's one of the reasons why it's very difficult to follow kind of that classic just simple bullish biased and have consistent growth you look over the last nine ten years we've had this great bullish move\nAbout how much opportunity has been lost on those down opportunities how much opportunity was given back in two thousand eight when the market crashed and if we don't have that skill set going forward this could be the beginning of this next big downturn where we could give back fifty or sixty percent of our retirement account how 'bout instead of that\nInstead of going through that process again how about we understand how to make money is a market going down we start doubling up on this stuff\nNo absolutely you know it's funny because one of the things that most people don't understand they start trading on their own and they make mistakes all the time and here's why the number one mistake most people making their lives when it comes to trading if they want to try it on their own first and then maybe get some educational ... later on well here's the problem that most people don't understand\nFive percent of the wealth right now is being shared by Ninety five percent of the population\nWere Ninety five percent of the wealth is shared by five percent of the people so that means there was five percent of us who have understood the right way to trade how to make money and what's really scary right now and I talked to a lot of students as I asked him a simple question\nDo you work for more money or just money work for you and most people are working for more money they always believe that they're going to get ahead if they're going to find their freedom and let's face it\nPeople who start trading are people looking for multiple streams of income and most millionaires we discuss this right have a an average five income streams\nThey're doing so not because they're working harder they're working smarter they're figuring out how to work right and what that simply means is if there's a way to learn how to generate income without having to put more effort that's the best way to do it and most of the time\nPeople don't understand that trading has like a system what's the system it stands for save yourself stress time energy and money love it if you learn how from professionals to do things the right way there's no reason why you can't be generating income as well most people either don't know how to do this\nOr are afraid to do this and honestly they keep going out there in thinking that they're going to attain freedom by working more and more well most people I talk to my students give me an example mc ... used to work in the workplace he quit he wanted to work for himself\nHe wanted more time with his family well if you can learn a skill that will allow you to make money the same way the banks do and you've shared district me many times Ryan J. P. Morgan Chase had only nine losing days in the last five years\nI don't know about you guys but I Want to be on that team that keeps making that money and the only way you're going to do that is by investing in the education and learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family or just leave a job you don't like any more\nKnow so many times individually\nEducation and learning how to do that can you see how this could help lead you to spending more time with family we'll just leave a job you don't like any more\nYou know so many times individuals get caught up in the rat race and you start hearing people use phrases like time is money right and that that's what you're talking about earlier as is exchanging just time and getting a wage right getting paid for our time now that the thing that we always like to focus on his money is money Ryan how can we make money\nHow can we make money work for us rather than like what you're saying working for working for money and that's really what starts to to to separate\nOr the the financially independent from the financially dependent out there are those multiple streams of income and a lot of that comes from having our money work harder\nThan our body is working and that the whole time is money concept is something that I used to uh\nUh I used to say all the time and I worked for my dad's construction business I had an hourly wage and everything like that and so it was very normal thing for me to to to to to equate time with money but it started getting into investing I I I realize how bad of a mindset that actually is that how easy trap to fall into because it's what we've been told our whole lives but we really what we have to focus on his\nOr reward and having our money work harder than our body one of the ways where we can help a few people get started on that later if you're up for it as we can do a quick little give away with some of these tickets we got here let's do some more giveaways right now we've got to have to class coming up in your area that the classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really generate that consistent income up down or

kind of touching on there but we have the passive income we have the the active income we have the a supplemental income we have the primary income was kind of the hot topic out there ... ... what do you see most people getting excited about as far as different income streams in the market\nRight now well the biggest thing they're realizing is by we help our students design of financial trading planet blueprint so to speak and again it doesn't matter what your background is what's your experience with trading is how much money you have it really is all about how committed you are to changing her life and doing something very very different hopefully you can see\nHow this can possibly benefit you in the long run but so many of our students have come in they had a lot of head trash emotionally thinking the only way they can make money was to be out there and work second or third jobs and again\nMost of our students come to the academy because they're looking for freedom yes it's about making money we want you to make income but at the end of the day what could that extra time mean to you do you have time to volunteer would you prefer to go part time and do a job you didn't want to do give you an example you know I'm about to talk about Gabrielle a\nSingle mom she came in right\nReally really concerned she wanted to put her two kids through school\nWell you know just you know I'm about to talk about Gabrielle a single mom she came in right\nReally really concerned she wanted to put her two kids through school very very nervous wasn't sure she could do this and not only was she able to do this and learn rather quickly she was able to put her two kids to school but bought herself a new car so\nThe thing to keep in mind when you're starting to consider these things one it's not a ... get rich quick schemes you're going to learn how overtime to generate money\nIf you're somebody doesn't want to be stuck where you are right now a lot of people just get stuck in life okay it's not going to be for you if you're not coach a boy you got to be open minded that there are people out there every single day making money and doing exactly what you do and the question I Would ask grind of all this did was really earn you some extra money wouldn't be worth it\nRight right well and and then ties back into you know what can you do with that money as far as giving you that financial freedom and and doing maybe the fun things that you want to do it it's kind of interesting over the last little bit of as we've kinda got ready for our big conference that we do every year you know we we chatted with a bunch of different students and start talking to them about what they what they want to do and it's amazing to me how many of our students love kayaking\nLike over and over and over again is like what do you do now with all the spare time you have kayaking I was like well we'll kayakers ear or the other thing when they were oh they do that the ... orders like they're they're all real fit I'm like oh it's pretty cool but yeah it's it it really just\nAlways buy low so high it has been for a thousand years it will be for another thousand years that that has never changed and that was one of the topics were ahead of my class last night as is the markets don't change the marsh don't change we look at it on a phone\nInstead of looking at it on a on a on a ticker tape\nBut getting print it off right but the market still don't change it's all about by low and it's all about so high and somewhere along the lines\nWe kinda got distracted from that and I think the average investors out they're investing their money on payday and they plan to sell when they're sixty five and none of that has anything to do with price and so if we're not buying it a low price and we're not selling at a high price it's pretty much impossible for us to make any money now one of the fun things about the markets whether it's your retirement account or whether it's your income and count\nIt it's the same right it's it's all about just identifying a low price and buying and identify a high price and selling\nNow we get kind of caught up in this whole emotional back and forth of maybe stocks that we love her or or or things that we want to be invested in rather than being invested in the right things and and ah there's this guy Dan that ah when I first started trading I I I did a lot of work with Dan he was a a great friend ... you know acted as a mentor and many different kinds of aspects\nAnd Dan used to always say you can't live your stocks they're never going to have you back and he would talk about and he had a little story to help you remembered I won't share it out there but it was just kind of funny he would say you can't let her stocks they're not going to have you back\nAnd think about it if you're invested into a company right now it doesn't matter what it is if you called them up they wouldn't even know who you are right\nBut for some reason we fall in love with potentially invested into this company who number one doesn't know who we are number two doesn't care about us they don't care about it on an honestly why would they write\nIn there you're talking about you know taking care of our retirement accounts and how nobody's going to take better care of it than we are and and it's it is true and the reason that I firmly believe that is because nobody has to live off of our accounts except for us right nobody has to live off of your account except for you\nNobody has to live off of my account except for me and so in the end as kind of courses that can sound nobody cares\nRight there's there's not an institution out there that they that they stay up at night going man I Hope I Hope John and Mary have enough money in their retirement account\nYou know what they say that because they want to make sure they have enough fees being paid to them as long as their monies in their retirement account but every day there's a new twenty two year old that opens a retirement account replaces somebody who is closing their retirement status perpetual\nKind of ... income stream that comes from that anyway so at the same time though we stay up at night right the average person\nHas many sleepless nights over money but how much time as the average person spent getting educated on how to make sure their money is growing right I I find the financial markets very interesting because we go to a a car dealership and there's a car salesman there and we really don't take his advice on what we should buy but yet we go to a car dealership\nThat has the uh financial institutions name on the front of it where they're selling mutual funds and we take the cells persons advice to heart we go well he's the professional in this situation\nNow with a lack of education that's kind of where we end up are falling behind the eight ball and the financial world one of the things that we can do is we can help a few more people out with that because we still got some tickets we can give away let's do it\nRight now we've got to have to a class coming up in your area that half the cost of ... ... exactly what it takes to really take control those retirement accounts and have them growing generating more income whether the markets are going up down or sideways\nNow included with your half day class include with your past is going to be a professional insiders kit now this is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right

colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at ... ... dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry still kind of on this retirement check I Know there are a lot of people concerned about growing their retirement how can somebody number one protect against this potential downside but also inside of their retirement account is there a way for them to continue growth as the markets are going down absolutely a little a lot of\nOur students have figured out that can use other type of leverage assets to actually start accumulating wealth well our stock market isn't a downturn so this great ways that students can protect their wealth that can hedge against it they're learning about options\nAnd that's why they can do this three hour session to understand what's possible in the marketplace I can tell you firsthand talking to our students students like myself and you too we've been waiting ten years for this correction think about that\nMost people are dreading a correction we are frantically waiting for it because it can be one of the best years of our lives\nLike people don't understand that again the markets go down there is an opportunity to make money just as the markets go up so imagine learning a skill right now to preserve your capital where you can lock in profits imagine you did that back in two thousand eight\nAnd you had money sitting in cash waiting to buy those bargain basement prices of stocks and they got back to two thousand nine well this is going to happen again it's been happening over and over again\nBut most people continue to do nothing and wait for something that happened like I said again the cavalry ain't come in\nAnd the reason why so many people are poor P. O. R. it's just they're passing over opportunities repeatedly so if all this did right now by spending three hours of your time is help you learn how to preserve more capital so that you can retire and the lifestyle that you're interested would not be worth it\nYou know we always look at things in the investing world is restored how ... what do I have to risk and what's my potential reward\nOr your investment in this case is going to be about three hours worth of time or half day classes about three hours long so that's your investment that's your total investment is three hours worth of time so\nSo even if you were to say that's your total risk is three hours worth of time well what's the potential reward what if you ended up generating another source of income what have you ended up adding another couple of points have returned to your your portfolio every year because really your risk is the only time as far as you're investing three hours of your time to come out of this after class but the rewards are potentially limitless that's a pretty good ratio\nAnd imagine that you learned for the first time that you've been in the wrong things in your mutual funds and your ... can you can learn how to reallocate to give you that rate of return that you that you really want that's what a lot of students are really excited about\nKnow it goes back to some of those uh those unquote so we always like to throw out and here as far as you don't have to be and I'm going to do this one wrong or you take it it's yours ... yeah I ... I used to always say you don't have to be great to start but you got to start to be great\nAnd unless you do all you want to Ryan's is you don't want to spend your golden years at the golden arch absolutely I Love that one you know and and it's all the way over these fun cliches things that we love to throw around that they've been around forever 'cause they're true right\nWe've heard him so many times 'cause they're true no nobody ever says well no you you don't have to get started in order to be great you know you do you have\nTo have to be great you have to get started but you don't have to be great in order to get started right it's awesome and and I love doing uh I get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days are raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross this\nI get involved with a lot of different races were actually doing a charity race in a in a couple of days are raising money for cancer and and I always compare it to just a race you have to cross the start line before you can cross the finish line it is necessary right but it is a lot of fun in trading investing you can take this really whatever level you want but imagine imagine if\nI imagine if it just made that slightest impact in your life to the positive how worth it with a three hour investment be now before we can get people in the class they gotta have tickets are we gotta do give away\nLet's do it All right right now we've got a half day class coming up in your area and that costs really where you'll be able to see exactly what it takes to keep their retirement account growing whether the markets are going up down or sideways now include with your passes the half the class is going to be a professional insiders kit it's packed with lessons from some of our top instructors now the professional insiders kitten makes it so you can get started right\nNow also as a thank you after attending the half the class on the train economy is going to give you a Kindle Fire tablet so you can access on a trading ketamine educational information anytime you want colors century twenty you're going to seek\nTo free passes to professional insiders gets one for you in one for friends and when you're ... you're going to get that can do fire tablet center twenty would you sell now in reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight\nNine seven four seven feet three that surely nine seven four seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that his ... dot com and see if you can force [noise]\nAt online training academy our mission is to offer exceptional financial education so you could live the life you've always wanted maybe it's just having that peace of mind so you don't have to worry so much about the bills or even just having the luxury of not working so hard\nTo have more time to spend with the family graduates of online training academy share it with us all kinds of stories here's one one recent graduate had to say\nI bar tended at a casino basically they're open twenty four hours a day seven days a week and so I hadn't had a Christmas off and maybe eight years I hadn't seen my mom for Christmas and she abruptly passed away and that's when I you know I knew I needed to do something different of needed my time I needed my life\nAnother student says ... happy and career and try to make something that I had always wanted there and so as I said that but at a chemical or start that changed my life\nLearn more visited on line ...

fifties sixties seventies eighties so if you want to feel better if you want to feel stronger this is some very important information we're going to cover today\nYou know this is an exciting topic to talk to me about this important message today what molecule are we talking about and how it's impacting the lives of people who follow the science\nRight right right well we're talking about her new supplement it's cold every strong and it features and exciting molecule called Korea Team now had a lot of our listeners may have heard of ... and I know you've used Korea teen right but for those that don't know about Korea teen it's mainly use\nIn the Olympic circles professional athletes body builders college high school athletes because it does something extraordinary and what I'm about to tell you is proven by hundreds and hundreds of human studies so here's where Korea Team does for us\nHelps us to get stronger more powerful helps put muscle mass on the body and it helped protect us from losing muscle tissue\nAs we get older we know that's a big part of aging not only that pat great for the brain great from memory and it helps promote bone strength as well so an amazing molecule that everybody needs to know about\nIs an amazing story you can you share some of the science and tell us why you're calling Korea teen one of the best kept secrets to healthy aging\nOffshore pat what we need to understand with Korea Team is that it's a natural molecule to the body it's in every single cell tissue Oregon in your system\nIts job in the body is to generate and maintain strength and power that's a reason for being to maintain strength and power it's an every single so on the body Ninety five percent of it however is in your muscle tissue because that's where we tend to use it the most the powers of the muscles it's good for strong muscle contraction\nAnd it's important to help maintain strength and muscle contractions when you're using them over and over again for instance if you're working at the gym if you're playing sports golf tennis anything like that it keeps your muscles\nPowered up in their high energy state\nSo they're strong and ready for action packed here's the key is is so important for those of us say in our fifties sixties seventies\nYou see we had lots and lots of Korea Team when we were young we had one of the stuff that was coming out of areas we had lots of creating our bodies made a lot of it but as we get older like everything else we don't do that is well we have less Korea teen in our muscles you know the good news is that\nHundreds and hundreds of human studies show that when you supplement with Korea Team they go to work or go straight to your muscles it's absorbed easily it pumps up at the Korea teen in your muscle tissue\nAnd you get stronger you get more powerful not only that it helps port memory and brain health and it helps support the strength of your bones\nYou know we were talking before the show and you were talking about how eliminated athletes have been using Korea Team for years to enhance their strength and performance and tell me more\nWell this Korea Team is the premier sports nutrition supplement there's no question about that pat you've used it body builders know about it athletes know about\nKorea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic\nOh there's no about athletes know about Korea Team is the premier sports nutrient so you know back twenty twenty five years ago the Olympic athletes and their coach is of course you can do about it they knew what made you bigger and stronger and faster they knew was natural to the body it was supposed to be there\nBut there were a little bit afraid to supplement with it because they were afraid it might be considered cheating let it might be considered too much of an edge\nBut back in Nineteen eighty eight the international Olympic Committee\nThey came out the officially confirmed and I'm quoting here Korea Team can be used by athletes to enhance their performance and now ... it's not just for athletes anymore because the studies are clearly showing\nThat for adults for people in their fifties sixties seventies this stuff it was amazing and purity has this incredible new formulation\nWe call it ever strong because that's exactly what it does it helps you get stronger and stay stronger with hundreds of human studies to help you and it's the purest form of ... money can buy the stuff from Europe this stuff is fantastic\nAnd we should point out that naturally occurring in red meat problem is in order to get the amounts that are going to benefit you you'd have to eat large amounts of red meat and like four pounds of red meat a day most people are going to do that right and what about vegetarian they can be creating deficient\nExactly when I have a vegetarian that comes in here and their energy efficient they don't feel the way we don't want to feel\nYour brain or an soak it up like a sponge and it increases your Korea teen phosphate reserves in your brain so now in your brain you have more readily available resources to do was to recharge\nThose neuronal batteries to make more energy inside the brain so basically what do you notice what your memory is supported and pat scientists have done some amazing research here they found the people that take Korea teen\nSupports their memory it actually helps the brain to utilize oxygen better it supports memory and people that are sleep deprived it's been shown to help people add numbers quicker and for longer periods of time without mental fatigue get this study pat\nJust five days five days of eight grams of creating supported mental tasks in subjects that we're getting rapid fire question scientists were asking them\nMath questions in science questions over and over and over and they found the folks aren't Korea theme didn't fatigues quickly\nMentally so this is amazing stuff it's like a turbo booster for your brain it's like a super charger for your muscles that recharge is all your cellular battery so all of your cells tissues and organs have more readily available energy\nOr dark I loved that ever strong appeals to athletes and people want to get more reps in the gym maybe get some extra power and their workouts\nBut you're also saying there's a big push a nutritional community to encourage people in their forties fifties sixties seventies even eighties to leverage the power of Korea Team to stay fit strong and healthy like you say\n... going mainstream you know I share the story with you before my mom who's in her late seventies now she's taking creating she works out a couple of days a week three days a week she goes to the novel is does the free weights because she's got osteoporosis she wants to maintain her muscle mass and she wants to make her bones stronger and as you pointed out creating helps to do that\nAnd then the other three days during the week she'll go and she'll swim now she's not trying to get bigger stronger or anything like that but even at her age Korea teen has benefits\nOh yeah and what blows me away about that story 'cause you\nThat her medical doctor recommended for your team for and that just goes to show\nHow much more mainstream this is it's called every strong\nAnd it supports the muscles that supports your power your strengths your speed if you're an athlete you're certainly going to love it but even if you're not an athlete you notice the difference let's go to another study one more review study this out of the journal current aging science December two thousand thirty and I thought this was very cool\n'cause the researchers looked at the body of research out there on creating and seniors\nExercise they want to see what happens when seniors take Korea teen and they don't\nBeen exercised so I'm quoting here ... supplementation without associated resistance training seems to enhance muscular strength power and insurance increase lean body mass for those that don't know what that is they're talking about muscle and improve the functional capacity of the elderly\nThey go on to talk about how it supports bone health as well and then they finished with this creating supplementation without training in the elderly could potentially delay atrophy of muscle\nUnproven difference and strength so here again we see bottom line pre teen is very very effective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health\nEffective it's gonna help you to feel stronger whether you exercise or not it supports your strength and power your brain health and on top of that it supports your bone health I mean ... when you think about it this almost sounds too good to be true right right\nYeah you're a person that never heard about this and you're listening to us you would think this sounds too good to be true\nIt is true hundreds and hundreds of human studies back up what we're talking about you're going to love the benefits you get with this ever strong formula\nThat's incredible let me remind everybody they can get a free bottom of the ever strong formula today plus the bonus bottle of twelve energy melts\nJustify calling us at one eight hundred by eight zero eleven Seventy five you just pay for shipping that's one eight hundred five eight zero eleven Seventy five will give that number out again later in the ... eleven now listeners can only get ever strong this clinically tested Korea teen blend from surety products right\nOh absolutely I Know it combines decree a teen with the vitamin D the coffee buried the fruit ... be more on him for those who don't know talked about how these work so well together there was a a synergy and it's also a great value to I Know we have a free bottled today but if you wanted to buy all of these things separately it would cost a small fortune wouldn't it\nOh absolutely I mean if you went out and bought the Korea pure create and that's a purist finest pre teen from Europe if you brought that and then you went out and bought a separate antioxidant formula and separate joined formula and the vitamin D and it's going to cost you eighty Ninety a hundred bucks a month\nBut you're not going to spend that today and that was purely products and your name or going to spend a half that you're not spending forty five fifty because today\nIt's for your job is to be one of the first thousand callers\nAnd take it seriously this the flies out the door and the big radio stations be one of the first thousand cause you could you be twelve and ... and your average strong you're just pay six Ninety five for shipping we want to get it right out you know\nWe want you to try this out we want you to be the judge for yourself don't take my word for it try it look in the mirror go to the gym lift some weights play do whatever you do see if you don't feel better\nAll right let's talk about how you take this you have these easy to swallow tablets which are super easy to swallow it also comes in a very refreshing Sherry Barry powder so how do you like to take and it gives people just choose the tablets are the powder when they're calling for the free bottom today\nYeah yeah you can choose tablets are powder I personally use both you know I'm I work at days are days and making a a protein shake on days I'm juicing let's face it juicing has become a very big these days so if you're doing something like that to a jury very powders fantastic could just take a scoop\nDump it right into your juice dumping pure protein shake and that's a great way to take it but if you don't do that stuff I mean the tablets are super convenient they're small they're coated they're easy to swallowed it's wonderful stuff\nNow I Know you're shopping at the bit to tell us a little more about this study the purity did on the ever strong powder they tested golfers already found out that not only with these golfers getting stronger and more explosive but they were driving the golf ball get this\nFor teen yards further that's amazing\nI have such a big smile on my face right now I'm remembering when the researchers came back and gave us information I mean we were bouncing off the walls this is so exciting the researchers call this\nA seminal study in sports nutrition and this is on our average strong formula\nThe product we are talking about right now the average strong power so double blind placebo control study thirty golfers took the ... powder for one month no exercise nothing different just took our ever strong power for one month in one month they were banging the golf ball\nFor teen yards further pat not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nFurther pat not only that six percent more power on the bench press more explosive they could lift the weights faster\nThey hold our guys spend hundreds of dollars on new clubs to drive further\nSo job where you had five hundred dollars on a driver yeah five yards right this is for teen\nYards ... people shouldn't just how how about this or you're on about this this is amazing because let's face it this was a golf study but more explosive and there's more speed more power this should help all sports so if you're a tennis player if you're a jogger if you're any kind of an athlete this has ramifications across the board but again\nThese golfers one month on this ever strong powder we're talking about today banging the golf ball fourteen yards further can you imagine pat you get your bottle of ... you don't tell your buddies take her for a month and you go out and you're banging the both fourteen yards past them they don't know what hit him\nWow I Would just had a few minutes left here I Want you to recap this amazing story today about Korea Team you like to call the molecule of strike who needs it and what about this double free bottle offer today with the ever strong plus the B. twelve energy metals\nYou know what pat my one concern with this show is it literally it sounds too good to be true right like when I tell folks about every strong right I'm afraid they're going to think I'm making this up to not possible right you know I Know how you feel because six seven eight years ago when I started to read about Korea teen\nI almost couldn't believe it I said to myself\nIf it's really this good with an excellent safety profile how everybody is not using it but I started to use it and I noticed some incredible benefits it's just phenomenal and it's as simple as this you're going to get on the strong\nYou're going to try it you're going to get stronger you're going to get more powerful you can look in the
