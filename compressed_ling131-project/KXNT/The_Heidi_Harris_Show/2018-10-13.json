lighting control that gives you the ability to set your rights to come on at dusk so your family can always ride back home to a well lit space but first we want to hear from you what is that project you'd like to get done give us a call right now one eighty money pit\nAround and came to the you've got the money they were happy today\nYeah I have a a home with across space and I've had some moisture under there and and the older when they built that he ran a runoff\nFrom the roof down into the French drain diverted that and it's helped a lot but it's still moist\nAnd I'm asking if ah they calculated systems or they trench the perimeter of the inside of the cross space and and a seal off the systems there with him in a fire in the south up and how they work unless fetch a solution to these kinds of problems\nLike in Pennsylvania and let them staying on the roof tell us what's going on there\nYeah I have or are they are they are there parts of their roof on my house um myself ah area as well as my neighbors have these black\nStreaks um it seems to be a part of the roof it doesn't get a lot of uh Saturday I added my question was um\nYou know if I guess first of all what what is it a second way is there a way that I laid out by itself as a homeowner or do I do I have to hire somebody to do so if they let a St Paul\nWell generally those streets were made up of algae or moss and they have more frequently on the north side of the roof because it's a cooler side of the roof and there's more she'd there\nAnd a product that you could use to address that is cold wet and forget it's concentrate you mix it up you spray on the roof and then slowly but surely it kills\nThe algae kills the mosses kills me ... there and cleans the roof and so within a very short period of time you'll find that the roof which brings shiny again\nOkay that that product come at a I'm a ... look at it the two of those are you actually do have to get up on the roof\nDon't believe it does I think you have to mix it up and put it in like a pump Springer okay\nAnd so you may have to get up there just spread downloaded to follow the instructions their website is wet and forget dot com\nYeah and it is a product that once you get in on the surface you know over time it continues to work so it's not something they're going to have to reapply very often so it is worth it if you can get up there to you know carefully spat\nOkay with that also uh I I had the same problem with the siding on the northern part of my house it's a lot of that\nYep absolutely could use reciting for sidewalks and improves and you know the nice thing about what forget it as it doesn't damage and landscaping\nOK okay great great OK well life I greatly appreciate the advice that get very much\nYou're welcome good luck with that project thanks so much for calling us at eight eight eight money pit\nWell within like one hundred square feet of floor and you can get the silent any room of your home but using flying

big impact for relatively small expense and it can bring a very cool and very durable sort of artistic element to your decor\nNow you can use many different form materials for this project use hardwood bamboo or the would look tile and luxury minor even laminated it all works well for that acts of wall say in the bedroom like maples wind the bed or in the living room or a family room and look really good\nNow get pat on the type of flying planes can be at the church to them all using nail glue or even went flying tape\nNow you're also going to want to make sure to let that flying acclimate in your home for a few days before you start your project and to get the layout you want to know range those planks side by side on the floor first and balance out the color or look at the green pattern really sort of move around and be happy with the luck before you get into the wall\nNow here's a tip when you're ready to go you went and saw the first point starting at the bottom left corner in the wall area and then work your way from sort of left to right and this this is a good way to make sure that you were given a good mix of the patterns on the wall you also want to have a half inch gap\nFeeling in the floor which is a little bit of room for the Florida naturally expand and contract and you can easily cover that over my molding you'll have a beautiful new very trendy space and really just a one day project\nAnd that can they still kept presented by lumber liquidators with such new trends in Hartford flying in so many options to choose from your shore to find what's right for you to get experts flying how that every local store\nLocations call one eight hundred hardwood or visit one ... dot com lumber liquidators hardwood floors for less\nMary in North Dakota need some help with the concrete floor and luckily for him wake\nCounty laying concrete at eBay far okay ... path right and it may have ... ... ... and at that pace that fat guy ...\nDo you want to try to stabilize the deterioration of the concrete\nYeah that kind of hair and I kept a bag of part of that ad\nYeah absolutely first of all in terms of the water problem this is a problem that happened after heavy rainfall yeah All right so you've got water that comes in after heavy rainfall I Want to make sure we try to slow this down so it doesn't happen again having some pumps things of that nature is not going to stop this from happening again what stops the heavy rainfall from getting in\nHis outside looking at your gutters and you're grading making sure that down spouse or discharging away from the house thanks you guys were clean Mickey's were soils slips away from the house we've got an extensive articles actually several of them on a Monday but dot com just search how to stop a leaking basement has the same advice\nAnd we talk about the proper drainage improvements so do that first and then in terms of the country itself you can use of patching compound\nQuick ... has a patch in compound product you definitely want to use the patch and compound because it's designed to stick to the old\nConcrete if you tried to put new concrete over it it's not going to stick\nSo they're ready to use patching compounds are trial applied there latex formula so it's easy to clean up but that will seal the old concrete one says dries then you can painted\nAnd what I Would look for is in the ... floor pain or the Toxie pain so I liked because there there are chemical cure when you buy the floor paint you get the paint and a gallon can that's about three quarters spilled and then a court of partner you mix them together stir them off\nAnd then you apply the pain sometimes there is um an attitude that goes in after the fact that gives you some texture to the floor and helps kind of hide the dirt but patching first than having an epoxy pay will have that looking like new in no time\nOkay but it looks like a car wreck\nQuick preachy U. I. K. R. E. T. H. quick creek concrete patching compound good stuff Mary thanks so much for calling a set a date money pit\nI got that Richard in Illinois and the line is getting some water I mean the foundation tells what's going on\nWhat it is it over time I've got a ranch house where they walk out basement and on the walk out when you come out there is a retaining wall but\nIt was about eight foot tall were meets the house it hasn't really separated from\nThe house but there is water they get into the twin retail end up on the Asian and then they read it bottom on a heavy rain and then teach back into the basement so I'm trying to figure out the previous owner that had this houses\nPut something in there like a call ... got hard with time and\nIt's not falling down too much\nThis is a gravity situation so let's give you a gravity solution let's have the drainage work with you and not against you and by the way you can steal this so the cows come home and it still does\nAnd it's way in which you have to do is stop the water from accumulating so in the opposite side of this retaining wall I'm guessing that there's some run off that goes towards the wall yes there is\nSo what you're going to want to do is is intercept that run off so we don't get as much for the collection that area where we want to try to do is limit the amount of war that gets in an area that just direct rainfall with no runoff that means\nNo gutter discharge no a runoff from higher elevations\nSo the way we do that is is first of all examine the situation and make sure there's no water dropping\nAt the high side of this war could work its way down if there is you've got to run a pipe underground to get it to a place where it's not going to interfere with ah with leads into the basement secondly in terms of intercepting the run off what you could do is installed something called a curtain drained Richard it's really it's a rather simple drain you might construct yourself\nYou take a trench that's about twelve inches deep in twelve inches wide you put some stone in a trench then you put a purported type on top of the stone surrounded with more stone\nLed if he's a filter cloth across the top and covered with soil so it's all done it's invisible in the end of that dream that you just installed should exit the daylight somewhere so you figure out the best way to do that they send the configuration of your yard will that will do is they'll intercept the water that's coming down from higher elevations\nFor the phone and the trench come up to the pipe and then run around the house as opposed to collecting in that particular corner\nIf we can keep the water from collecting in that area you will probably be just fine because it's rare that just direct rainfall accumulates enough water to actually leaving the house it's almost always the runoff from gutters and from drainage\nRight well and they look to fail to do so you get rid of landscaping this gets a\nLittle green book along along that well as well so\nYeah and that's a good point because sometimes you can make the problem worse by having landscaping that traps water so just think in terms of water control here not in terms of trying to steal that water out to be in good shape\nAri thanks so much for calling them money pet now\nWinning a breakdown in your home you know that life can come to a screeching halt

happening in your world today\nOnly a couple of pieces of news that I really wanted to focus on this week in the first one is about James Gunn now of course if you remember earlier this year he was an ceremony asleep fired by Disney as the director of guardians of the galaxy three even though he had already worked on a script and they were in pre production\nAnd it was because of these old tweets and there are offensive tweets but there were twin city than out as as a you know there were bad taste jokes but they were jokes they were not real tweet of real things he did\nAnd it was kind of a hit these because this was picked up by like a conservative blogger who was like I think he was angry at the fact that James Gunn was very critical of President Trump and his policies and and that's his own right to do that but\nThis guy then kind of created this outrage out of nowhere and\nHad people say oh how dare you you know make you hire this guy because he directed the movie for kids talking raccoon in a tree and isn't this terrible that you're letting this person make jokes about pedophilia and rape and you're going to keep them on the project\nAnd people overreacted people went after him and then just the knee jerk fired him which I thought was a huge mistake by Disney mainly because this was behavior that took place almost ten years ago before he was even affiliated with Disney he\nThis is not something he was doing like this weekend it was something he had done in his past and he has grown as a director and he had to apologize for me and actually brought it up back when he was hired for guardians of the galaxy one what five six years ago\nBut because we live in an outrage culture where everybody wants to knee jerk and get offended at everything people are weaponize ing outrage you that's not a good thing I feel for James Gunn I don't think he should have been fired for that yes it was in bad taste but he apologized any change in behavior it's not like he\nDenied it and deleted it and then said that didn't exist he ... he owned up to it he changed his behavior and he's not doing that anymore\nAnd it was just jokes in the first place this is the industry that lets Mike Tyson star movies a convicted rapist yet James Gunn who make some bad patient and yes there are in bad taste and I was hoping that Disney\nWould quietly rehiring him but I think a lot of eyes are on him and I think they're waiting for a little bit to try and do that but they may not have a chance because rumor has it that were brothers\nVaccine subject to availability

effective playing football and hacks for beer lovers Sunday Morning at five on news talk a forty AM accent the [noise]\n\nAnd we'll come back to fat guys at the movies with Kevin car let's jump into the movie reviews with our first movie first man I'm going to start off by reviewing it but then I Want to address the controversy that came earlier this year and I I didn't carry the leaf very well with pie\nComplains already last segment but you understand why I say it's a stupid controversy and this goes back to sort of the weaponized the\nOutrage for dumb reason but it well let's talk about the movie first let's get that out of the way because I think let's talk about the movie as clean as possible and that is first men Oscar winning director Damien ... takes us very intimate look at a Neil Armstrong ...\nFirst met a woman [noise] every something [noise]\nWe've chosen a job so difficult requiring so many technological development [noise] we're going to start from scratch [noise]\nNeal flight is down in history [noise]\nWhat kind of thought so you have about that are planning on the flight being successful [noise]\nOn the world [noise]\nFor the record I'm not a huge fan of Damien shows that I thought that whiplash was a fine movie I didn't think it was the greatest movie ever I thought that the victim and certainly deserve the Oscar for it\nBut they're the movie itself wasn't the greatest movie ever although I Know some people who think it was the same thing with la la la la land had its moments I thought la la land was fine\nBut it's certainly absolutely was not the best severe absolutely was not the best of the year and certainly wasn't the best directing of the year I'm Emma Stone is quite good in that Ryan Gosling was fine but the the the God da ... action to la la land was overblown in my opinion\nSo first me and I'm not coming at it saying oh I Love his director I Can't wait to see what he does max I kinda was trepidation about seeing this film because I think\nShe sells the kind of guy who can get over blown over rated very very fast you sort of like a more intimate version of Christopher Nolan who has a couple of good films but some very mediocre and some kind of terrible films as well\nI'm not Neil Armstrong's biographer so I Do not know how accurate that is\nBut the one thing I really appreciate it about how they made this movie\nIs they approach it differently than everything else if you want the right stuff go watch the right stuff if you want Apollo Thirteen do watch Apollo Thirteen there is no shortage of space race movies there's no shortage of astronauts as heroes\nYou want the shots of them walking in slow motion down the tarmac you're going to get that and other movies you don't need that here\nThat's not the purpose of this movie this movie is not to give it a hero shots not to say that they're not heroes yes they're heroes and all but the point is this and this is not\nThat just shy using astronaut it's showing a very visceral look what it was like to be one now down in Kennedy Space center down in Florida where I've been I've set inside a replica of the Gemini probe I've sat inside a ... a barely fit in\nCory capsule and the Apollo moon Munch all those things are tiny and they look like tin cans and they look like you're inside of an old fashioned radio\nThey do not look like spaceships they looked terrifyingly complex but ready to break any minute\nAnd they are very very cramped and the windows aren't very big most of the space shots in this movie and here's where the strength to strength of this movie are when they're doing the NASA stuff when they're doing the space or in the travel and the waiting and and the checking and and the adapting that's the great stuff\nAnd what they do they put you in right there with Armstrong or anybody else\nThe only way to make this any more intimate into Armstrong is to physically have put the camera inside Ryan Gosling face\nBecause he's in there all the time and it almost makes sure in the cat's with them so you see it shaking you hear the rumbling and you see the lights flashing and how confusing you can be ... and how cramped it is and how you how does this tiny little window the size of like a legal pad\nYeah they have a couple of shots or the grandchild especially when the Saturn fives going up and gave the Apollo Thirteen type shot of you know it was like ... rocket Judy ... exhausted and all that kinda stuff yeah you have a couple of those shots\nBut by and large this is not shot like a Michael Bay beer commercial it's shot and mostly in the cockpit in the cabin of these things in the modules themselves\nBecause that's what the astronaut saw and experienced and that's the value of this movie because you get a chance almost experience what it was like I I've not been a big fan of those like like seats that move kinds of sentiments\nBut I think this would be a neat one to be in to watch that way that's what this films about and and it really puts you in the in the moment and and and that's the best part of it and they're also seen them guys are going through the gritty ugly on appealing elements of training\nWhich you always see it's it's sort of even in like the right stuff it was sort of wins all the way they put it together now the rest of the film and this is what kind of bloated into to our twenty minute running time\nIs the home and stuff and the emotional stuff with the wife and the kids\nUnfortunately when you come to the space race movies you have the experience of the wives because it was affects us nation certainly back in the sixties and the fifties women weren't allowed in capitals they weren't going to send a woman in space back then\nBecause that's the way the world was so the only job a woman had a sign from a movie like hidden figures where you could take the human computers and make a film out of them you know and even then that was extremely sexist attitude that that toppled those women back in the sixties and seventies\nMovie like this\nAll you can do is have the wife kind of wringing our hands are not a whole lot for her to do 'cause there wasn't a whole lot for the wives of do it all and clear for you is good and she acts and she's fine in the movie\nBut there's not much for her to do and they they have to give her due diligence so that's I think what blows to the movie and makes it a little boring a lot of the interpersonal family stuff I to me that that that border lines on just sort of like the misery porn I was talking about with\nWith the stars born last year of you know fighting and him not wanting to deal with it but it does show the real pragmatic dangers in the real dangers and problems that they were facing and even just public relation problems that there are facing back in the sixties\nSo overall I'm going to say that the movie it kind of rocks can rocks [noise] now onto the giant controversy that came out earlier this year the fact that they didn't have the planting of the American flag on them and again that's ...\nAbout true they do not have that scene but if you're looking for American flags you find them everywhere in this movie there on uniforms they're on space suit there on the side of rocket ships that are behind astronauts during a press conference isn't even a scene of Neil Armstrong some reason the flag and there's a shot of the flag on the moon\nBut you don't have as you don't have them coming down and planting a flag with a choir behind them singing God Bless America because that's not what the movies about\nThe movie is not about fantasizing the hero worship of the space race the movies about what it was like to be there what you went through to get there and the danger that you are facing and the uncertainty and the claustrophobia\nAnd then the best isolation that you felt once you get there spoiler alert they make it to the moon and so when you get to the moon is vast than it's isolating the only person\nFor hundreds of thousands of miles so again this was manufacture fake outrage the fact that they didn't have this big heroic moments\nThat wouldn't belong in this movie would have been so out of place again it's not a Michael Bay beer commercials\nDon't criticizing movies if you haven't seen them go to the freaking movie and then criticize it as you want to seem inches out you know not a fan of him he didn't certainly seem rightfully so God Mac when people were complaining about this because he said that some of the movies about the\nDial back your

[noise]\n[laughter]\nThis is written and directed by drew Goddard who did the film cabin in the woods which is I think what he's\nNot what he's most known for I think new throw his credit's out they're going to be known as one of the like the screenwriter for the Martian\nBut cabin in the woods he directed which was a de construction of the horror genre and this isn't a horror movie this is a suspense thriller it actually feels like kind of one of those indie\nCrime nor thrillers you would have seen in the nineties you know something around pulp fiction time somewhere if you look at the Clinton tearing Tina run between reservoir dogs in pulp fiction\nWhere the maturing happened between those two movies somewhere in the middle of that is where you'd find bad times of the isle royale now it's got a great cast you got like Jon Hamm you've got Jeff Bridges\nYou've got Dakota Johnson who is actually quite good I become a big fan of ... partly through the fifty shades of gray series as terrible as those films are I\nI thought to go to Johnson really held around in those so so I I think she's good in this movie you got Chris hands worth it\nIt's a creepy movie because you know bad things are going to happen partly 'cause it's in the title but it it\nTakes us time to set things up in there and it's one of those ... ... it's like a bottle episode of a of a TV show where it all most of it takes place in this hotel and they have flashbacks outside of it\nAnd and it's told them that guarantee no structure where it says word until this person's back story than this person's backstory nobody is in there with a story that you would expect except maybe one person who is sort of the average person coming in but still has a little bit of skeletons in her closet but this is a um\nIt's a slow burn of a movie and it works quite well\nIn the grand sense now it does run a bit long it's a two hour Twenty one minute running time and I think this would have been observed if it would have been about two hours\nBecause there are some of the storylines take a little bit too long to delve into some of the storylines aren't as interesting as others and oddly enough I wanted to remote no backstory more on some of the storylines and I got kind of bored with the other story like one of the characters is a singer she's a lounge singer\nThere's a little bit too much of her singing a little bit too much featuring her songs which feels like I I think God or to doing that not because he's just sort of trying to keep that onto this actress but more of that kind of the way these movies were in the sixties and seventies they had these these musical break now on that\nBut I got a little bit tired of hearing nursing\nAnd there are moments especially in the third act where\nIt's being laid up for suspense but it does need to move a little bit faster so it's not a perfect film and it doesn't want a hundred percent hold together but overall it's different and it's creepy and if the actively done and I I I liked it a lot\nDidn't like it I thought this that disaster potential written all over it and it didn't end up having that it actually turns out to be a pretty good film quite enjoyable and interesting and worth checking out so I'm going to have to see bad times of the ...

popular now I mean nowadays people tend to get credit for it even if they are clearly writing for somebody else I mean the one people most know about it because it's been talked about in the last

when it's a famous person like that and that says with that means that it's written with somebody actually writing the book and they're just basically a lot of times that the person just

structured on history is everyone wants to be like and that is because\nHe is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how they're doing doing great Ryan how you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun doing the show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd what are the things we always focus the vast majority of our time and I would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets and\nOne of the things we always stress and I I Know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down and whether the market's going sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and it's individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold kind of bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that we hold up for a long time and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth just where the heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction to lead dependent and what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach a half day classier it on a train economy one of my favorite things is to really work with the class and get them to viewed down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as oh that's so bad because people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith right now is what the right skills those could be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the source of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up\nLast week has been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that the market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up\nIn the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success\nThey've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach being able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money is the markets are going down\nAnd also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental it'd be their primary source of income and I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call\nSource of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is the primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion Ryan you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy\nThinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over forty and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they wanna make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny I got him Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to the point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade would it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you tie it back to the half the class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish and so I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month and that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts\nWhere you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing and part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time has to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be through options that could be through stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say there is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about it like that that is that that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you\nJust get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income and it goes away well we're we're in her city right weren't stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we got a little bit of savings to buy us little time but it ended up being that kind of\nThat that that downward spiral or even just stuck in a rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nAnd you know as you're thinking what you're saying and you you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the frog if you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you can\nA couple of times the frog hits the top lid and he just that little way they still can't jumping the higher the way the lid was we don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or different definition of of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so\nFor years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make and now not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we want to do rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he say let's do it right now you have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive

that's\nAAA eight nine seven four eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ free tablet dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow as we are kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what's kind of that that that that's starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start people\nOff with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and it was ... once said as you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great so many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly well not at all in fact\nMost of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love\nBecause if we put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right we don't want to do that\nBecause we are looking for multiple income stream but at the same time you've heard this expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart\nWell that's not how people who make a lot of money I think\nThey're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent now\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love and sit there\nBecause you're going out and setting a second job yeah you make it a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income but if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management is going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right\nAnd that simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself and hopefully people are listening right now can see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money ran out of the gates and just you know I Want to I Want to take this dollar turned into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay that's not very realistic right but so one of the things we always like to bring that up as it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness in any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to have first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a a get rich quick program\nThen half the cost probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time\nAlso said to add to that because I Love where you're going you also can't be someone who doesn't take action you don't want to get to stay stuck where you are right now and you're not ... those are definitely things that are not going to work out for you but if you're somebody who really is interested in learning a new skill that can ultimately benefit you in the long run and this is an excellent opportunity for you\nTypes like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts so again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage that got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teachers students read out of the gate\nThat they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYou know you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big us in the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at um how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so\nKind of that average that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that yet about a fifty percent drum Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early to thousands fifty St yep same thing and so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kinda what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal\nBut the thing that I went through with my father about a year we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if we had a hundred thousand dollar account\nAnd they lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is that fifty thousand that happened in one year and that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take the average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty to take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan they don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself\nFool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the marketing locked in profit and then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash\nIt could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now it's a little bit at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nAbsolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify\nWhere to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow is get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got a half the class coming up in your area and a half the cost of where you can see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing how do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of a conversation will just second you have a chance to win a set of past as one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you

seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ free tablet dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried stayed on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat my dentist offices of the kid shut up to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and nothing against that poor people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs\nAnd so think about it you're at an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you invest in your money and all of a sudden the market corrects will that corruption is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into\nSo now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediately at sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture isn't housing dividend cuts vivid and cuts are all these things have a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and say this won't happen to me\nThere's a huge risk out there and then a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started\nEnded his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have their class going up in your area that day classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing make sure
