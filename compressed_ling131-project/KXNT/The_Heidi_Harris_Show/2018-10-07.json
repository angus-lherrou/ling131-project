do we're not going to be talking about politics or any of the craziness going on in our political world right now\nBut we are going to be talking about something that affects all of us and that is our healthcare now this is the season right you've got pumpkin spice lattes\nYou've got to worry about the relatives coming into town\nAnd we all have to worry about making sure that we make the right decisions for healthcare especially folks\nWho are having to deal with their Medicare annual election period\nAnd I can't do this all by myself I needed a ...\nMe out with all the facts and figures I don't want to lead you're wrong to joining us is Mary Granger human or broker relations manager for Nevada thanks for joining us thank you for having me first of all let's start off or above and talking about the Medicare annual election period what's the time period that we're dealing with\nThank you for asking every year between October fifteenth and December seventh Medicare beneficiaries not just seniors you can have Medicare if you are disabled are invited to explore their health care options before they're locked in for another year\nAnd that's the whole key this this is the key because we all know about it whether you do a Medicare or whether you you do regular healthcare it's that you and I were talking before he went on the air and it's when you get locked in to a program it can be so frustrating\nAnd and honestly I think one of the problems that I run into when I'm doing my regular health care and I think people go through this with Medicare as well\n[noise] the time gets\nYou know smaller and smaller and all of a sudden the deadlines there and you're having to make a decision and you haven't done your homework on this issue or that issue and you are stuck and you you can't pull out for for an entire year so this is really one of the big things that we're trying to do to make sure that everybody makes the right decision\nI agree you don't want to make a rash decision although Medicare does have a few\nAn action periods that might allow you to change your mind for the most part you're locked in for a year so all plants have been posted it Medicare dot Gov throughout the country and anybody on Medicare plan or considering the Medicare plan in the near future\nAre encouraged to at least go to that site if not one of their favorite carriers like humanity\nAnd explore what the plants are and what they have now and make sure they have everything buttoned up come December seventh which is the last day to make an election for January one\nOkay so Wednesday October tenth one day only six AM to six PM what's taking place\nWe're going to have a Medicare cue and they tell us on we're going to offer state license insurance agents who are extremely well versed in\nHow humans human humans this is a virtual slide real people real into\nPerson about people that will answer your questions without any pressure to make sure that year in the right place at the right time\nI Would want to tilt it would be very wise to know a lawyer before you ever got put in jail and I think the same thing applies to insurance you want to make sure you have the right insurance package emotion God Forbid something catastrophic hits you or your find yourself in an emergency situation\nLike in a you know\nCount the number of times I've heard friends and family as well when something happens and you never know when something is going to happen\nWhen you wind up at the hospital it's\nToo late at that point you need to have all of this is why they call it an insurance you need really it's a safety net\nTo to just in case\nYou you want to make sure that nothing happens you try and take care of yourself get plenty of exercise and eat right and all that stuff but your body has its own mind what it's going to do\nAnd you need to make sure that you do have that that kind of safety net like a circus performer or that you really have the feeling of to me it's it's just the feeling of tranquility that you know you've done the very best you don't have to be sweating it\nAbsolutely if we have\nOf time to plan a surgery or a minor procedure rarely does\nBecause the ice had been shot AT T's have been crossed and yes that hospital or provider is in my network and they will be paid but it's the emergencies that you need to prepare for well in advance\nAnd life is full of emergencies every day's an emergency or so for a Wednesday October tenth rehab\nFor one day only six AM to six PM we want you to call in the right down this number and don't worry if you don't have a pen right now or you're driving and and you need to pull over you have to do this when you get home because I'm going to be repeating it all throughout the show\nIt's seven oh two seven six six nine one three four seven oh two seven six six nine one three four and if\nYou don't have a chance to write it down all you have to do this is even easier\nIs go to our a K accent T. dot radio dot com website and just click on the Medicare help line a graphic that you see there there's a doctor and we have all the information that you're going to be needing they're one of the the biggest problems that I have from you know what I'm doing my health care and I think\nA lot of folks shows way and I'm sticking with that story I Believe I'm not alone a but especially\nSome of our ah our seniors that are going in and and signing up for a for Medicare\nIt can be confusing and and sometimes it's in language that you don't understand or sometimes you're seeing as like hold it if I Do this plan to do I have to do this and is this connected to that that's my big problem is when you click one button it cuts out another so\nThat is very getting there is is half the battle we're talking with Mary Granger she is Humanae broker relations manager for Nevada talking about the Medicare and you will election period and for one day one day only Wednesday October tenth\nFrom six AM to six PM or you're going to be able to call in and get all of your Medicare and a questions answered and there's no question that do stupid trust me\nI'm the guy who usually ask them the number that you want to call then is seven oh two seven six six nine one three four seven oh two seven six six nine one two three four and don't forget Medicare's and you'll election period as October fifteenth\nThrough December seventh this will be taking place both for that period starts this will be on October tenth\nThe whole point of this really is to make sure that you have the information you have the tools you are armed you are filled with knowledge you know more than the website by the time you go in and you start making sure that you've got all of the coverage\nThat you need one of the little things that you had mentioned we were talking about before sees the convenience care cost in coverage\nIs I went to the doctor this past year we go in quite a bit this one of those years we all have them we were just like okay what broke now a and that is if you have a situation that a doctor is looking at and you're going to come back in three days or a week or two weeks mentally I've decided this\nI've already done my co pay well no you're going back again and there's more and there's more and there's more you have to factor that in it's not like one one copay fits all\nCorrect and those co pays for office visits not for initial treatment and diagnose his yeah so you want to pay attention what is my maximum financial liability this calendar year should something happen and dying in and out of these\nOffices or complex diagnostic services or hospitals what\nAre some of the questions that people should be asking if it if it's not on your you know starting off your list just to get going what are some of the basics that people should be wanting the answers to when they're making their Medicare annual election\nThey should be asking do I have full Medicare and by that I mean Medicare and be do I have a plan and doesn't meet my need this year shit I explored for next year\nAnd by the way to 'cause this'll be me and I still do this when I hear the commercials and maybe you know the answer you don't if you don't know the answer asked the question no such thing as a stupid question what's the difference between a and B why do I need both isn't there see that covers all I mean you can ask anything they know the answer to\nExactly and that license agents that are receiving the calls are bilingual English and Spanish so they can fields lots of costs and lots of folks\nAnd when I was saying by the way they speak in plain English I mean we're playing Spanish they just peeking is speak in plain language that you understand in it and\nIt isn't over your head and here's the key to this is always really important and I'm Glad that these folks are doing this is that if you don't understand if they say something that you don't get tell them just stop and say I'm Sorry this just doesn't make sense to me it's okay they understand this\nI Would do it I Would do it too because what you want to make sure as when you call these folks seven oh two seven six six nine one three four on October to six million six PM\nThat you are armed you are feeling confident you're feeling sassy for change you finally know what is going on ahead of time so you don't have to worry about this any more this is something that I've gone through two when I've been doing my healthcare\nIs that you think you've done a really great job and then the year takes place and then you get those big surprises if you educate yourself ahead of time you don't have to worry or sink or threat like is this going to be covered you're probably going to do more than the receptionist\nI agree and I like to look at insurance in a worst case scenario so I Know what I'm On the hook\nFor at one time it's okay to be worst case scenario is definitely half empty\nYes just to make sure you have those proverbial ducks in a row um and there are several ways Medicare beneficiaries not just seniors can get Medicare the federal Medicare program is a beautiful program again it works from San Diego to Rhode Island in this eighty twenty fashion\nBut another way to get it are through these Medicare Advantage plans that were introduced in Nineteen eighty five and had been running strong sense\nMedicare Advantage plans is when you hire a company like Humanae and they assign co pays to all of those Medicare benefits you would get when you flashier red white and blue card mhm but they reduce your financial obligations or\nUm level of expense God Forbid there was something catastrophic that happened and then put in a whole bunch of extra I'd like to call it the advantage and Medicare Advantage\nTransportation services dental allowances for vision and eye glasses Medicare will ensure your eyeballs but they think eyeglasses are a luxury yeah they'll love you either\nWay the troops are run into it with my aunt before they do and it's just like why would this not be covered\nExactly sense and commercial plant I think that's a huge exception people entering Medicare think well it was covered on my employer plan so naturally it will be there and naturally is not right Medicare plans are different than commercial plants and you're going to want to ask those questions when you opt in\nJust in case it's not part of the plan maybe you're going to need exploring different insurance or additional insurance besides this but Medicare Advantage plans will give you exactly what Medicare does an ad quite a few additional benefits\nOftentimes for no monthly premium other than the cost of your anti intimate care\nAlright again we're talking with me a merry Granger shoes Humanae broker relations manager for Nevada talking about this and that is going to be taking place of Medicare help line of going to take place before this is important before the Medicare and you'll election period so when you go in and you start making your decisions\nOf between October fifteenth and December seventh you are so well armed is taking place five days before the election period starts it's going to be Wednesday October tenth\nFrom six AM to six PM one day only and you can call and get literally anything answered that you need at seven oh two seven six six nine one two three four\nLet's talk about how people can learn is it going up to this this event taking place how they can kind of arm themselves a little bit more what other ways can they get more information what websites\nYou so nationally Medicare dot Gov a ... it's ...\nDot com and every state in our United States has what's called a ship program yellow pages white pages you can\nFind that otherwise this morning on my on my porch your Medicare book uh no my my white pages I hadn't seen my outlook and it just isn't there\nIt is in there it is in there and then every Medicare beneficiary today should be receiving if not already a Medicare new handbook you can also find them at the libraries and the Social Security office\nAll right let's recap some of the things that that we have been talking about in case folks have been missing this or they wanted a ... to sometimes on these things are repeated\nActually everyday anything's repeated to be quite honest with you who is eligible for Medicare is there going in to this period maybe they haven't signed up before maybe they just need a a a reminder\nIf anybody has any doubts about their Medicare eligibility they should call Social Security but most people who are us citizens or have worked in the United states for at least ten years\nThey may qualify for Medicare and anybody who has Medicare part a and B may explore one of these Medicare Advantage plans come October fifteenth\nAll right and then also we\nKnow most of us when we were doing our health care and I think this the supplies most of the time there's some out and they're here and there you're stuck with your decision for a year typically yes [laughter] yeah\nAnd so what were the really the point of what we're trying to tell you is don't be stuck be confident it's sort of like you know I'm Elton John's come to town right\nAnd I know I Want to seal John So I Am going to make this decision in the click that box I'm going to get out my ... card I'm going to buy those tickets\n'cause I Know when I Need these tickets it's exactly what I Want to see so you want to make sure that when you go and you make that decision and you click that box that this is the exact decision that you want to me oh John Will help you with your Medicare though but I'm just telling you that that's how really sure you want to be when you go in and you make your elections\nCorrect and unlike Elton John tickets we won't sell out yes but it's important\nThat we make well I mean you know medicine can be expensive but still Elton can be a little bit more\nCorrect you just want to make sure you have a decision in motion by December seventh\nAll right so I'm against some of the initial things that you want to keep in mind when you are looking at your a Medicare coverage some of the most important things again you\nWe may lie and cheat or speak poorly of others to get the promotion we want or something else of value that we have placed the lives of others over we\nMay see those who are born with physical or mental challenges as of less value them those born typical maybe we think there must be a curse from God at play there the parents must have done something wrong in their lives to be given such a great burden yet\nThink this way we'd be wrong the disciples were so you'd be in good company\nAnd the gospel of John we recall the accounts of where Jesus killed the blind beggar in their travels de Jesus and the disciples pass by and saw a man who had been blind from birth and his disciples asked him\nRabbi who send this man or his parents that she was born blind and Jesus answered it was not that this man's sand or his parents but that the works of God might be displayed in him\nThis account serves to show how wrong we may be in our thinking for this man had a God given purpose\nWhen a life is created when we are blessed with such a great gift we may see it as merely inconvenient not worthy of having right now has this new life is it in a way of the plans we have made for ourselves\nThroughout the world about fifty five sixty million God given lives are taken by abortion each year\nThe arguments for abortion range from not wanting to raise children with birth defects to those conceived due to rape yet those cases are the absolute rarity among those who choose abortion twisted in the devils lies as we are we made no\nLonger see the value in lives created by God his children no less as worthy of protecting\nSin has caused us to become towel a sub scene in life as having great value from the one who gives it did as we are in our sinfulness we placed little value in lives that are\nLonger able to contribute to society or to us more rightly\nSaid it\nWas good could bring a disabled child into this world possibly brain\nWhat purpose does grandma or grandpa in their frail bodies offer or one with a disease that will keep them requiring chair for a long time stripping them of their ability\nTo be active citizen [noise] even\nThough it was my actions that caused a life to be created my life isn't ready to share with another so I'll just make this problem go away\nIt isn't really a life until it fully enters the world we hear today and until then we have a right to choose to do whatever we want with it we need\nNot look hard at a mirror to see how broken we are our thoughts may even shock us at times looking at strangers seeing how they are dressed or thinking of what little value they contribute judging their life as worth less than our own\nBut what if we are wrong what if our sitting written reason cannot be trusted and we were to give God the final say in our lives remember how we were once\nCreated in his image oh that image has been shattered but it is helpful to see how our natural inclination to hold self value above others in this world should be seen as a sign of sickness you see\nAll were and are created in his image I'll be at a shattered remnants of it\nAnd God loves us so much that he wants that all would be saved and it's his value for all of us just so great even broken and simple as we are there must be something to each life that he grants to exist and therefore\nWe have no business pronouncing a right to choose its existence or not\nAnd as Christians we cannot be complacent about this issue\nWe cannot claim to see God by his word to be followers and to not speak out against the hatred towards his creation that exist today\nPro choice is sitting in God's throne and making decisions that only he should make euthanasia\nIs also the same\nSure things are broken in this life and we can expect some tough stuff to enter our lives\nYet using evil for good as God does all lives how purpose we may not see it as clouded as our eyes have become by swallowing the devils lies but there is much to be gained by knowing the one true God as he\nIs you see God is a servant king\nEach action is one that is meant to draw us into a deeper understanding of who he is and how valued\nHis creation is to be seen\nThinking we know better in seeking control we'd be left looking at an eternity of darkness death and torture in choosing the devil\nAs whom we should follow\nYet wanting none of that God in knowing how we could never perfectly fulfill the laws that are best for us since his only be gotten son to save us\nAnd with him living his most perfect life Jesus then traded his life for our dead ones ones that deserve nothing but God's wrath and separation from him to see how\nLoved you are you must see how enemies as we are God still loves us enough to provide the fifth\nWas that even our lives still hold precious value to him all lives do\nAnd when we begin to understand how we have a father who still loves us and wants us in spite of our own defects maybe then we can see how his love extends to everyone everywhere and that they too are valued and deserved to know of his love also\nThose who God creates are no accident regardless of how they arrive in this world the blessings that we may see and loving those lives that we may expect to be burdens are precious in\nThe eyes of God those who need our compassion and service are there to teach us and they exist as lives that we may grow in love by and that is the real gift\nGod grant says to learn of how we too may love and in doing so may receive loved in return\nFollowing him we can expect is sinful broken world to bring with it trials and hardships yet we are made stronger and blessed to be in closer communion with him trusting as he draws us into deeper understandings of his plan and purpose amidst the chaos\nNow if you are listening and you have gone against that which God wish for you to have taken a life and now\nFind yourself surrounded by the darkness of that decision and feeling the pain I encourage you not to hide in the shadows where the double once you but instead to bring that to the one who loves you the most your lord and savior who seeks to save the center the last the broken\nThe one who's forgiveness knows no limits in seats to embrace you again in his love\nAmidst darkness storms in trials Jesus Says\nI Am with you always even to the end of the age and in that there is much to be thankful for the life giver our lord and savior ceased to give us life eternal in him he wants to share of his love that you would share his love with others also\nMay we always think of God's created children however they arrive in this world and wherever we find them in the age of this life\nIs full of value and purposes God declares us to be for the whole children are heritage from the lord the fruit of the room a reward\nMay we thank the lord always for valuing our lives enough to save them\nBut there is nothing greater to be thankful for today than a father who spared not even the life of his son just save ours and trusting in this most precious work of Christ we will arrive home again to share\nIn a life that never ends made that piece which passes all understanding keep your hearts and minds in your lord and savior Jesus\nChrist in his name we pray on men [noise]\nTo learn how you can support worldwide outreach of loose or an hour

and joining me as always and I say though is the last week he was out on the same I think there were you teaching in Texas I was teaching in Connecticut that's a long\nWays from Texas I I was on the right country\nBut they're not in the region but deliveries back with us today do you guys are with us last week we had John O'Donnell he's the chief now jobs are we calling the rain maker hear it on trade he got me\nFilling in for Larry's big shoes here on the income generating show now one of the things that we love to talk about here is we love to talk about making more money hence the name right we're all about income here it's all about driving more income now it always ends up being\nIncome for retirement or income for today right we can use the income for for really whatever we want but it's all about having more income so that we can do the things we want to do rather than do the things we have to do no inside of our financial markets one of the things that we stress a lot we spend a lotta time on this show\nIs how to make consistent income and that's that's one of the things I Love having Larry out here out here talking about he sheds a lot of light on that subject as far as how we can make consistent income in the market and it really starts with a consistent approach in an all we mean by consistent approach is the markets go up down in sideways so we've got to\nHave a strategy we've got to have an approach that can make money off the underside was right now we've got that Bush biased where some of the greatest consumers of all time but Larry what are some of the things you and your instructor team are really having a student's focus on right now to generate money and to be able to identify those down opportunities and they'll sideways opportunities well\nIt really comes out of the things that's about awareness and basically emotion right now so the awareness\nAnd by following people who are already doing what you want to do and well of course referring to the big banks and so a lot of what we teach our students is\nHow the banks make money and most of the ways they make money is not just by going long where most people learn a trade that way\nBut also by going what we call shorting the market and that simply means when the markets go down it's not necessarily a negative thing\nIt's an opportunity and so with self aware is understanding that there's more ways than what you might have been taught to trade and as a result you now simply learn which most people don't understand that their way to trade money in the markets is really simple it's a transfer money for people who don't know what they're doing to people who do know what they're doing\nHere's one one recent graduate had to say\nWell my training I had I mean as taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a better trader a better plan or I'm a better father\nLed online training academy help you pursue your financial goals so you could have more time to focus on what really matters\nThe kids are static because I'm I'm available now we can eat together as a family um I get my trading Diane and that they're happy\nAre you ready to start living the life you've dreamed of learn more visitors on line at oh gee a free tablet dot com that's OT a free tablet dot com\nWelcome back if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs and director of instructor development and top instructor it online trading means the brains of the operation here that's for sure he was shouldn't some light on how to make money at the markets are going up down or ...\nAnd generate more income and consistent income\nNo matter which way the market is going and whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading in investing in some of them are just looking to fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole a whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit of a multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying the last in the last segment you want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics\nAnd and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like well\nStarting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan\nWe're going to start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials because one of the biggest resolution says what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and this is something that a lot of students come in and out of the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in they don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do you've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example\nThis bank has only had what was it nine losing days in five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work\nAnd then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules so a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know it they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities\nWhat I've talked to students about the biggest concern is right now is what if we have another major correction where are they going to be able to make up that income and you know it's not a question anymore of if it's when we're already starting to see\nReminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven a Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people to not have a situation happened to them again like it did before\nAnd I don't think anybody out there is on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah you know that's not the it's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big New Year's resolutions be back in January on the show and it'll be fun to do another one this next January but one of the things that we we went through every recalls we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and and one of them was like I Hope I work like you were saying I Hope I work till the\nFor the day I die in ... and other ones where I Want a downgrade my lifestyle and and and and unfortunately those are those are reality is that the that a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small two weeks\nI I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture was about how little things become big things and so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income and what if it was five dollars a day right now at five dollars they could turn into ten dollars a day could turn it is\nFive dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point it goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like the ... and stuff like that where I I and I might miss this up so if I Do correct me with it on it but it is you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great right there there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say they're necessary for us to hear but then there are also\nNecessary for us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing in our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there is a step by step process to both of those\nAnd at the end of the year the reason why maybe we didn't make more money or we didn't lose weight the reason we didn't is staring back at us in the near ... and really we've got to own that we've got to say okay I'm not going to let anything be my optical and especially that person in the mirror is not going to be ... obstacle\nWhich just simply means usually changing similar habits and changing what we're doing is not a complete life overhaul but it's just adding a few more pieces and that can help it generates more income\nAnd I have to class really spend a lot of time going through some of these step by step process is that can help generate more income before you to see those you're going to need to you're going to need to have tickets so they'll let you in the one of the things we could do there if you're up for it as we give away somewhere ticket let's do it All right well right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area\nThat have take classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to start generating multiple streams of income\nIncome through stocks options futures currencies right multiple streams of income\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes the one of these classes so if you are driving now's the time to pull over and get that phone ready including with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors\nLessons on topics like how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now also think you get for attending a half day class online training academy is going to give you a Kindle Fire tablet\nSo you can access on training academy is educational information anytime you want colors tender twenty are going to receive to free passes to professional insiders gets one for you and one for a friend and when you attend you're going to receive that can do fire tablet\nKind of sensory twenty we need you to call now and reserve those seats the number is eight eight eight\nNine seven four eight seven to three as triple eight nine seven four eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at ... ... dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThe the multiple streams of income topic is one that I Love I Love how\nHow you can really approached the financial markets you really can't pick out commodities you could separate commodities you can separate options you can separate currencies you could separate separate a dividend strategy and very very quickly you could build out four to five six even seven different types different streams of income\nFrom the different financial markets that we have out there and we haven't even touched on real estate or owning another business or different things like that that can be passive as well\nRight here in the financial markets where all you really need is an Internet connection we have the opportunity or we have the the access of generating these multiple streams of what are some of the well some of the multiple streams what are some of the secondary streams of some of the passive type or types of income that you see a lot of the students focusing on that are really helping them reach their financial freedom\nWell before I jump into that let's take a look again about just getting a second job people think by simply adding some zeroes at the end of their income they're simply going to be out of debt where most of the time they don't get educated enough and they're adding more zeroes the end of their expenses\nSo one of the ways you could look at this as as you mentioned are students realize that they can be trading and this is really about them so even if you're listening it's about you what are your goals right now what are you trying to attain because a lot of times you'll sit back that puts you at a time machine like let's say we put them back in the delorean right back to the future oh yeah\nTwo years and you it's made some goals for yourself how many people actually go ahead and achieve those goals probably very few and two years from now what's gonna make it any different that something will change instead what if you could learn a skill that allows you to generate daily income weekly income monthly income\nAnd you don't have to spend extra hours doing it we have to call three hour traders they get up in the morning when the market opens and they want to be out of their trades within a couple of hours and they got their whole day to spend with their family their friends\nTaking vacations the key that I find is that it really is about like we've mentioned\nFreedom how are you going to find a way to ease your time to ally to do the things that you want and the biggest single obstacle that most people have that prevent them from becoming successful either financially or life\nIs fear and so we help our students kind of get past that by really breaking this down in a simple way where students can figure for the first time\nHow banks make money and more importantly how they can make money too yeah\nAnd really procrastination ends up being the largest nation in the in the world right procrastination putting things off of you you're touching on fear there and that's what made me think about procrastination procrastination is like the result of fear\nRight is what happens when we're afraid we just we just put it off all you know what I'm I'm fearful of this and I I Know that I Need to do it so internally we say I am going to do it just not today\nWhen really that just means we're not going to do it right so we're we're procrastinating we're putting it off and that helps kind of take some of the pressure off of fear but one of the things about pressure is that's how diamonds are created\nAnd it simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life and the the the the\nWay to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down\nIt's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high most of what's the probability of buying an all time high as as being you buy low opera opportunity right can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pulled back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for ah\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the Bush biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every payday the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds to their four one case\nAbout through their RSP through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that ... that the general practice kind of around the world is on payday would just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we are going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight a ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more as it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on his way up if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highs\nOffsets all the money that was invested in that four one K. back in two thousand nine or taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK right we just have to know that\nA Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client noticed I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got to kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as there he says okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area that have take classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement growing whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half the class has to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over including\nWith your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like enhancing retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional insider kept makes it so you get started right\nAlso is a thank you for attending and a half the class online training academy is going to give you a Kindle Fire tablet so you can access online training academy educational information anytime you want\nHow

end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ free tablet dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we've got a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that are told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you had the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what happened to retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your say retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you switch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income\nEnables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating money you need to retire the right way and again\nThis comes down to getting your cells educated\nWhat I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and you see right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from a Youtube video and then go up to fly school and go watch the Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense well the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother played portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhenever you whenever you bring up a the pursuit of happiness and you say to covering coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Keely would always say over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal\nAnd over I've heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from that will give credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just wanted elaborate on before we jump into this break is as you were talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article that I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spends three years of their life\nPaying for the fees so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you can expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees is really take control of your of your money but before you should do that you need to know how to do it well great place to start that just start that educational process is out of one of our half the class\nAre you ready I'm ready All right well right now we've got to have their class coming up in your area and a half the class as we can see exactly what it takes really take control those retirement generate that income for today and make sure that you have that income for tomorrow and it just a second

to you\nWell it's great to have you with us now let's talk to them this was very ... nominate on those people out there who just vaguely familiar with the story what exactly is ... ... why is it all over the news today\nWell first of all it sure is all over the news especially the Health News\nYou know I read about twenty health journals or weekend every one of them seems to have an article about resveratrol basically resveratrol is what we call a poly feed all it's found in red wine it's found in purple grape juice it's found in berries founded\nAnd the interesting thing about resveratrol is it's actually produced by plants\nBike Lance themselves to protect them\nAny kind of injury any kind of infection and against any kind of radiation and the scientists really first became interested in resveratrol mark about Nineteen Ninety two when ... was first isolated from red wine it was also found at that point in the skin of grapes as well\nAnd this is what got all those scientists interest in the early studies showed that resveratrol seemed to extend the life of fruit flies of worms and even some fish\nWell anything that extends the life of anything is going to pick the attention of scientists\nAbsolutely wow well by two thousand\nSix Italian scientist discovered that resveratrol extend the life of certain fish by fifty six percent and an even increased their swimming ability well also in two thousand six and here's what really got them interested\nA Harvard researcher David Sinclair reported\nThat resveratrol counter acted the negative effect of a high fat diet in mice bite thirty percent\nNow given that most Americans seem to be on a high fat diet\nThis was pretty darn interesting well later research goes on to show that resveratrol had a very positive effect on a number of interesting things like blood sugar levels like normal cell growth and it even seem to protect the intestines and the colon it definitely supported normal ... activity in the body it improved indoor ends there\nWas even a great study at the Institute of genetics and cell biology in France that showed that it dramatically improved enduring storing aerobic activity\nAnd an even proved to support brain function great study from Weill Cornell Medical school in New York I was just reading that an even neutralizes free radicals but the reason the bottom line reason mark that it's all over the news nowadays is research at Harvard\nThey found that caloric restriction eating less actually slows the pace of aging and extended the lifespan in laboratory animals by forty percent\nWell whenever our health is threatened any perceived health threat like not eating enough\nCaloric restriction your body feels threatened this which is on what they called the longevity gene in your body it switches on sort of a protective mechanism that begins on a cellular level metabolism changes\nYour ability to adapt and cope dramatically changes as a major positive influence on growth hormones and stress hormones there's actually an increase in repair all of this which Don by a family of genes we called sirtuin but here's the key\nAccording to the work done by David Sinclair at Harvard no this is important\nThe most potent activate or of the sirtuin genes in addition to caloric restriction is resveratrol and a great hope is that what's happening and all these animal studies all these amazing benefits with resveratrol will translate into people as well\nAnd this is why millions of people all over the world are now taking resveratrol pretty much every day\nWell let me just a back room over the new ... products for several years under ... news but now the teacher who ends aren't you would use is just as important as was near its role especially for your heart healthy and uses in some ways it's got more evidence so let me ask you this who needs and what is that these are good for\nWell first of all let's take a quick peek a what a co enzyme is\nA co enzyme has any substance in the body that speeds up the rate at which a chemical reaction takes place it's like a vitamin in many respects\nWell it's very interesting it combined some really amazing nutrients specifically co enzyme Q. ten and resveratrol\nAnd a number of other nutrients we'll talk about later that support your health and energy and that's the bottom line\nYou're looking at what we call the advantage of combining of very nutrient that creates your body's energy co Q. ten with the benefits of resveratrol\nThe energy stamina that comes with it and it's an unbeatable combination that gives you this advantage as cardiovascular system benefit\nBenefits to your brain cognitive performance you scan aerobic capacity it supports normal and some magic activity throughout the body it's just an amazing combination and that's why we call it the advantage\nThat depressed than you know I Love the fact that in the new coke hubris very ... super formula from purity products you combined the co Q. ten with was Vera troll\nNow there was very close to ... molecule found in red wine which they're studying at Harvard and I know that it activates genes are those are just to to talk to us about all the excitement surrounding ... and why you specifically wanted him this formula\nWhile I tell you the researchers at Harvard under the leadership of Dr David Sinclair this is what they found\nCaloric restriction eating less slows the pace of aging that's pretty darn impressive and what they found in the laboratory studies of animals is that an extended lifespan and it appeared that caloric restriction eating less food and you're eating right now by a certain percentage increases your longevity your list\nHe says the activity of what we call a longevity gene they get switched on day help improve metabolism it increases your ability to cope your ability to adapt in fact this gene helps increased tissue repair and its switched on by a group of genes called sirtuin now they found two things at Harvard number one\nCaloric restriction increases these longevity genes the sirtuin\nWell so does resveratrol\nAt least in their animal studies and this is exactly ...
