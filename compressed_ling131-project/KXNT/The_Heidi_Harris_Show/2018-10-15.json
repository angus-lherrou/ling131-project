joining us this morning just Monday morning\nJoe on money just was CBS News business was was a way to start with you know terrible if you go back to San city\nThink about among gun reward all of the stores that are that we remember from growing up and now see years of all companies\n[noise] yeah and what's awfully sad about it is it's sort of feels like it didn't need to happen\nOn so you know here's what you got to think about this is a company that has had a series of rolling problems over almost four decades and I could almost trace this back to the mid eighties when I Know it's hard to believe and I was six years old and you know a traitor on Wall street\nJust getting on but when I was early in my career I absolutely remember\nOne of the big changes with Sears was that it decided it was going to actually become a financial company and it bought dean Witter rentals in the eighties it was going to literally be go from socks to stocks it I mean it was his hair Martin everyone thought that was a crazy idea but\nHere said no we've got all this money where I kind of we if we can do whatever we want and it is true they could accept while they were trying to build a financial company that they bought dean Witter they bought Caldwell banker they started discover\nCard a funny thing happened they took it off the ball and competitors like Wal Mart's specifically we're starting to really eat into the Sears business and I don't think Sears took that very seriously at first by Nineteen Ninety One Wal Mart had overtaken Sears as the largest us retailer and I think\nThat was sort of the first phase where we see something really bad happening in the second phase it's simply that\nThe company doesn't react quickly enough that doesn't react to consumer habits that people really love this idea of discount it didn't react to the fact that\nSuburban malls we're starting to decline or that online retailing was really going to be a thing and so it missed like another opportunity in the eighties and sorry in the nineties and then the early to thousands and then finally Mitt to thousands\nThey allowed a guy who was a hedge fund dude to come in and say oh all you need is financial engineering that's all you need and that was certainly not the case the company became saddled with debt they never invested in the company itself instead they bought back shares and lined the pockets of the investors\nWhile the company was literally withering away you\nKnow that reminds me when you talked about a hedge fund it reminds me when CBS was taken over back and I

four Michael Castle with you\nOn wake up was rex talk a forty ... accent [noise] going to take your Eglin air force base in Florida\nThe United states touching down an air force one any time now\nWe're joined by Westwood One correspondent ... ... this is so important for president to do but I I gotta say out of anything I've seen I don't think the president has any president has seen the devastation that this president is about to witness\nThough I think you're absolutely right I think that the damage is so widespread that it is just catastrophic it it really is unlike anything that we've seen before because of the extent of the damage that has been caused from Panama City\nAll the way down to Mexico beach in places inland do you cannot drive anywhere in that greater area without seeing how relying street down churches with groups ripped off\nThis is something that happened to five days ago and there are still people without food and water that can't get out of their homes because there's trees in front of the doorway\nNo the president is going to arrive at Eglin which is just outside of the dust in Fort Walton Beach airport I'm going to assume he'll uh tickets were by way of marine ones you see marine one there\n[noise] you know I haven't seen it yet but I think that's really the only feasible way to do that\nSleeping on a mattress outside of a hotel in Callaway, Florida that's where he wrote the storm out he said he is very bad or right is it hadn't been able to reach any type of shelter he said that if it wasn't for a good Samaritan that brought a boxer food he doesn't know what he would have done\nWell I think it is important for the president to get in there I mean it it's kinda hard to when you take a look at Mexico beach itself\nOr I guess everything is pretty well flattened there at this point I Hope the president is able to get in there and and hear their stories and and quite frankly\nYou know having been having covered the sings myself there's just something about the president of United States being there and just hearing what you're going through and seeing what you're going through sometimes you just need that\n[noise] yeah and I think these people definitely need something at this point uh you know they've been very frustrated over the last few days I've seen tensions really start to rise in one moment and then the next moment you'll see a group of people hugging each other on the side of the road it's a roller coaster of emotions for sure of the people here\nAnd uh that no matter what their political opinion is I think seeing some type of recognition from the president of the United states really can't go a long way because what people need right now it's some sort of hope\nWe're talking with Clinton never Westwood One correspondent who is at Eglin air force base when when do we expect the president to be landing do you know\nUh yeah within a that the uh thirty minutes ten twenty five central is when he's expected to land\nI'm just going to keep you on the phone and then just have your hand the phone to him 'cause I I've got a few questions for a ... what how long do we expect him to be a a I'd say on the ground but in Florida looking around we know a couple of hours\n... hours yeah I think he's headed to Georgia and the two o'clock hour at least some of the damage there so he's getting bored and Georgia both today\nYou have any estimates yet even rough estimates on damage at this point in the on the panhandle\nDie it's billions of dollars a the numbers are still being thrown out there but I'm telling you that the entire infrastructure of Mexico beach is just destroyed and there are not many businesses in Panama City that survived in fact I think it's safe to say after being there for a few days there are no business\nThat when unscathed from this storm there are several that are starting to open now but the restaurants that are starting to open now are just opening with like grills in front of the front door you know the ruins of hamburgers and hot dogs\nOf my friends and family Toyota traffic center accident south found on the Ninety five before Charleston and other north down on
