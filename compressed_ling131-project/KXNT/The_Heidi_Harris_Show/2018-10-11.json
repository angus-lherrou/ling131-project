devastation and you want to talk about a ... a correspondent who never gives up CBS News correspondent Rob Milford is under a cell tower one that you found finally to get some sell\nA reception uh it it looks awful absolutely awful in Panama City right now\nThe ... very thing I've ever seen now but all the weather\n\nAnd lo and man and one of the things that we that I I just heard as well a from a meteorologist was inside that I Am a hundred and fifty five right up you know getting right on the edge of a cat five you also had vortex inside a like like tornado activity up to two hundred miles an hour\nYeah yeah absolutely and if you look at that scale it talks about how the wind velocity of different tornadoes works or the wall was in the neighborhood of an effort to or an F. three tornado the differences when the tornado comes over there and go on in a minute\nThese were five ten Fifteen minutes\nAs the eye wall moved over you and around you it's not an instantaneous snap your fingers and as a slow moving Thirteen Fifteen miles an hour forward last city it takes a while that's why in in different parts of the area\nI've seen trees that are knocked down from west facing east north facing Sal\nRusso scale off in both directions a man I met one church was just completely one\nOf those prefab steel buildings high big open a area and it just rip the roof and ripped the sides right off of sequels fine they will probably have church there this Sunday just because they could but the rest of it is just shredded\nCould lead sounds like it was just like peeled open like a like a sardine can when you take a look around a we know we know that there are\nA two deaths at this point in a reminder we're talking with CBS News correspondent Rob Milford in Panama City Florida we know there are two deaths that are reported from what you are seeing around you it's early uh do you have any information on injuries or fatalities\nThose are the only two fatalities yeah you say what you will you want to believe in miracles that great a lot of people got real lucky if there is one sparsely populated area of the Florida Gulf Coast this was it just behind or shall we say north of Panama City and to the east it's\nAbout I don't know how many hundred thousand acres of nothing but pine trees these are these are\nApplying plantations they grow the the wood that turns into the paper you're writing honor the stuff on a role in the bathroom that's the ... of the area\nAnd we're lucky the trees can take the hit and not a densely populated area a uh uh Pensacola Fort Walton Biloxi Gulfport weather a lot of people living right up against the coast this they were lucky in that respect number to everyone has paid attention when they said get out there going okay we're leaving they grab their stuff and they go\nAnd you know for a storm of this magnitude this severity\nOr to lose one guy and he was in his house away from the ocean in a tree fell on his house\nAnd that's just it could have been in another room and you go wow my lucky it was it was just in time and the little girl in Georgia I don't know the details on sort of focus down here on the Gulf yeah but for two people that die a direct result of the storm it's miraculous that that's all you can say\nAnd especially if you're taking a look at a hurricane that's bad enough but when you take a look at possibly say up to possibly for a e to or east read a ... tornado or or or Texas\nInside moving slow I mean usually get desk with tornadoes alone so it it literally at this point you really do have to say it's a miracle and you know what here's the deal you can't rebuild your little girl you can't rebuild grandpa there\nIt is is absolutely awful you can rebuild buildings though and there is going to be a lot of rebuilding I I'm from what I Am seeing eye Rob I have no idea how long it's going to take to to rebuild Panama City alone taking a look at Mexico beaches well\nMexico beach quaint little fishing village or saint Joe was actually the port where they ship all of the all of the pine trees from they caught him they put them on a truck they take and they put them on a barge\nThey go all over the world of port saint Joe Mexico beach it's like somebody just took a chainsaw went through the whole joined\nI mean it's yeah it's really sad but Panama City spring break capital of the eastern United States for many many years and\nA lot of it is still stand a lot of it really is the closer you moved to downtown the greater the damage that you see I was I was down there and went oh my gosh I've got to talk to Las Vegas I had to run out and find themselves cell tower that work\nThe point being utility crews are pouring in like the like the first Armored Division man they're
