Bush\nWhen he was in office\nAre talking about a pathway to citizenship and it sent a GOP into a tailspin\nThey were melting down over this now we have a brand new caravan\nHis when it's being called about five thousand or so from what we understand coming up from Honduras with sticky United Nations and CBS News Warner fears animals Pamela fuck we very clearly have a a a problem when you have a country or several countries that have such violence\nThat they are willing to do anything very dangerous to go make this journey to the United states especially going through Mexico yet it exists in in yet we're seeing you know the chairman\nYes exactly and this time or the president has upped the ante a bit by saying the U.S military will go down that's because the Mexican government sent to seven twenty seven Boeing planes\nFilled with federal police officers to the southern border with Guatemala to intercept the caravan they're being pressed by both Honduras Guatemala or to try to I mean they the Mexicans to try to figure out how to tap\nOn the border and try to close it from\nJust transiting through Mexico to the United states and that's because there are a lot of things going on with the U.S and Mexico and they're all good in terms of trade and Mexican population is really\nA the migrant population is going down significantly so it's really an issue as you said of Guatemala and Honduras now one last point because cats are we know each other\nFor so long well you show me your ankles so we're close\nI remember that George W. Bush era because\nI was in Mexico at the time when they sent the Fox and George W. Bush to New Mexico better than any president as a former Texas\nGovernor and they almost had a massive migration reform going through immigration reform going through and it had all the the key players in the Senate on board and it's always tough but they had it and then nine eleven came in it it it hasn't been dealt with it and\nAnd that was one of his that's one of the things that he\nAnd it's always tough but they had it and then nine eleven came and it it hasn't been dealt with it and\nAnd that was one of his that's one of the things that he wanted to accomplish yeah it was his presidency and it kicked off the G O P\nBut George W. Bush museums in political here but he was a president who is willing to to step aside from party in ... people in his own party just like Bill Clinton was willing to do to to get something actually accomplished\nRight and he had leaders in the Senate at that time Phil Gramm and Ted Kennedy and all these people Republican and Democrat\nComing on board to try to figure out a bipartisan compromise any really I ... it was so close you could smell it at that time and it all fell apart and we haven't dealt with it as a country since\nAnd that's the problem I mean what's happening is no country wants an open border it's just we used to when I was working in the hell we used to call him oh T.

an event for Dean Heller like in ... you're not going to be with him tomorrow but you've been with them before this guy says some some stuff that is wrong sometimes just absolutely wrong I I have\nA disagreed with you on that we have that on the air before yeah\nI I'm not going to defend his rhetoric and some of the any of the things that he is said and I we we both have agreed to that part I I I'm concerned about the direction our country was going for so many years I see us going in a\nIn a positive direction at least with the economy and and what we're doing what some of the fighting back against North Korea and Iran and from the other things that I really am happy with the direction the country goes President Trump's a different person has ever been in the White House I most people never thought somebody could\nBe in this position with the way he talks in his rhetoric but uh maybe our country is so divided in so upset at the time that um that it's allowed President Trump to get in there but I mean what he's doing policy wise you can't argue with the success a and that we can if we have ten minutes I could list all the\nDifferent things that the economy if you don't have to 'cause he'll do it for us you know I remember back in the day when my parents were upset about the uh\nThe golf cleats holes that were left by President Eisenhower in the oval office I mean this guy's a whole different level uh Danny Tarkanian he is congressional candidate for Nevada's third ah I don't challenge the other candidates to come on this show I said to you what are you afraid of that is my message this morning\nYou know I as I said if as soon as he would like to come on the air and and both of us answer questions for me I don't know to do so it's the way the listeners can really hear first hand what each candidate believes in\nThe other thing too about you know this sounds like and blowing smoke but you and I just had a chance to talk more you're not going to be screaming and yelling over your not nuts or you're somebody who actually can have a conversation about policy I think it'd be terrific so if we can get a debate on the air with human Suzie we were ready to rock and

about um that this mid range a version of of the model three coughing thirty five thousand\nFederal rebate or that the talk of the clock is ticking on that if you will uh so you have to take delivery of a Tesla before the end of the year to to receive that four Seventy five hundred and this is because the government put in place a rule ... years ago\nUh for a company only be eligible for that full rebate for the first two hundred thousand sales than once once they cross that threshold\nThere is a little bit of a grace period where the following two quarters or the ... the company can continue to get the that tax credit for their buyers are but those two quarters or ... or end on December thirty first for ...\nYou know I got to tell you something Greg I'm looking at a sweet and it kind of is like when you're trying to convince your mom that it was a really good idea for all the money for whatever it was that you want it's constantly five K. after federal and state rebates in California but true cost of ownership\nIs really closer to thirty one thousand empty your gas savings see it's really worth it see I mean\nIt's very ... very few Muskie yes and and\nIran are done in this uh a lot over the years he's he's kind of you know tried to you know use every which way to sort of uh bringing down the cost of the vehicle with all these other factors so that part is nothing new but certainly what's what's going on here too is is just a a\nAn attempt by the company to get closer to that thirty five thousand a range but without a you know sort of making rash moves toward that and it's important for the company or to to continue to sell as many of the higher end versions of the cars to possibly can\nTo to have money coming in the door and to be able to ah you know to to sort of
