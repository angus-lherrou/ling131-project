the devil is at and where we are at in relation to God and to all the forces which arise to deceive into trouble lost the great God sent his son Jesus Christ into the work\nHe really came the story is

of God combined with love of God with that kind of personality you can draw close to God as he has drawn close to you\nYou're perfectly content to go along with God with faith and fear and a lot of producing a new maturity without really healthy outlook on life that's what Martin Luther was talking about when he explained the ten commandments we should fear and love and trust in God above all things\nWe should fear and love God that we may tame our cursing and swearing and crabbing and sharp and filthy times we should fear and love God that we may offer him acceptable worship and

every time\nAnd when I Would uh when I Would wake up from this dream I'd be like really startled and in in my heart would be racing and I'd be half awake and half asleep and I would see\nYou know shadows in the room is a little kid you know and that's scary stuff it was that I had a closet that didn't have a door\nSo dark um and I had a a Barney Rubble nightly stone yeah I had like night light and that was the only light in the room and sometimes it helped and sometimes that cast odd you know shadows and all but ...\nWhat happened is I was going through this period of when I went to sleep I

first time listening or that we are you my name is Ryan said have you with us today joining me as always my great friend directly restructure the structure dominant tree is everyone wants to be like and that is because\nHe is the brains of the operation out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how they're doing doing great Ryan how you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun doing the show and talking to your financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time and I would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to\nHow to generate more income inside of the financial markets and one of the things we always stress and I I Know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the marks going down whether the mark throwing sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and it's individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold kind of bullish mentality of you know we we invest\nSir viewed as well so bad 'cause people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith right now is what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the source of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on with the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now to help people become more consistent and less directional independent instead of the market\nWill this last week it's been beautiful I mean everything we've been talking about on the show together I'm Talking about this for weeks now waiting for the opportunity to see the markets correct and come back down and as a result what happens starting off at the end of last week into this week as we got everybody's wish that the market started coming down it comes down three times faster than it goes up\nIn the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approached\nTo make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down and also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time\nTalking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you're talking about a few minutes ago and and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys worked with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is the primary source of income is a great\nQuestion Ryan you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy\nThinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for his freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over four hundred and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to the point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the half day classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward and really specifically when you ... back to the half day class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by X percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about that's really kind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was\nThe freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with ... with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month and that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts\nWhere you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be through options that could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say there is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire and he has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nWe're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy as little time but it ends up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in that rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nAt it you know as you're thinking what you're saying and you\nKnow most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing\nWhich really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the fraud if you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you cover the box a couple of times the frog hits the top lid and he just that little way they still can't jumping the higher the way the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or different definition of a self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd now not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom in doing the things we wanted to rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he said let's do it right now we have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that's supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half their classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great were warning that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets\nWell in just a second you're gonna have a

at ... ... dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income which kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start people\nOff with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and with ... once said as you\nDon't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great so many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly well not not at all in fact most of our instructors will tell our students is I\nAbout quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love because if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right we don't want to do that because we are looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard this expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart\nWell that's not how people who make a lot of money I think\nThey're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent no\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love\nAnd said about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you make it a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income but if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nHe's going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder we're teaching students how to work\nRight and that simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself\nAnd hopefully people are listening right now and see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money ran out of the gates and just you know I Want to I Want to take this dollar entered into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay it's not very realistic right but so one of the things we always like to bring that up as it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness and any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to have first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a big get rich quick program\nThen have to cost probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in directly and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts\nSo again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage that got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to a teacher a student's right out of the gate that they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement\nYou can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nAnd you're talking about the kind of the cycles of the markets go through the big up from the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at um how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so it kind of that average that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you had about a fifty percent drop Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early two thousand fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kinda what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal but the thing that I went through with my father about a year we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and they lost fifty thousand they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take an average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web that's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty\nTo take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we were talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nOne of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan they don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit and then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash\nIt could've been one of the greatest kind of your life right now it's a little bit at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all and the correction\nOne of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get them out to one of the half day classes you ready for a little give away let's do it

two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you're talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being an all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat my dentist offices the kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and nothing against that poor people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs\nAnd so think about it you're at an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you invest in your money and all of a sudden the market corrects will that correction is going to impact\nThe first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that ... percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediately at sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture isn't housing dividend cuts devastating cuts are all these things have a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and say this won't happen to me\nThere's a huge risk out there and that and a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started\nEnded his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get them out to one of the half day classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to

R. E. E. offer I said free offered today from purity products no strings attached\nThis is a free offer from a reputable company that's been in business for years just you need the phone number as soon as we tell you more about ha\nNow you see there's a youth molecule in the human body and then it holds the key to visible signs of age you know you've written about this you've traveled to Japan to do the research so so tell me about what is that we use this molecule you're talking about had\nIt's amazing that most people don't know this word ... acid and of course it's made it's all over our body it's in our skin it's an all natural molecule we can get it orally replace it in our body\nBut more so we've learned that the little bit that we can get as a dietary supplement can trigger your body to make more\nAnd of course why do we need more well when we're young we're loaded with this stuff when we're babies we have what we call baby fat it's really baby H ... it it makes a well as babies fall down and get cuts and scrapes you notice\nThey never really get any lifelong scars from that because they have lots of H. A. on board highly ironic gas it and to make this easy to understand for the audience I think we can all appreciate\nThat women have smooth their skin and thicker hair and so on all of that is because estrogen sends a signal to make more ha and that's why the girls have more limber flexible joints they can get in a kind of a load of posture kind of the men can't get into they\nThey certainly have all of those advantages and it's because the estrogen sends a signal\nTo make more ha now women have more ha to lose the men do and you see the skin shoveling up the joints and so on as women age but there is a way to get it back and of course purity products for years now has been talking\nAbout ha and they have a new formula just for the joints H A joint formula and it's so important today because\nI think everyone's confused an article in the New York times says consumers are confused what to do to support their joints took people are looking for alternatives we need cushioning in between the joints the bones in our joints when a doctor looks at an X ray\nAll he's doing is measuring the space between the two bones there in the knees so it's about a quarter of an air and space without that cushioning you've got bone rubbing on bone\nThat's what age eight is it's the jello or the cushioning agent in between our bones\nWe lose it either due to wear and tear or age and so we start getting problems the more that we find pain relief\nThe more pain relievers we use\nThe more we're going to use these joints and then we're going to wear out more bone and they've noticed this people who chronically used pain relievers\nAre going to have more bone where so what you need is the actual cushioning back there to lubricate the joint and that's what ha does that's what ha is that doctors call it ... fluid\nThey actually inject this into joints orthopedist do dermatologist injected into the skin I doctors use it as a lubricant during eye surgery so it's nothing foreign to modern medicine but it may be new to you as a listener there and you ...\nHa before well you need to learn about it it's a wonderful molecule it's all natural and you can get it as a dietary supplement purity products was the first to introduce it now it's a great big long molecule path that six million Dalton's and molecular weight think of\nAnd of course ah he works about six to eight hours out in the fields every day this was remarkable I almost felt at I was in some sort of a place where the dinosaurs are still living or something that was so remarkable\nThese people just exhibit a youthful this a\nA flexibility in their joints\nCertainly helpful mess that we just don't see everywhere else in fact it was so remarkable that the emperor of Japan actually has visited this village pictures were taken there you could see them all over the village there as they had posted them so this had stood out and of course Connie Chung or ABC News twenty twenty had gone to visit there\nIn the year two thousand this was originally on television you could see the actual pictures for yourself\nBut the ha revolution has come here pat and of course we've had three years of use of ha but we could lose people in the science so they want to know what's real is this for\nSo for Tom who writes to us a pharmacist now from Santa Cruz California Seventy years of age participating in the whole lie Iron Man contest and Kona, Hawaii this past year\nSeventy years old he said this new ha formula for the joints did a great job not certainly a pharmacist with no here's John writing to me and saying you know at age fifty five boy when I tried ha I'm now back to playing\nFull court basketball with the twenty year old and I've even begun to jog again these are the kinds of reports that we here\nLet me ask you a question here you mentioned the glucose and mean and there's another one up and it's pretty popular MSN how does this ... stack up against those other ones the other ones you have to take them for a while before you even see any results shoe and\nMost of these are very positive dietary supplements they certainly have\nLots of benefits glue costs may take quite a while to kick in\nMSN is a wonderful sulfur compounds and again it's an anti inflammatory as are many things like fish oil ... these are all wonderful\nBut they're not dealing with the origin of the problem the origin of the problem is the loss of cushioning and the joy and if we can just replaced is if we can find a way to get that cushioning back\nThat's what we call usefulness that's what we had when we were young here's David writing to me from New York twenty five years looking for something that would help support\nHis lower back and of course he said I Can't believe it now he says I Can't thank you enough for this product people have tried all the alternatives they've searched everywhere else pat and they haven't heard of highly ironic as of\nNow the reorder reads on AJ sort of tell me
