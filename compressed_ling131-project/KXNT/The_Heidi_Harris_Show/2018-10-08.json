got Oregon running like a Dollar General litter nation and the ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n\n\nYes the forties you Michael Johnson or this is wake up Las Vegas\nDo\nHave an update on or maybe the first time you're hearing about it I just heard about this morning when my uh my friends were texting me saying like you know don't wipe out\nFlorida Michael I'm like what do you ... oh yeah yeah yeah there's a hurricane Michael is now a category one hurricane with a maximum sustained winds Seventy five miles per hour I'm worse if I don't have coffee\nNational Hurricane center latest advisory has Michael located about fifty miles off the western tip of Cuba's storm is moving to the north it seven miles an hour could make landfall as a category ... storm on Wednesday along the Florida Gulf Coast\nAnd the way it's looking is that it would whip across the panhandle and then up along the east coast so they could get a\n... a woman from Michael\nDumped ticked me off that's all I'm saying let's take you to Texas now was to run a corresponding Clayton level is joining a Texas judge's appointment attorney for a nine year old north Texas girl whose parents are fighting to keep up\nIt's much about her condition we do know though that they say that there is no saving her and that you brain dead in the best option is for them to take her off of life support that's what the hospitals that hospital also says\nThat typically parents are under the assumption when they come to ... children that they are to trust the hospital and in this particular case the parents are saying no they went and got a court order to stop the hospital from taking a nine year old off of life support\nAnd the most recent news out of this ongoing battle is a judge on friday that that a third party attorney must come in and represent the nine year old a Peyton summons herself that it can't just be the parents against the hospital there needs to be a third party that come in\nAnd think about the best interest of the child so that third party attorney will be at the first hearing since she was brought on board on when that\nWell Clinton I think the first of all anytime you're talking about parents in and their little when they're little nine year old I mean you're going to be in denial you're not going to want that trial to go and\nNo matter what I mean if you find yourself in the situation you you think you might be able to say well what I Would do you don't know unless you've been in this situation very clearly but\nYou know at the same time taking away any control that they have\nOver this child is just absolutely heartbreaking how long do we know how long this kid has been on life support\n[noise] well yeah we know that she's been on for just over a week and that she will be on according to the last court order\nFor fourteen days from them from one that was about a week and a half left as far as back or order goes now like could be extended that's what the parents are fighting to do but at the judge last friday did give her a week or two more days\nTo remain on life support and so that's really the big question is can the hospital you this\nThe hospitals says look we we hate this we did our breath\nBut there's no way for her to recover she had a cardiac arrest she has cancer and a brain tumor and there's just no coming back from this and the parents are saying it's not up to you to decide if our daughter goes off of life supporter dot in the hospital says well you know what she's under our care it is our decision and so now it's up to a judge\nI I think we're talking with the novel a whistle ruined correspondent in ah in Dallas was it a shovel and trying to remember the ... the case where ...\nWhere you know Congress actually got involved for one individual which they rarely rarely do but it seemed to be getting down to the same issue and that is whether it's a child or whether it's an adult there's any brain activity and any expectation that this person could ever live any kind of life other than a vegetative state [noise]\nYeah and so that's what this is going to come down to again there have been several court orders a lot of them have been a court hearings rather a lot of them have been for a living area and now that we know this third party attorney is going to come in on Wednesday we're going to start getting into issues like\nExactly what state is she in exactly how much hope she have\nBut a lot of people are saying you know what none of that really matters at the difference between a parent making the decision\nAnd hospital a lot of people out of argued about this that it doesn't matter what condition she's in the hospital says well you know what it really does because of a family just is refusing or to give up hope then at some point we've got to draw the line\nAnd they've decided seven days is the line and start\nAnd that's where the parents are really complaining here is you know they haven't said that they'll never give up hope and of course they've acknowledged how ... things look for her but they say we still\nAnd we don't want you to be the one to determine when we're supposed to stop\nWell that's understandable they'd been with her nine years and you know they're thinking you've only given a seven days let's let's try and figure out what more we can do thanks so much ... joining us\nFrom my Westwood One in Dallas thanks for being with us saying what a what a horrible thing to to have to go through there is a reality that does have to set in and it depends on what your doctors tell you and if you've been in a situation before no matter how much especially actually I should say especially if you love the person\nOr my dad had a massive stroke and would not have lived in I mean he was he was on life support and there was nothing there\nAnd you have to accept the fact that you that that person is gone they're no longer there and whether it happens to be somebody my dad was Seventy five\nA or happens to be a nine year old you have to listen to the the very best that the doctors tell you and they showed me brain scans and explained what was going on and it absolutely made sense wasn't something I was happy to do\nIt's it's coming up on ten years in a couple of weeks that I had to make that call myself\nIt's it's tough to do but you also have to face the reality\nAnd also sit and think about the fact that whether it's a child or whether it's your parent is is what they would want is this what you should be doing for them is this the best you can do for them because it can't be about you it has to be", "show_name": "The Heidi Harris Show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "08"}
