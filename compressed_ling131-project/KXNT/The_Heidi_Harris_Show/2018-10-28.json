control hearing about tragedies and perils near and far\nCan cause us to worry about how things will turn out and while there is solace in accepting things we cannot control we also need to feel that there are some things we can control\nThat we determine at least to some degree the direction of our lives and unknown author wrote\nThe greatest battle of life is fought out within the silent chambers of the soul\nA victory on the inside of a person's heart is worth a hundred conquests on the battlefields of life to be master of yourself is the best guarantee that you will be master of the situation knows I self\nThe crown of character is self control\nIn the end self control\nIs the only real control in life efforts to control others or even to control our circumstances usually don't succeed but we can become the master of ourselves\nWe begin by controlling our thoughts than our words and ultimately our actions we gain more self control when we'd daily strive to choose good in that same kind of hard hitting us to be honest and trustworthy to care for our mind body and soul\nOur self control deep and as we set worthy goals and achieve them as we make promises and keeps them and as we simply do our best to live with integrity this driving for self control is rightly called apple\nFor we all have tendencies we must fight to overcome but those tendencies don't represent our real selves as we begin to take control of our lives we come to understand who we truly are\nWe find that our true identity has less to do with the mistakes we've made in the past and more to do with our potential for future growth we aren't defined as so much by where we've ban as by where we are going\nThere are many battles that need fighting in this world many wrongs to be righted many changes to be made but to win any of them we must first when the greatest battle of life\nThe battle most worth fighting the battle for self control [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut not merely like a designer\nAnd author does more than design for example my smartphone had a designer but that person hasn't touched this machine a long long time if ever the majority of of this creations lifespan is spent far removed from its design or not so with an author\nAs long as the stories being told the author never leaves the authors continuously present in with and under all the characters settings in terms of plot\nAnd author is a creator but not in the same way that a mother and father are creators of father begets and a mother gives birth to their child right away the parents begin to interact with the child is a fellow person who's like them in every way\nOnly smaller mom and dad smile baby smiles back they ask questions soon she answers there's give and take a two way relationship\nIn contrast the author character relationship only goes one way the author exist on an entirely different level\nFor example Harry Potter Ronald we usually her money Granger they don't have access to JK Rowling they're not even real in the same way that J.K rally in Israel\nThere author makes them what they are characters can't give anything to the author that their author hasn't already given them first it's a one way relationship here saw the Bible says it who has known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor\nThey should ship here's how the Bible says it who\nHas known the mind of the lord or who has been his counselor or was given a gift to God that God should repay him for from him and threw him meant to him are all things to him be the glory into the age of the ages\nRomans eleven thirty four thirty six here's how job set it in God's hands is the life\nOf every living thing in the breath of all mankind\nIf God tears down non can rebuild if God shuts demand in non can open\nIf gosh you gather to himself his spirit and his breath all flesh would perish together in men would return to\nDust job twelve and thirty four job's belief that\nGot is the author of all things is the foreign at the throbbing source of his anguish if we continue reading the perplexing book that bears his name we here and go on to say God has torn me in his wrath\nGod gives me up to the ungodly cast me into the hands of the wicked\nWhy do the which it live and prosper why are not tons of justice kept by the almighty\nJob sixteen Twenty one and twenty four imagined being trapped in a story like that\nAt a turning point in the story of Harold Crick again he hears his author alluding to his past\nInterpreting his president foreshadowing his future Tyne is tied here's the voice again it was remarkable\nHow the simple modest elements of heroin life so often taken for granted would become the catalyst for an entirely new life\nBy the end of day\nHarold had enough again he hears that voice in his head\nHarold suddenly found himself beleaguered end exasperated outside the bakery\nShut up cursing the heavens in futility no I'm not a person you you stupid boy so shut up and leave me alone\nAnd even if you want it out you couldn't escape\nYou can't stop being a character in your author's story that doesn't stop you from trying\nYou rebel against your author now that you realize you fear that he's in with under everything messing with you you try to fight him resisting the movement of the story trends pressing the boundaries of you're setting but the more you struggled the more you only hurt yourself the more you fight him the more you find yourself fighting everyone around you\nSo you begin to resent your author you hate him\nOne day you try something new to protect yourself you start to tell a different tail it goes like this there is no author the universe is a an accident of on guided evolution\nFrom the idea of an omnipotent author is a infant tile illusion from an age without smartphones\nI must make my own meaning I must create my own the happy ending\nI Am the author of my story it's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living\nAnd so it goes you know that when\nIt's up to me to justify my life as a life worth living\nAnd so it goes you know that when we reject God the problem of justifying life in the face of evil and suffering doesn't go away it gets worse now you\nAnd I have to bear the God awful burden of justifying ourselves justifying our actions justifying our world or else we pass the buck onto a government and that will become our author and master\nQuestion of justification is on a void of all we cannot find meaning in life unless you receive it as a story and there's no story without an author and so the problem is always the same which author or do we trust\nNow Harold is standing at the bus stop and once more that voice provokes him\nAnd so on this particular Wednesday evening as heroin waited for the bus his watch suddenly stopped the U.S\nHarold watched trust him into the mythical path of fade little did he know that this simple seemingly innocuous act would result in his imminent\nDeath what what hey\nHello why why am I guess oh excuse me why and how it's\nHarold burst into his apartment ransacked the closet throws open doors turns out drawer searching for the voice okay\nWhere are you probably heard you come on you're stupid voice say something\nDesperate now Harold becomes his own narrator Harold frantically grabbed his lamp Harold incense shook it about the room for no apparent reason smash it on the ground stopping\nIt repeatedly come on say something say something say something\n[noise] Harold distraught God Harold the strict\nThan the author speaks not about you this time but to you\nAuthor addresses you personally now I'm going to ask you to stop imagining and just believe part about God being your author it's true\nThere is another part of the story that I haven't been telling you and you need to hear it before it's too late hour author is not limited to one way author character relationships are author is not a solitary on moved mover he's not an evil genius playing with us like puppets are avatars he's a father\nBefore it even started this story from eternity this author has a given take relationship with his son than in the power of his spirit he loves his son in as much as he loves his son this is how much he loves you\nThat's why he created you you know so that you could become not merely a character and his story but he's adopted son his adopted daughter he justified your existence not because of what you could do for him but because of what he wants to do for you\nTo bring you into an authentic to weigh relationship\nFather son father daughter relationship of love and trust and to recreate this relationship of love for us the father sent his only son to be born into history to take the named Jesus to become a character in his own story\nAnd as a character the son suffered all the unanswered questions that you and I suffer as characters in this strike\nAnd his own story\nAnd as a character the son suffered all the unanswered questions that you and I suffer as characters in this strange and sometimes confusing story\nJesus showed us what it looks like to actively strive and to passively suffer as God's loving children in his death he showed us how to express doubt with a job like faith my God oh my God why have you forsaken\nMe he said father into your hands I commit my spirit Luke twenty three forty six\nAnd in his resurrection Jesus showed us how faith weights on the author of life\nGod is God with this or without us yet God became God for us when he became the man Jesus of Nazareth\nFace alone was the phrase that the Protestant Reformers used to describe that to a relationship between God the father and his beloved children the reformers were just following the apostle Paul and they insisted that we are justified we are\n[noise]\nThis has been a presentation of Luther run our

dealer certified financial planner or register investment advisor enjoy the show [noise]\nWelcome to the show as your listener that we are [laughter] my name's Ryan said he was joining us as always my great friends director of a structure Dominic is everyone wants to be like and that is because he\nIs the brains of the operation out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how they're doing doing great Ryan how you doing I'm doing wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun doing the show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd one of the things we always focus the vast majority of our time and I would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets and\nOne of the things we always stress and I I Know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth that consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down with other mark throwing sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and as individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold\nKinda bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that we hold it for a long time and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth uh it's just worth a heck of a whole lot more\nNow what are the things I Want to get some of your feedback on it's always a fun show starter is really the consistency side of things because really if we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction to lead dependent than what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach have take last year it on a train economy one of my favorite things it's really work with the class and get them to viewed down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as well that's so bad 'cause people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith right now is what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the source of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but where some of the things you guys work on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team are are are laying out there right now\nI tell people become more consistent than less directional independent instead of the market\n[noise] we'll come back and if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and top instructor it on my training and we really shuts of life on consistent returns in the market is one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency\nIn the market so many times I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success they've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key\nReally in anything that we do is how can we make money\nConsistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach being able to make money as the markets are going up being able to make money as the markets are going down\nAnd also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time talking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in\nMaybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to ... ... a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you could even call it maybe that that supplemental side that you're talking about a few minutes ago and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental it'd be their primary source of income and I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call\nYou know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who\nAre looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income is a great question right you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy\nWho are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this was a primary source of income that's a great\nQuestion right you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy\nThinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over forty and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they'd lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officers were living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they wanna make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students and he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to a point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade would it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nYeah absolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the happy classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward and really specifically when you ... back to the half day class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry it was just talking about and that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom side and and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month and that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts\nWhere you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing\nAnd part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel it could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it could be the options that could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say there is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about it like that that is that that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we got a little bit of savings to buy us little time but it ended up being that kind of\nThat that that downward spiral or even just stuck in that rat race so to speak of well if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nAnd you know as you're thinking what you were saying and you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the frog if you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you cover the box a couple of times the frog hits the top list\nBut the frog if you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you cover the box ... a couple of times the fraud hits the top lid and even if it just that little way they still can't jump in the higher the way the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking are different definition of of self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagined you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd now not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nYeah absolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom and doing the things we want to do rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more of these passes what he say let's do it right now you have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that's supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time half their classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great were warning that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets\nWell in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half their classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is

three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at ... ... dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow as we're kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what's kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start people\nOff with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and it would ... said as you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great so many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly well not not at all in fact\nMost of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love because if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right we don't want to do that\nBecause we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard this expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart\nWell that's not how people who make a lot of money I think they're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could a worked just one more day that would have been excellent\nWithout getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there is on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could've worked just one more day that would have been excellent now\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love and to think about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you make it a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income but if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nIs going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and that's simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself and hopefully people are listening right now and see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money out of the gates and just you know I Want to I Want to take the dollar and turn it into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay that's not very realistic right but so one of the things we always like to bring that up as it's all about generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness than any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to have first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a big get rich quick program\nThen have to cost probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now or you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in St Louis and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts so again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage that got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last so we start to teachers students right out of the gate\nThat if they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement you can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYou know you're talking about the kind of the cycles with the markets go through the big ups and the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look at him how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so\nKind of that average uh that we can expect is about a fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that yet about a fifty percent drop Becky fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early two thousand fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal but the thing that I went through with my father about a year we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight\nOr you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about dropping accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account\nThey lost fifty thousand and they lost fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value of that fifty thousand that happened in one year and that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down when they take an average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty to take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit\nAnd then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash it could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now it's a little bit of three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nAbsolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to ...\nMost people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nYup absolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really

dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat my dentist offices the kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an Ira or some type of retirement plan which is great and nothing against that but what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs\nAnd so think about it you're in an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you invest in your money and all of a sudden the market corrects well that correction is going to impact the first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into\nSo now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that fifty percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediately at sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the forfeiture isn't housing dividend cuts devastating cuts are all these things have a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and said this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and that in a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started into this multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get 'em out one of the half their classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to
