I think they were from a beep seem I don't know\nTom that were arrested in and they were released because Concord and want to press charges the guys who jumped in will never fight here [noise] they'll never fight here\nNot now maybe McGregor that somewhere press charges and they certainly trespassing issues here yeah could be looked at\nYeah I I just think the whole thing is absolutely disgusting but the ugly in a funny thing is though of after\nThe investigation uh McGregor did get his three mil\nYes he did yeah and then he by the way I just saw this he had to cancel his uh he had a post\nParty you know that they they do with like they do with the D jays and stuff like that and apparently because of credible threats he had to cancel that\nI'm a very one question I wanted to ask you to in and I would ask this no matter who was was president who went out on on a political spots or or rallies who's paying for that because in the past if you were out on a political rally the White House cannot\nPay for it and in campaigns in the past have paid for these things and we're talking about air force one we're talking about stuff we're talking about everything\nThere's always a very complicated discussion that are reporters have with one another about this issue and\nUh sometimes the answers from the White House are not particularly forthcoming and I'm not just for this White House but previous White Houses [noise] what I can tell you traditionally is that there's been some kind of a cost allocation that has been assigned by the air force to the campaigns to basically meet out\nUm the particular\n... political related travel separate from the fact that the president noted states is president United States everywhere he goes it needs to have command and control of the military everywhere he goes and so um but there's the understanding that even though it's a political event in political purposes\nUm the president's trying to achieve that the military has to provide support for him as president everywhere he\nGoes you know a reserve allocation and Secret Service [noise] I'd Secret Service protection and\nUm I mean a whole bunch of ... battery of other things um but but mainly the idea of the the the mobile presidency is um these are things that you know the president can't shake off\nRight right and very very quickly 'cause we're so out of time Kavanaugh last night so\nThat would that was unusual he apologized on behalf of the entire country I don't think a a chunk of the country would agree with that apology but a first time we've seen something like this we we did have a similar ceremony with Obama if I'm not mistaken but obviously a different tone\nOh sure and what was really important to see last night was all eight of Kavanaugh's colleagues on the court present to welcome him into the fold that was an important symbol of visible symbol\nOr you don't often see it and that was why it was important for it to be on display um you'll also don't often hear the president of the words I Apologize but he did it he was making his own political point\nAnd basically twisting the knife I guess\nI'm a ... to say to to Democrats who opposed Kavanaugh\nThat he has been proven innocent well that's not that's not what heroin\nAnd and not only that but uh you know and to extend the metaphor when it comes to juries you know you're found not guilty you never found innocent but they're found not guilty and only when all twelve members of the jury agreed\nThat you're not guilty otherwise it's a hung jury and there is no verdict in this particular case it was very much a hung jury on the part of the Senate forty nine members of the U.S Senate voted not to confer judge capital\nClosest in over a hundred years we

is an investigation and if you got people climbing into the ring taken potshots call it a cheap shots at a McGregor and those guys around on the line from behind yeah exactly\nAre those right and then you know to be themself went in to the crowd as everyone knows and tried to mix it up with a couple of people that just because McGregor is not willing to press charges against those who attacked him and let's be honest they attack them yeah freaks out from behind and two on one in um they they could still be facing some penalties themselves well\nI Would also be curious why they wouldn't still face charges because they did it in front of police officers they saw an attack take place and this wasn't part of a fight the fight was over and wants to fight is over it's no longer a sport it's a physical attack\nYou know this is a big storm this is a monster storm one like we've never seen what I keep hearing this and you know been there done that it seems that some people's attitude is going

known she said\nIn an op ed of when it was a discussion about\nUm other things she said look I may disagree with the president but I tell them to his face when it was about the anonymous op ed I'm and she did disagree with him on several policy she went actually tougher on Russia than he did\nAnd um but he nonetheless she brought the Security Council to the White House\nAs he traveled the world with the Security Council she kept this dual role going where she would remain very popular with un ambassadors despite the Trump Administration and yet she would show her loyalty to President Trump

over again every time we talked about that\nWithin the un community despite the president's position but also she's most popular member of the president's administration including the president\nWell

FBI\nI'm Steve cases Nikki Haley is resigning as the U.S ambassador to the United nations were alive with White House correspondent Steven pork noise\nAnd the president says his UN ambassador approached him about six months ago and said she wanted a break\nMr Trump just told reporters that Nikki Haley will leave the administration at the end of the year it's clearly an amicable departure the to have just been chatting about it with reporters in the oval office and Mr Trump's had Haley's welcome back to the administration anytime she chooses in any role she wants\nThis news has taken officials in Washington and at the un by surprise and several prominent conservatives have voiced their disappointment that Haley is leaving the timing of the announcement is also odd it comes just four weeks before the midterm elections Haley was asked if she's going to run for president in twenty twenty she said no she'll be supporting President Trump said\nOr hurricane Michael is cutting a

speak to and I think that ah hopefully we'll get lucky but maybe that won't happen but we're fair [noise] I wanted to do this because Nikki Haley\nTo the United nations has been very special to me she's done an incredible job\nShe's a fantastic person is\nVery important that you also is somebody that gets it and she has been at the United nations from the beginning with us\nFrom the beginning and work with us so the campaign has been really a long time very intense and she told me probably six months ago she said you know maybe at the end of the year the end of the two year period for the end of the year\nI Want to take a little time off a little but she's been a very successful you know governor of South Carolina for eight years\nAnd then she um she did this and this is possibly the more in tune with what's going on in the world and very dangerous and you know a lot of things\nMuch he's done a fantastic job and we've done a fantastic job together we solve a lot of problems or one of the process of selling a lot of problems at the beginning of North Korea was a massive problem and we're moving along a little bit along\nReally nicely I can speak for\nSecretary of state Mike Pompeo he thinks the world of nicotine and they're so we're all we're all happy for you and one way of hate to lose a new hopefully he'll be coming back if some one you want to just sit and says you can't be a different fashion you're going to have you back\nBut uh I just wanted to let you know so at the end of the year Nikky will be leaving and they will be in constant touch I Know that whenever you have any ideas you're going to go all the players that that was really\nThe thing I think she did best at the United nations you got to know the players [noise] she got to know China Russia a\nHindi as she knows everybody got our very first day basis as they like [noise] except for maybe a couple of normal for us to get all the states they do they really like her and I think maybe more importantly they respect her\nSo I just wanted to tell you that uh we will miss you will be speaking all the time but we will miss you nevertheless and you have done a fantastic\nJob but I Want to thank you very much [noise] well\nI Want to say on that first of all I Want to thank for just you know allowing ...\nWho has resigned as UN ambassador she'll be leaving in the ... the year\nYou know I said I'm such a lucky Charles says then I won't leave just stay up late and serve\nHas really been a blessing and I want to thank you for that but I'm not excited won't get the two year old cat what has happened in two years with the United states on foreign policy now the United states this recession countries may not like\nWe do but that's what we're seeing now is that if we think we're going to do something we follow it through when the president in front of that whether it was with the chemical weapons in Syria whether it would\nSaying that other countries have to pay their share I mean whether to the trade deals which is an amazing they get that the president and his business and they followed through\nBut then if you look at just these two years at the un out one point three billion in the UN but we made a stronger we've made it more efficient\nSouth Sudan we got an arms embargo which was a long time coming green North Korean sanctions um packages which we're the largest and generation done in a way that we could really work towards\nOn the Iran deal bringing attention to the world that every country needs to understand you can't overlook followed the bad things they're doing you have to see them for the threat that they are [noise] um I think you look at the anti Israel bias and the strength\nAnd courage that the president showed and moving the embassy and showing the rest of the world and we put our embassy where we want to put our and\nNikki Haley is resigning as un regime white nose with a few moments ago\nGave us a strong again and the U.S is drawing in a way that should make all Americans very proud and\nI Do want to say that it's not just surprising and I want to say I'm for the family in general and the first lady has been nothing but very very kind to me um I Can't say enough good things about Jared ... is such a\nGenius that no one understands I mean to redo the NAFTA deal the way he did um what I've done working with him on the middle east peace plan it is so unbelievably well done and an office in just a great friend and they do a lot of things behind the things\nThat I Wish more people knew about because we're a better country because they're in\nUm the to administration I also just have to say I'm certainly thank you my family Michael at the same and um my two little ones I adore them entertain us un you know they sacrificed a lot they put a lot of time\nAnd energy into it um but and they have a lot of heart and really wanted to make America a proud and so with that\nI'm not leaving until the end of the year my

have anything he sat on where I'm going to go I think that um the main thing was I was governor for six years and we've dealt with a hurricane a thousand year flood or church shooting at school shooting there was a lot and then to come in and\nJust two years of Russia and Iran and North Korea it's been eight years of intense time and I'm a believer in term limits I think you have to be

twenty no I'm not running for twenty twenty I can promise you what are we doing is campaigning for this one so I'll look forward to supporting the president them and I'm Still actually ... it was\nTo go off you know your own heart which is a really personal decision on because you get away from your family members or you don't ...\nMy family is very supportive so no there's no personal reasons I think that it's just a very important for government officials to understand when it's time\nAside and I haven't given everything I've got the last eight years and I do they fit sometimes just so due\nIn other people who can put that same energy and power into it and so there really is a lot of people are going to want to say there's a lot of reasons why I'm leaving the\nIs that the president of France\nIt was a blessing to go into the un firearm\nEvery day and defend America um and I always say that I'll never truly\nThat does seem to be especially with this group that that is fascinating

no she's not running a Twenty one and we don't know who's going to be taking\nReplace this is a story that popped up from Bloomberg that is a ... just really disturbing the headline nursing homes are pushing the dying into pricey rehab joining us right now from Bloomberg is reporter Riley Griffin\nElderly residents given intensive therapy in the last weeks of life\nJumped sixty five percent why are they doing this\nWell basically this to the question of ultra high intensity rehab therapy which is a classification used to that meet the amount of treatment given to skilled nursing home patient\nSo that ultra high treatment exceeds seven hundred and twenty minutes\nA week of therapy which can range from speech to physical therapy which is more than twelve hours a week basically the study found that the proportion of nursing home rather than to receive ultra high rehab increase by a whopping sixty five percent between twenty ... twenty six team and so while this kind of therapy isn't that in and of itself\nWhat's concerning is that he's a resident were found to be with the highest concentration during the very last week of life and the author or to your question suggests that this could be interfering with\nPatients ability to get other forms of care like hospice and it financially motivated\nSo when we're talking about the highest concentration of rehabilitation during their last week a life I mean if they're in their last week a life what in the world are they doing at a bed I mean if they're in that kind of state that's that is horribly troubling\nExpert basically pointed to different conclusions one is that perhaps nursing home um perhaps those issuing the treatment don't recognize that they're in their last week of life or\nParticularly for for profit on this could be in the in to try to maximize on the high end reimbursement rate knowing that despite knowing that a patient at the end of life\nReporter for Bloomberg I'm I'm not going to give them the first one I'm not going to I've got a very it's with this\nAh being in charge of people in my life in my family ah in in facilities and they don't get to pass on the first one number one you shouldn't be in that position if you don't recognize\nThat somebody is in their last days and number two I I have heard numerous times that so and so a friend of my aunt for instance is in her last days it's obvious this is what they do for a living\nSo they don't it's not for me that they don't get a pass I think this has to do with money clearly very clearly\nAnd the study itself the findings underscore that the University of Rochester found that for profit nursing nursing homes what two times as likely the high tech ultra high and we had a non profit nursing home\nWell then I'm thinking to Riley that at this point you you're talking law suits because you are to give care that uh gives them comfort and takes care of them in in their final days this to me is like giving somebody and proper medication\nMhm even simply after publishing next morning I received enough trauma number of people actually farting documentation of that manner\nAnd I want to remind everybody too because again I've had to go down this road in every state in we're included you can report in a nursing home if there's a situation like this if you see something wrong you can report\nA nursing home because they are absolutely positively regulated in it's this kind of reporting to remind everybody about this\nIs real news this isn't fake this is something that maybe you might not have known about and if you are taking care of somebody you're in charge of somebody's care as I Am it's important that you know about the situation so you know what to look for Riley Griffin reporter with Bloomberg\nThank
