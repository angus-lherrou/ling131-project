on wakeup Las Vegas let's say you for now this is a Senator Chuck Grassley the chairman of the Judiciary Committee Republican\nWho has nearly twenty five years of experience advocating for sexual assault victims and investigating sex times concluded that there was lack of specificity\nAnd simply too many inconsistency and Dr Ford's allegations do establish that judge Kavanaugh committed sexual assault even under the lowest standard of proof she concluded quote a he said she said case is incredibly difficult to\nBrew but this cases even weaker than that Dr Ford identify other witnesses to the event so knows witnesses either refuted or allegations or fail to wreak\nCorroborate them for the reasons disgust me all I Do not think that a reasonable prosecutor could bring this case based upon the evidence before the committee nor do I believe that this evidence is sufficient to satisfy the preponderance of evidence standard end quote\nAll right you've been listening to Senator Chuck Grassley the Republican chairman Kevin\nUh uh the Senate Judiciary committee just for this vote ... coming up in forty five minutes you'll be hearing from Diane Feinstein as well from the Dems are the leading them uh the ranking minority member as well and what Senator Grassley was referring to was a special prosecutor from Phoenix, Arizona\nWho was asked to come in and do the questioning for the Republican men but then they change their mind when it came to a to interviewing Kavanaugh well speaking of what was going on with Kevin things\nTypically is Jackson Cosco charged with\nPosting restricted information is the crime in unauthorized access to government document is the other that he's charged with that he was charged by US Capitol police\nThis is a man at Jackson Cosco who was only an intern for the congresswoman or forty days and after the arrest the congresswoman decided the court ways with Cosco um again who had not been with her campaign or with or a office for very long so they decided to fire him\nAfter that arrest came down to obviously releasing those numbers are like that an address as it's something that is not permitted at something that the Congress woman said she wasn't going to tolerate this was an unpaid intern\nA this is by the way a lot of people wonder what the term is when they see it on social media called doc sing and that is correct me if I'm wrong it's documenting are releasing documents on er documentation on what ah ah you know where somebody lives what they're near where the kid goes to school et cetera\nAnd it's the first time I've ever heard of anybody actually getting busted for something that I think is very violent specially when we have such a heated nomination\nYeah you know you're exactly right I've heard of it before in fact there's been several recent cases as well as up different leaders congressmen and things like that getting their addresses or phone numbers we're east but\nThis is the first time that we're seeing a charge at least on a high scale especially with the Kavanaugh hearings your\nUh uh one actually getting arrested and charged with this\nAnd the same point this is someone who was if oil it whether it be paid paid or not enter for forty days or not\nThis was a representative of the Democratic congresswoman so it didn't look good I don't think the firing there was much of a choice there but it is interesting that charges were filed against this man\nIt's also interesting that exist twenty seven year old ... men and he's working for free [laughter] doesn't have a full time job but I digress I'm\nI'm kinda curious do we know why he did this what in the world would motivate somebody I mean\nI you know you remember when you were twenty seven years old and hopefully had a little bit of street smarts if you're if you're working in Washington DC you just don't do something like that it isn't okay no matter how passionate you are about a particular cause\nYeah you know we haven't heard from him yet as to what his exact motivations were but you have to think it could either be a politics maybe he got caught up in this scene how many protesters there have been and just how heat it this is how emotional this like hearing that has been for so many people\nEither that or just the fact that he's young and didn't think that he would get caught or just got caught up in the moment I guess it could be either\nWell clearly the working for free and twenty Seventy is not exactly a brain surgeon what ah what what does he face what kind of jail time 'cause he faced\nA you know he could face a several months in prison this something they're in jail this isn't something that brings a hefty penalty but again they eat it loses his job and if you're entering for a democratic congresswoman you'd like to climb the ladder and I think that his name is hampered now this is something in politics that\nFrom the justice of ... ... am not Las Vegas ...

what this she's going to be announcing her a final decision on a Kevin ... coming up on you and let's get back to the Senate majority leader\nAnd before the anchor dried on judge Kavanaugh's nomination colleagues across the aisle including democratic members of the Judiciary Committee were racing to announce they'd made up their minds are more totally opposes confirmation\nMere hours after judge Kavanaugh was nominated my friend the Democratic leader promise quote I Will oppose him with everything I've got to be set hours after he was nominated\nIt was about a clearer that his number one political goal was to defeat the nomination by any means necessary\nIt was right there from the beginning madam president a clear declaration plain as day nothing nothing good yet most Democrats or consider this nominated with an open mind it would be delaying tactics obstruction and so called\nResistance until the final vote was called\nFor a few weeks there are France played out along the lines that sadly have become somewhat ordinary around here there\nWere excuses for delay those fell flat\nThere were broach distortion to judge Kavanaugh's record that were better down by outside factor effort and there were all the usual fall day apocalyptic pronouncements that are shouted whenever a Republican president Derek denominator Supreme Court justice and every time\nBut here's the problem they all players weren't working the distortions were being literally drowned out by the facts\nSenators were saved and review more pages of background materials on judge Kavanaugh's nomination for every previous Supreme Court nomination come by we read judge Kavanaugh's twelve your record or judicial rulings from our nation's second highest court three hundred plus\nOpinions\nWere sworn testimony written a couch from\nHungary listening ... ... when I was laughing for three minutes ahead of this initial below headed by these five on the uh the girls go this

vote that will be coming up at\nNo matter more try\nSomething new they said well we all know what happened\nNext I'm corroborated allegations\nOf the most sensitive most serious or were quickly sharpen into political weapons\nOne such allegations shared by Dr Ford and coughing up through the Democratic side of the Judiciary Committee\nSomehow\nMysteriously found its way into the press\nWell Germany Grassley admittedly set out on a sober focus search for the truth the committee selected tested all organized a new hearing and most recently I asked for the supplemental FBI background investigation\nJudge Kavanaugh's seventh seventh FBI investigation\nBy any first that are the facts the actual facts to base straightforward no corroborating evidence not not\nWas producers support any of the allegations leveled against judge Kavanaugh\nNo corroborating evidence from the FBI and for our or from anywhere else nothing well that wasn't enough\nFor our democratic colleagues of course the facts were not exactly the point after always or to get it by now\nWhen the very FBI investigation for which they had been clamoring turned up no new evidence\nDemocrats move the goal posts yet again\nSeven twenty eight Michael Kastner with you hear that Senator Mitch McConnell the Senate majority leader just a about a minute or so ahead of the vote on Kavanaugh the initial vote on

Kavanaugh they did get the initial votes on this morning to move forward with the final vote you know voting\nYes before they vote on the final vote here is what it sounded like on the floor to question\nIs is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh Maryland to be an associate justice of the Supreme Court shall be brought to a close\nAnd then the votes came in and it was very clearly are not unanimous a very very bitterly divided Senate but they have moved forward we are seeing some surprise votes though\nA we know that several centers of not said how they're going to be\nDoing their final vote Murkowski of Alaska who voted no for this initial vote Jeff Flake of Arizona and Democrat Joe Manchin\nOf West Virginia I'm we know that uh we are going to hear about\nCollins final vote she voted yes for the initial vote Susan Collins has not made it known what she's going to do with this final vote the or the tally fifty one forty nine it's a squeaker it's a squeaker now and some voted yes that could very well be voting no in the final vote so it's not clear\nAble to get pushed through\nWe are hearing you know the president is making phone calls we are hearing that former President Bush forty three has been twisting arms\nOr Kevin I used to work for Bush forty three so we're going to keep you posted on what's going on there wanted to give you some local news is well Nevada Democrats followed them watching complaint with Nevada secretary of state Barbara\n... office alleging she violated state election laws by failing to disclose who paid for her campaign television at\nThe complaint filed with the gas ... office also says\nHer ad did not included were choir message stating that the candidate had approved the at Nevada deputy secretary of state free elections Wayne ... at the office is reviewing the complaint but has not made a determination yet he says candidates who failed to include proper disclosures typically are asked to fix their ads\nHe says the gas he has no role in the investigation her office is doing Fred Hoff dead K exit the news and\nUh we're going to be hearing from Senator Cortez mass do we will be doing an interview with her about her vote we do know she said this just a short time ago\nWhen I hear I fought for victims right I Know that part of a thing too I wanted to have a full investigation of town which is always done how we got 'em\nIt's a lifetime appointment this isn't a political decision if that's where a political decision for me I certainly wouldn't be deciding this\nUm but I you know there's an old saying history will judge you but most importantly you'll judging south and that's really what I'm saying I Can't get up in the morning and look at the life experience that I've had and say yes to judge Kavanaugh\nSo the question is do other senators are like flake who's you know he's a he's a lame duck like Murkowski who could go either way and she's still get support in Alaska or like snow or are they going to go the way of Heitkamp\nWell again I think this was a very personal question for all of them you have to imagine that Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell is pushing them very very hard they're getting lobbied from the White House there probably being told look if we keep the Senate\nAnd you don't vote on our side you may not get as many favors from us so there's certainly facing that thinking about\nHow that could affect their re election in other ways or their relationship with their home state\nI'm so there are a lot of different factors involved here um I think what is very telling is the fact that a judge Kavanaugh felt a need to publish an op ed in the wall Street Journal last night basically saying yes he may have gotten too emotional or and there are some things he wished she didn't say\nWhat that tells me is a he knows that this is a problem that whole temperament issue\nHe knows that he crossed some some lines in the in his testimony as appearance before the Judiciary Committee and it also tells me that despite Mitch McConnell's in the White House is\nSort of apparent confidence on all of this they're still not sure where those senators are going to vote and there was even one other report I'm not so sure how reliable dishes but again it's out there from the Denver Post that a senator Cory Gardner who had been a yes vote on Kavanaugh\nHaving some second thoughts so look this is a serious appointment this is not even just in the court appointment or district court this is the Supreme Court right one of nine individuals who can put their you know a stamp on the our nation's future and future generations\nIt's a big vote in and I hope they do have a uh think about this and think about this seriously because that's their job to senators\nWe are learning right now to the to senator mentioned a key damage still undecided on Kevin CBS News political analyst Leonard Steinman thanks so much for being
