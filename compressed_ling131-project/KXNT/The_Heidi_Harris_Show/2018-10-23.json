obviously Sandra Day O'Connor was a trend setter because\nShe started [noise] she she broke through the glass ceiling at the Supreme Court the first female Supreme Court justice on\nThe court let's take you to Phoenix this morning and I'm Monica lunchroom who is a a a legal and was from Sandra Day O'Connor's home state we got the news this morning that ah the Sandra Day O'Connor is pulling back from public life because she has a dimension of the onset\nOf a ... you know she is one of the time she was the first\nYeah she was quite an ... well she's still is quite an amazing woman that she was quite an amazing that justice she was on the Supreme Court for a number of years out from Nineteen eighty one until she retired in two thousand six\nAnd during that time and she she was kind of middle of the road she was the justice that always listen to what was going on at Erica since she didn't always write her opinions or\nMake her decision based on the other justices or what she may think is what is right or wrong she actually listen to America and saw the changing high tides and\nHow Americans were reacting to things and that oftentimes is what she took into consideration when she made her decision and we haven't had a lot of just like that\nWe often hear about justices who are left or who are right or if cetera do you think that there's anybody on the court now who really models themselves after her and guess what because I'm not going to be sexist and say that it has to be a woman is there are men who models himself after\nI wouldn't say that any model themselves after her because she truly was whatever kind of ... but we really don't have any justices that seem to gravitate towards\nThe way that she thought how she was that the conservative in the middle yeah we have a conservative on the bench but again she was someone who listen to the people\nAnd we don't really have that right now we have a very strong conservative\nA bench that a lot of people are scared about and worried about and I can understand why because\nThe times that we had with Justice O'Connor and the decisions that were made and where those decisions when well probably not going to reach that point for very long time it meaning she would look at the liberal as well as the conservative side even though she was or conservative and and take everything into consideration\nMonaco Lindstrom a
