CNN\n[noise] sure why not apologize in advance I can always pay for a few minutes Michael but now we're talking about all the time I listen I think we're at a significant point just before the midterm elections and they've missed her elections are probably the most important we've had a dozen years or more\nUm and I think as has been brought to ahead now by these\nBombs or whatever these devices are that are being sent people took ... discovered the chance of Joe Biden or a today and there there may be more out there that fortunately no one's been killed job but I Do think that we are facing a real question you know\nUm whether people are just getting so red hot about these elections so polarized so poisonous um whether we're we're reaching a point where violence becomes part of our political life which would just be terrible\nUm I I I was surprised and disappointed this morning to see the new tweet by President Trump\nI thought he was going to cool it or after a statement yesterday about bringing us together and try to you know come together on this which I Would very much prove up\nUm but then he went out today are slamming editorial about you know how your tweet about how the press is responsible for all this news or CNN just received a package\nYesterday had to evacuate the building um and so that they are very disappointed because I just think that he and his team just they do not appreciate\nUh how ... how much his words can ...\nAnd ... other people to the extreme max and extreme views are his attacks on the press have made the press feel very vulnerable\nUm and you know this is just extremely unhealthy for the country to be a situation my own personal view is that Donald Trump has unleashed the dogs of hatred in this country or any right from the day first declared\nA on a on on it award shows but at the same time as we have to remind everybody sadly as you and I do our jobs every day because it's guaranteed in the first not the second or third not the Fort the first amendment oh you do have a right to free speech and the United states of America and you don't deserve to die\nJust because you speak up when we are\nSeeing this now I've seen the uh the photo is well of the deniro device and already the Biden device very unusual for especially for federal authorities to put out this much information\nObviously it's being done because they want the public's helping because they release those photos yesterday this De Niro package was discovered\nShe I mean one of the reasons uh one of the benefits from putting out the information is that when these security personnel saw this we believe they immediately recognized that having seen the pictures either on TV or newspapers and were able to call police all of this may be a very very wise move by the authorities get\nThey usually don't like to show their hand but\nIn this case or it may have been a very very wise move and may lessen\nNone of these devices have exploded yet\nBut it doesn't mean that they can fix them and this may have been a very very good thing that they've\nDone we're talking with CBS News correspondence even find them in in New York

everything last night was pretty much back to normal warns the device is removed and the ... the police go through the area to make sure there are no other devices\nA there's really no reason for the place to be there except to\nMaybe show people that they are on duty or maybe a\nA show people that don't do anything that you're not supposed to do but uh last night and especially today Time Warner center seems very much back to normal now there may be heightened security measures inside\nCertain buildings for businesses that we don't necessarily see that would be an extra security check but beyond that show the police presence work sometimes you just see everywhere you look at least we're not seeing\nBut beyond that show the police presence work sometimes you just see everywhere you look at least we're not seeing that at all outside Tom Ritter center and even here outside the trip back Tribeca Grill\nTo devise was removed the police presence greatly diminish\nAnd finally I'm going to say something that not everybody knows that I'm not saying this just because we're CBS affiliate hats off to your company because when CNN was forced to the streets the streets\nAre the head of CBS offered the facilities of CBS down the road to CNN to continue any coverage any support that they needed and that is what this country is supposed to be all about CBS on the go ahead this\nDoes this does happen often when one for example sometimes we've had a news paper right uh they're they're they're building gets uh uh uh they can use it for some reason a lot of fire or whatever and then
