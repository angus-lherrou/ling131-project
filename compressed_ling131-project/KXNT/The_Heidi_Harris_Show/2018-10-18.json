White House radio CBS News White House correspondent\nConstant teeny Bob we understand right this minute or at least last I heard the ... the United states was meeting with the secretary of state Mike Pompeo we expect cameras in there any kind of re don't end up back we do\nNot expect to have cameras and microphones inside the meeting in the oval office apparently where the president\nI should write about now be meeting with secretary of state Mike Pompeo after his two day emergency mission to Saudi Arabia and then to turkey regarding the disappearance of democracy so she ends up you know what he may have learned\nA pill or even with the reporters who were traveling with him didn't really say all that much of preferring perhaps do a report to the president what he may have learned\nBut at the at this point we don't expect to hear from either one of them in terms of a a a release the allowing cameras inside we may eventually get what's called a readout of the meeting\nAnd then later on today the president when he departs for a three day up\nThree state a rally swing or later today we may hear from him at that but what we just don't know it's obviously whether or not the president's may be terribly convinced about anything\nIn particular are with this situation Michael\nWell I don't get it was when you are the pros United\nLike this man has to make you can call turkey and say you've got audio let me hear it I Want to get it to my intelligence people\nWhat we don't know [laughter] right well because well given us a call yesterday with asked\nAbout that or are those kinds of things and whether the FBI\nI was going to be involved in anything in terms of helping that the Turks are our intelligence agencies other president wouldn't say he sort of snap back at the questioner or maybe you maybe we do and we don't you don't know that\nUm but also a he was very sensitive to the idea of whether or not he is effectively covering for the Saudi royal family a which now a lot of observers in this country clearly believe I would've known about what happened to ... uh beforehand\nOr inside the consulate there is done ball but Michael or the president has repeated denials of the king and the crown prince and uh that's kind of where we've left it ah it's ah just waiting to hear from\nA what comes out of this meeting with my palm pale\nThe thing though that is so bothersome as well and we're talking with one White House correspondent Bob constant teeny is that we seem to be relying on the Saudis are investigating themselves and and you know not to be taking sides on what's going on with the president is like the president investigating himself\nYou have you know you can say the same thing with Clinton or Nixon going back and so everybody doesn't scream at me but when you have accusations involving particular person you don't let them investigate themselves we're talking about the king and the prince or who hopes to be king and he seems to be running the government\n... that we're accusing of knowing or thinking that he had some sort of a knowledge of what's going on you don't let them investigate themselves\nWell most of the people up on Capitol Hill who spoken out a lot about this particular matter a are speaking out against the crown prince Mohammed I'm saying that uh you know someone maybe who has to go now how we could do that or whatever it is as a sovereign nation\nOr the other issue that may be in play here a little bit is uh the the idea of diplomatic immunity that this consulate was effectively Saudi um the territory if you will and the Turks were only allowed in\nA just a couple of days ago with a ... two weeks after a stroke she went in there so uh you know but the Turks have um the put out the idea that he was killed inside there and Turkish media\nHave put forth some rather grizzly kind of details grizzly timeline in particular about what the audio if it exists may reveal and all of this again a we have no particular confirmation of any of the things that we've been hearing about this Michael\nIs a ... and when you say by the way is kind of gruesome details of that is an absolute understatement and I hope that this is not being taken seriously the things that this man was put through\nAh from what it sounds like and then the fact that the cleaners come in and they came in and reinvented\nWe all get what happened I mean you know watch one episode of forty eight hours to get an idea of of ah of of what they were or what they were thinking very quickly for let you go sure are they considering it's a crisis in ... you know the the cable news headlines crisis inside the White House do they consider ...\nI I Would imagine they do yes so that's why palm pale was sent there very quickly and by the way ... talking about confirmation link point out I'm Talking about from U.S officials say hello Jens ... aid not necessarily\nHuh and by the way ... talking about confirmation would point out I'm Talking from U.S officials allergens are aid not necessarily what the Turks are saying or what the Saudis say\nRight and we're both were also saying some from America we're we're seeing better investigations being done by journalists and we're seeing from the Washington Post and the New York times they've done terrific drones and that's part of what the job\nIs that they have to do All right Westwood One course one White House correspondent Bob ... thanks so much for being with us on Michael thank you take her to wake up Las Vegas Michael cast and with you here\nOn news talk eight forty ... chief it's Thursday it must be meet the press indeed we are going to be talking with truck dog the moderator of the Seventy one year old program can you believe it's been around since the forties boy have things changed we'll talk about ah the\nOr is that the other party at least grabs something they they they get right so that's so that would not be a surprise want to ask you this though president says if the Republicans lose the house it's not his fault is it his fault if it happens how the\nIt by the way mid term elections are always referendum on President yeah so it's a thousand percent his fault it just goes bronco promised Bolton twenty ten and twenty fourteen Bill Clinton fault Nineteen Ninety\nFour don't forget what you found out that the company you gotta you gotta remember the ... or something right it was one of the great George W. Bush has this was a bump it was of dumping\nIt's always about the president right it is and especially when you look when you look at where the house seats are are are being put in play there in the areas where he yet if he's driving it\nLoss of college educated white women I'm from the Republicans and Democrats that is a total immediate reaction to the president so when you look at how the Democrats appear to be winning and some of these suburban house seat\nIt it it's all on the president pure and simple there's no other there there there's just there's no other you can't sit there and say oh it's because they didn't do we're finished repealing a health care they didn't do that now it's a referendum on the press\nA final question when I ask you you know it did to a little a research and I knew that this year showed been around for quite a long time I was surprised at Seventy one years old you have a lot of ah heritage on\nYour shoulders more and more baby boomers wherever they are that you know the baby boomer\nAnd and when I was uh when I was a kid reporter in Washington I go out on Sunday Morning in Nebraska avenue waiting for the newsmakers for meet the press to come out there so\nI I have a great deal of reverence for the history there I'm curious how you feel about the attack on the media on our very station here Rush Limbaugh calls it defeat the press or know defeat to\nDefeat the press or to face the nation is uh other terminology that he uses how I feel about the attacks on the media\nI look it's ... it's a tactic and one of the things that you know I Try to remind my own staff I Try to remind younger journalist is that it's a tactic I think one of the things that we don't point out enough that it's a tactic look at all it is it's pure and simple it is a political\nTactic policy there any room service he yes exactly I and I think it it um I understand politically why they do and it works yeah however um\nI Do think that we in our industry having pointed it out enough and I think that when I pointed out to individuals individuals\nEmailed me and the only complaint to know basically parrots something that the boss at our Hannity said and then I'll push back\nA and explain I said you know if I were making this up I'd be fired like this is how it works is that the if the you know that's how ... works at a real news organization and and I pointed things that look that's why this person got fired I play the ... and individually people get it\nBut I think one of the problems is when you have a constant propaganda machine\nThat says a depressive by specify affected by that no one town or is it with actual back over time people people want to believe in and look we're the we're the ones covering this stuff I\nGet it by the way you know the ... getting angry um at press coverage all you do this with Trump could do this with Trump you don't do that you know ... they're gonna they're gonna throw they can't apparently throws that they want to throw him at the mirror when they look into it at themselves so they taught us something about us\nUm but I think it's been debilitating and spin it is something that I've personally tried to reassess like\nAt themselves so they are something that I um but I think it's been debilitating and its than it is something that I've personally tried to reassess like how do we read flight
