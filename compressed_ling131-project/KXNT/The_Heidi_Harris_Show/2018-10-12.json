kinda chilly out however\nYes it is a we have an update on a story and I don't know about you but I was curious what happened to that you know the banks he painting you know the girl with the balloon and as soon as it was sold at Sotheby's it went through a shredder right and then there's and that was right after it was sold\nWell did did the person keep it your ...\nWould you buy a damaged painting the woman who made more than a million pounds for Banksy paintings which rag itself at the moment and sale has gone ahead with the purchase there were gassed sin laugh since the lower half a girl with the balloon was sucked into a shredder him and its frame\nThe unnamed female European collector till ... she was shocked at first\nBut then realized she'd end up with her own piece of our history yard work has been given a new name loved is in the band Pam colder CBS News\nLove is in the ... and now here's the deal you go into what was that the frame shop color and then gets out of business now a errands they always had really great deals like two for one of you know can I help you yes okay here's the deal I had this friend that's actually a paper shredder okay and\nPainting and I have it got shredded okay so I Need a frame for the frame it kind of attached to the bottom sort of because you want the rest of the Banksy paintings to be\nFor you know preserved because you're talking about something is going to be worth even more millions later on I don't know how they make those Banksy by the way did put a video up\nOf it very well just guys but show was very very briefly showed that he had he had installed vis a shredder in the bottom of the frame and then there was also alarmed that went off kind of like a truck backing up beep beep beep and as soon as that thing took off\nIt started to got sold it started just a\n... to the bottom of the frame which was actually shredder fascinating story and so so Banksy great artist but um [noise] he's a bit of a rebel I'm sure he was funny as teenagers it's eight twenty nine Michael cast with you and wake up Las Vegas you\nTwo thousand five and you reported on national television so you said that the incumbent Republican President George W. Bush didn't care about black people\nWhy do you believe this man does and and how do you how do you explain the ah the distinction and\nMr west indirectly answered the question I except to say that he was um motivated by emotion in two thousand five and also I think something along the lines of he was corrupted\nGod held fair mentality yeah\nSay that a Donald Trump or a spouse has a different philosophy of empowerment and that was the the fence you did get not to over analyzed but that's the since you got from tiny west that he felt that\nDonald Trump empowers black people and he certainly is a black man felt empowered to where the make America great again hat he said it made him feel like Superman is opposed to Hillary Clinton's\nCampaign message which was I'm with her which county west said lacked male energy\nYeah and by the way then he hugged Jonathan Karl who was befuddled which I've never seen him be federal work but he seemed befuddled yeah uh-huh uh\nI Hope things are better today I just do we have a ...
