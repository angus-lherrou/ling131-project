us right now is Larry Magid CBS News\nTechnology analyst ... what was it that uh that he brought to the table when it came to Microsoft and gates\nWell he had to be in the ideas behind the the Microsoft BASIC which was the original\nSoftware it so if you go back to the early to mid seventies basic with running on mainframe computer if it was a a a language can high liberal\nLanguage did with not too hard to write\nAnd he heard about the micro computer revolution that wasn't even a revolution it with the kind of the trickle of little companies in Albuquerque New Mexico and elsewhere like all care that we're working on these very primitive nitric computers\nAnd he realized he would need a language for these computers to be useful so he came to gates a with a Harvard and they wrote a basic and\nThey formed a company called Microsoft hyphen in the middle and the rest of its history now the the big break came in Nineteen eighty one and that's where I got involved not so much with Paul Allen but with the industry when IBM\nDecided to build their own personal computer and they came to Microsoft and said we needed operating system\nA Microsoft didn't have one and Allen with

in eighty two that were the original original doubt it of a non Hodgkin's lymphoma and I think that about when he left Microsoft which was not\nToo long after the company was really started to take off but of course he owned in a stock and he's still made a tremendous amount of money but yeah Microsoft had its ups and downs of both before a Allen left and of course later on if it's government
