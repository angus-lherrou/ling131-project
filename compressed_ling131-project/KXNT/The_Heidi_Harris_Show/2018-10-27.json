and we'd like to uh put texture in it ah but I'd like to do it as simply as possible so she couldn't shirt and paint and I like more information about that or what you recommend\n... to use an additive in people's rights we usually get the option of course most people ... to protect her away so [laughter] so I Would say ... you're really sure you want to do this because once it goes on there it's hard to make it a week ago or\n... yes I mean our other walls have some texture I mean and it's not a heavy texture it's just a little bit to make it and just not a flat sheet rock\nAnd it's a texture and the painter it's an actual texture within the drywall itself almost like a ...\nWhile I'd rather not go that route as the the the ... um I'd like to add texture the pain just to give the wall something other than the mood drywall well\nThere's a couple of different techniques that you can use\n'em first there's something called the linen technique that's done with almost like a wallpaper brash sort of a very short stiff bristle that's you know maybe twelve inches to Eighteen Inches wide\nAnd you put the paint on and then you should have dragged that brush through and that gives you a linear texture to it and that can kind of look like wallpaper and you can do it with one color or do a base color and a lot that dry and then\nPut a coat on top and then dragged outlined through um you could do something that's almost called the I guess it is actually called the Venetian plaster\nBut that involves you know sort of marveling the texture on and and burning it and rubbing and it really is a heavier coat of paint and plaster but that gives a really interesting sort of cloudy textural look that sometimes has a high shine to it\nUm there's a swayed texture I think Ralph Lauren is one of the teams that make that\nAnd that has um it really does look like sway that has that sort of like rubbed softer not looking texture to it there's a standard finish where there's actual stand in the pain sometimes I can feel a little rough almost like a sand paper\nBut um that gives the nice texture to they all have different application technique so if I were looking at a paint that has a specific texture and home center I'd make sure that I really read the directions and looked at what that manufacture was recommending for the application process and get those correct tools and do the proper prep work for it\nBecause some of those textures or you know kind of labor intensive forward the wire and you want to make sure you get it right\nAbsolutely [laughter] okay well I'll look into the uh\nYou suggested here and make a decision that I Hope that helps you own it\nRight absolutely [laughter] okay well I Will look into that um things you suggested here and make a decision that I Hope that helps you out it does say something much\nWell now that we are entering heating fees and then maybe a lot of your actually already in the heat in full swing this time of year you really want to try and get the most out of your energy dollar and to do that you've got to keep that draft but those aren't only just found it really ...\nYeah now my favorite place that sneaky drafts happen\nOr switch plates and outlets annexed your ear walls you know air gets into those walls and those address from the outside will just zipped right in the inside is they are not properly seal the fix is very simple\nYou can pick up some pre cut phone gas gets they're available at home centers and hardware stores are literally pains of peace and then slip them under the cover place to do a great job of keeping those drafts out\nI mean surely it's like one of the least expensive improvement they can make that will make a very noticeable difference in your extensive which it's just amazing to me the other thing if you find that you have a larger gaps exterior walls\nYou can try and fill this African expand both on and that's going to stop the Airflow ... and a lot of cases it's not going to stop any road ends our pets from coming in so if you want to do that as well you can make them a little while just to strengthen it up and keep the little rodent ads from chewing there my aunt\nYeah good point so lots of ways to try to cut back on those traps but I'll tell you what they do add up so given the now before I could see terribly cold it'd be a lot more comfortable all winter long name can you get the name of the day\nI got to issue with a little league team feeling I'm not sure if it's coming from from my roof or from our conditioners uh doesn't do it all the time that sometimes when it rains it comes down to earth and other times it's not right and they have\nAbout [laughter]\nOr or or got kinda that allows we've got a metal roof structure house right now I'm thinking maybe the grip they get they don't want more goes into a good er and you know that walk that I've not had any luck because although I have it fixed and then it it will come of rain and we got married again\nIt comes in again right so what they're doing the fiction that he was dealing the seems in the in the metal roof\nWhen we got up and put a some talk of the stuff on ... you know where the edge of stuff was and and that are supposed to be a twenty year roof and we had it on the house rather\nWait a minute this is a metal roof is supposed to be a a hundred year roof metal ribs last a long time here's what I Would do I would try to make it so I Would go up there if you can you get up there that area with a hose yeah so I Would try to make it leaks I Would try\nYou know the normal light duty rainfall when it falls down from the top and see that there's anything and then I Would try some directional pressure against those scenes and see if I can figure out what type of driving rain storms coming in your ... I suspect that is do the rain\nA driving in those in it might be trapped in there and his wife ... comes out days later after ... I don't know but I I think what you're gonna have to do is to try to figure out what part of that is breaking down and then once you do if you already going the Koch route I Would just taken apart that section of the roof\nAnd then putting it back together with the proper ceiling to make sure you get it done once and for all\nRight okay All right ... ...\n... ... we've got to repair the Salem to or not or a part of the ...\nYeah I Know you ... you got his gun and by the way when you do repair that ceiling make sure use primer on it because if you don't prime over leaks things that they're going to come right through now since ... okay\nMake sure you primer on it because if you don't\nPrime over leaks things that they're going to come right through now since ... okay\nYeah I'm actually

local hardware store about ten miles and you feel more packed with\nWhat he or do you need called her back then I don't know what the different are\nOK so first of all the type of repair mature uses\nDifferent type of material you would use if you were supporting a new concrete slab and you mentioned quick read us a great friend and they have a wide variety of repair products um you have the option to repair the cracks you could also re surface that concrete is a product for that\nAnd in all cases they the difference between that type of product a repair product in the original sort of concrete ... is it the repair parts are designed to adhere to the original concrete base\nYou know if it's if anything is loose course if the pop it out and restore it but I'm sure that there are plenty of country repair products that are out there and you know you're going to obviously have to get yourself to hardware store or lumber yard and find it\nYou can do some research on line that their website but you want to make sure you choose a repair product because it is designed specifically to adhere to those surfaces\nOkay thank you so much All right\nGood luck it eight six six six

into everyday wins and Halloween fright night twelve months a year Sunday Morning at five ... news talk eight forty AM K accent the [noise]\nAnd welcome back to back guys at the movies with Kevin car let's jump right into the movie reviews well at least I'd like to jump right into the ... there's been a couple of snack foods out there\nAnd and I think snap who's the right term it's you know what is now booming I'll give you the clean version situation\nAll fouled up the situation is very normal this happens all the time usually I let the stuff for all off my back\nI live in Columbus ohio I live in the heartland flyover country I Am not in one of the biggest markets out they're not New York or LA or Chicago I'm not even Cleveland Cleveland gets more screenings and I do and it is not uncommon for studios too\nLA or Chicago I'm not leaving Cleveland Cleveland gets more screenings and I do\nAnd it is not uncommon for studios to\nNot screened everything in my market and little sometimes be huge movies like that I remember the first draft of the world they didn't screening Columbus I had to go to Cincinnati to see it\nFor big movies like that I I Will sometimes do that but it always irks me if they don't screen it in my local market and we have a big university here there's no reason to not screened things in Columbus there's actually a reason why we ranked lower and it's from\nA stupid mathematical reason but\nThey'll sometimes not screened stuff and I let that go but sometimes there's movies that I ask you about and this is this was when it gets me upset and why then go on the radio unreal on this with a movie like hunter killer I couldn't find a screening for it I asked the rap I literally emailed the rap and I'm like hey\nAre you screening this in Johnny English\nAnywhere near Columbus and he said no sorry we're not\nWell then I found out that they did now I understand that there is not the budget to screen something I don't think they screen Johnny English anywhere here but they did scream hunter killer\nThe fact that they had a screening was actually kind of hidden from the ... and that really says something to me\nWhen you actually screen a movie you're showing a movie early but you refused to let press in or even let them know about it you are trying to hide something\nThere is something wrong with your movie if you're doing it just is too suspicious this isn't some movie that didn't have the budget or didn't have the interest\nIt just was hidden from its audience and it was hidden from the press and the critics\nYou're obviously worried about bad reviews you're obviously worried about I mean the thing\nIs in this day and age look gets out people know when the movie's garbage\nThey get the sense and the thing is when they show movies that like Thursday night around the country people know by friday morning if it's garbage so you'd not hiding anything so just screen the freaking movie and let let the chips fall and if you made a crappy movie that's on you\nAnyway let's talk about hunter killer really quickly us submarine commander must work a Russian plan to overthrow the world's governments from under the Arctic ice\nIn order to cross water is very [noise] we [noise]\n\nLaura minister what if we do for a car wreck the Russian President [noise]\nOr voice\nThis movie feels like it should have been made in the eighties but they just forgot forgot made and they somehow didn't release it until now I just finished the special effects\nIt starts Gerard Butler Gerard Butler about ten years ago had a really big career you know news coming off the three hundred and he was kind of a big star suddenly up and now he's not and and what his last movie was like geo storm\nAnd look I I Love Gerard Butler I think he's a who I interviewed the guy he's kind of a fun guy\nBut he doesn't quite have the same power that he used to this thing looks like he's going to suck and the fact that they didn't screen it and headed for press means to me it probably really sucks ...\nWhere we're at war you're listening in the fact that the movies with Kevin Carla suck really quickly about Johnny English strikes again bumbling spy Johnny English is brought out of retirement to stop a mastermind hacks\nMovies with Kevin Carla suck really quickly by Johnny English strikes again bumbling spy Johnny English is brought out of retirement to stop a mastermind hacking\n[noise]\nHe's having them [laughter] [noise]\n[laughter] [noise]\nThis is another\nOne that wasn't screened I don't know if they were screening it for the public but hiding it desperately from the press that I think the reason that this one wasn't screened is because these movies tend to do\nPretty terribly in the U.S the Johnny English movies I think the first one made like twenty five million and the second one didn't even make ten million\nThis one I don't think they're expecting much we're supposed to be a wider release in the theater countered when Donald like five hundred now I think they're just releasing it out of courtesy these movies tend to do very well overseas across the pond this has already made like a hundred million dollars it's a British movie and it's very dry it's even drier than standard British\nStuff that Americans like\nI'm curious to see it I kind of like the Johnny English movies I like Rowan Atkinson and I like British humor so hopefully I'll get a chance to see it it's just not today but now it has to get a preemptive suck ...\n\nYou're listening to fat guy at the movies with Kevin car let's talk really quickly about the movie mid nineties I Know he said I was going to talk about three solo in this segment but during the nineties because I don't have a trailer for a Thirteen year old skateboard or makes friends and gets into trouble while growing up in Nineteen nineties Los Angeles\nNow like I said I don't have a trailer for this and there's a reason for it it's not that they couldn't find one it's just that there's so many swear words in his trailer would sound like a conversation between our duty to be be eight it's a very foul mouth trailer because it was about Thirteen year old teenage and you know older kids\nWho are just hanging out and being friends and so just lots of F bombs lots of swear words lots of inappropriate language and this was directed by Jonah Hill and written by Jonah Hill\nAnd of course he's best known for being an actor but you know this is him stretching his directorial legs and try to do something\nDifferent than an iPod that anytime somebody try something different I applaud that\nThey make movies like this periodically every couple of years you know the all the way going back to like movies like kids or if you remember spring breakers harmony current even shows up in this movie where it's like the kids are acting inappropriate or saying inappropriate things they're doing inappropriate things or doing something that's going to trigger some people and to be like oh that's inappropriate and that's\nDangerous or whatever and the response by the filmmakers as well that's what some people do whether you're taking drugs whether you're having sex whether you're swearing whether you're using assorted language the language that is used even the swearing\nIs a a type of wearing that politically incorrect now it was very common back in the nineties overall this movie I respect what it's doing I respect what it's trying to do\nBut it is just these kids flopping around it almost feels like a documentary\nAnd while it's somewhat autobiographical it seems to be to properly Jonah Hill's light it also sort of seems like it's a bit of a teenage fantasy there are things that happened to the Thirteen year old kid that you're like yeah no one really that wouldn't happen or if it did happen it didn't happen in that context which did give me a couple I roll\nOverall it's not my kind of movie it feels a little bit like a Kevin Smith approach to movie where it's like well\nWhich did give me a couple I roll\nOverall it's not my kind of movie it feels a little bit like a Kevin Smith\nApproach to movie where it's like well everybody did it and it's like no not really just a small segment of your generation did this is just all the people you knew did this sort of weird everybody\nDid all this stuff but while this was popular in the nineties is not what everybody did I think calling at mid nineties is a little bit grand trying to capture an entire segment of a decade rather than just as very sort of narrow\nCounter cultural teenage experience which is really all it\nAnd and if you like that sort of thing and it's going to connect with you you're going to love it otherwise it's going to be a chore to watch so it just depends on where your background is I'm going to give it a kind of Iraq's just because I respect what they were doing in Iraq that segment I Need to go to a break and come back and we'll be talking about three solo\nAnd all [noise]\nIf you're a baby boomer with one hundred thousand or more of invested all assets this may be the most important in sixty seconds for your retirement

latest book from\nWell the guy's doing an interview on well you know he didn't fall from the world Trade Center 'cause he's giving an interview on the two thousands about this\nSo free solos an interesting movie is absolutely worth seeing for the daredevil nature and the and the vistas and the composition of the film or and and also to look into what kind of a person or does he sort of things and and and kind of what makes them tick\nSo I'm going to have to say that free solo rocks rocks actually [noise]\nYou're listening to a fat guy that the movies with Kevin car the next one I Want to hit really quickly is the fog\nAnd this is getting a limited re released in theaters this week and part of it's because it's John Carpenter by you know what it's been a thirty eight years since this movie came out\nSo there are there they're giving a re release and you're getting some theatrical blaming so I thought it was a good time to take a look back on John carpenter's the fog this Nineteen eighty thrillers about that sailors returning to other seaside village a hundred years after they were betrayed and it comes back to the theaters is Halloween\n... a lot earlier by white hundred years old ... long oil overall\nOne hundred years ago between midnight and water something unknown came out of the fall\n[noise]\nOne hundred years ago between midnight in one something when they came out of\n\nThis is one of carpenters movies that he made him one of his best runs of his career when you look at what he made from Halloween through\nI'm going to stay up 'til the mouth of madness and I talked about that a couple of weeks ago that was a great right now there is some thinkers in there and there are some movies that aren't as good like them or something Invisible Man I also talked about that relatively recently as a John Carpenter look back that once an okay movie it doesn't quite hold up nowadays\nBut for the most part I mean you had you had the Halloween you had the fog you had the thing you had big trouble in little China you had they live you had prince of darkness you had eventually like I said I'm Out in the mouth of madness he really loses theme in the nineties but\nGosh this is really starting his great run I mean this was a follow up the Halloween and you had a a fantastic run yet to come because two years later he's going to be doing the thing\nThe other thing I've seen about this was this was relatively early in his career at least as a star director and\nIt has a great cast with like ... and John Houseman and Janet Leigh and of course Tom Atkins is in it and and Jamie Lee Curtis and it's a creepy movie but it's a slow burn for a carpenter movie it's it's it's not a high action thrill ride it's only Ninety minutes\nBut it takes it's time to get through what it needs to do and that's a great way to follow up Halloween because Halloween was relied a lot on the fence and and you know how to has a lot of connective tissue with a with a psycho or something like that so the dog\nAlso was a special effects using the FARC look really good which was terrible when they re made it back in two thousand five or something like that so this is a this is an indelible movie and even though it's a slower bird and take the time and it has probably more characters than it needs to\nIt it's a great little horror movie and it's it's definitely worth checking out especially if you're a fan of John Carpenter or any of the actors involved\nMore character than you do it it's a great little check it out it's John governor or any of the actors and someone else to say that the ball where\nThat's what I'm going to want to come back we're going to be talking about and the home sort of around ... maximum over\n... ... you

little bit early in this segment and of course last week the ... of the weekend was Halloween that's not a big surprise that\nWasn't a big surprise everyone wasn't expecting it to do well I was seen productions in the sixties millions but it ended up winning the weekend was Seventy six million dollars which is a huge amount of money for a horror movie let alone a movie that's the series that's forty years old\nRight now stands at number one [laughter] as the highest grossing Halloween movie even topping Halloween two thousand seven the awful robs zombie remake which had are opening of like twenty six million in theaters which was considered spectacular them and if you remember back the original Halloween\nI don't know what the opening of that one was but it was pretty low I mean it's final domestic total was like just under fifty million and that's after being played for forty years so Halloween two thousand Eighteen if it was a huge huge huge\nAmount of money for a horror movie to make and this is of course that opposed it\nConjuring paranormal activity world but there's a cautionary tale to all this as much as it was cool to see a Halloween when of course he had like go down stars born and venom and goose bumps to those all you know ratcheted down in terms of top ten but Halloween take was huge\nHere's the problem though do not expect every slasher movie do not expect every Halloween movie to make\nSeventy six million dollars it's opening weekend if you do that you're a fool thing and this is what can cause a series of fall apart and this is what can cause box office to have you chase that box office it can be dangerous for you and here's exactly what will happen they'll make a Halloween too\nAnd it's not going to do as well\nAnd then they'll do another one and it also won't do as well as any other series we'll go except for something like the\nSuperhero franchises where you build this complex universe with multiple characters over multiple movies the danger of this is that they're going to expect every Halloween movie to at least make over fifty million dollars and then they're going to pull the plug as quickly as again that's what happened at the front of the thirteenth they re booted that and then they thought oh it it dropped so fast\nAnd the second weekend they said well what the the franchises dead where were you need to go back to ... I've said before the blue mouse model of making these movies for less than ten million dollars and then when it makes thirty million it's still it hit\nThe slasher craze in the eighties wasn't that these movies were making as much as the star wars movies were making is that they had a steady consistent audience that always came to the movies and watch them and that's what made those movies do so\nSo that's a big caution with this one and we're going into this we can probably hear the topic again it's going to make money and money and it made from very fast once we get outside of the Halloween frame once we're in the November it might not reading it and they don't expect Halloween from making twenty thirty million dollars a week [noise]\nWhen our heroes families need help they turn to Fisher house we\nLearned about the Fisher it out to the doctor and we are so grateful because who had three weeks to be able to kind of the hotel\nFisher houses are safe free place to save for families are moved in warriors and veteran receiving treatment that VA and military medical centers\nFisher houses and not only home it was like family family thank\nYou Fisher has thank you for helping military and veterans' families Fisher house at Fisher house dog for sometimes having family close by the heroes best medicine\nFrom the justice to heart you know the home loan studios today at twenty am north Las Vegas ...

out here that's for sure\nBut I got Larry out here and Larry first question for you is how they're doing doing great Ryan how you doing have you been wonderful excited to be out here with you all doing the show this week we have a lot of fun doing the show and talking to you our financial family out there across the airwaves\nAnd what are the things we always focus the vast majority of our time and I would say every time we get on the air and every time we can get you know in front of a group of people is really talking about income and talking about how to how to generate more income inside of the financial markets and\nOne of the things we always stress and I I Know we'll spend a lot of time on it here today is how to really get that consistent growth net consistent income in the markets\nWhether the markets are going up and whether the market's going down with other Mark Twain sideways and and that's really the the key is because there's three directions and and it's individuals were very comfortable with the buying hold kinda bullish mentality of you know we we invest into this we invest into that we hold it for a long time and hopefully when we hit retirement it's just worth or just where the heck of a whole lot more now one of the things\nIf we're going to have consistent growth in the market we can't be direction to lead dependent than what I mean by that is we can't\nOnly profit if the market goes in one direction I don't I don't know about you but one of my favorite things\nWhen I teach a half day classier it on a train economy one of my favorite things is to really work with the class and get them to viewed down markets as opportunities not just bad things you know so many times the down markets are viewed as well so bad because people are losing money and all that is true if we're just in that bullish biased as markets are going down\nWith right now is what the right skills those can be viewed as as great opportunities to make money I mean if you go back through some of the major\nCrashes that we've experienced and you can you can find the the ... of the world the pulses of the world and you can find the the word billionaire next to their name at the end of a lot of these crashes and so it's always interesting how how how maybe millions are made on the way up the billions are made on the way down\nAnd it really just boils back to consistency we want to make money we want to make money on the way up and we want to make money on the way down but what are some of the things you guys are working on what the students right now or some of the some of the new tools you and your instructor team or or or laying out there right now to help people become more consistent than less directional independent inside of the market\nWelcome back and if you're just tuning in humans Larry Jacobs director of instructor development and top instructor it online trading him he really shuts of life on consistent returns in the market one of my favorite topics though talking about consistency\nIn the market so many times I'll I'll run into different traders different investors and they've had some success\nThey've had some success in the market but they really had a hard time duplicating it and that ends up being the key really in anything that we do is how can we make money consistently how can we make money over and over and the financial markets are no different it's all about that consistent approach being able to make money is the market's going up being able to make money as the markets are going down\nAnd also being able to make money as the markets are going sideways we need to be generating income whether it's income for today or income for tomorrow in this segment we're going to spend a little bit more time\nTalking about the income side of things but whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show get excited the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners like we're talking about are are are looking to replace their income with trading investing some are looking to upgrade their lifestyles with a little additional income\nAnd and you can even call it maybe that's that supplemental side that you were talking about a few minutes ago and some are looking for this to go kind of beyond that supplemental and be their primary source of income\nAnd I've even heard people say that they're number one goal is to be able to fire their boss now now whether they're going to or not you know being in that position where you can make that call you know that starts to be that primary source of income but what are some of the key things that you guys work with students on who are looking to supplement or they're looking to even build this is the primary source of income is a great\nQuestion Ryan you know what I find with a lot of our students they first come into the academy thinking they want to make a lot of money when reality what they're looking for is freedom we've been doing this for over Twenty years we have over forty and fifty thousand students now in the academy and what we find over and over again especially coming to this class\nIs that they are really looking for freedom as I mentioned that could be they want to leave a job they don't like they want to spend more time with their families\nThey really are looking to vacation make people now are so nervous about going on vacation because they lose their jobs if they even took a day or two officer we're living in this constant stream of stress right now and what I'm finding is a lot of our students who come in thinking they want to make a lot of money\nIt's really about that freedom and it's funny or a guy named Adam was one of my students\nAnd he actually did just what you said he wanted to come in here he was miserable at work\nAnd he finally got to the point we could trade and actually go into his boss and say I have enough and I had enough think about that to be comfortable enough so if all this did right now is bring you one really profitable trade wouldn't it be worth just coming in and exploring the opportunities here\nAbsolutely just kind of checking things out and seeing what it can do for you and that whenever we talk about the happy classes whenever we talk about anything even have to have to class we always talk about risk versus reward\nAnd really specifically when you ... back to the half the class you know they have to classes or three hours long and say if you end up winning a a set of tickets to one of these you really investing three hours worth of your time and what if\nWhat if that three hours worth of your time was able to show you how you really could replace your income or how maybe you could raise your income by ... percentage so that you could have that financial freedom that Larry was just talking about that's really\nKind of the key to all this and you know what you were touching on was was the freedom site in ... and really those conversations go go fairly deep with with individuals one on one where you say you know what are you looking to accomplish this I go I Want to make an extra thousand bucks a month and that's a pretty quick conversation but then you say why ... why do you wanna make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts\nWhere you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this and uh\nYou want to make an extra thousand bucks and now that financial freedom conversation starts where you know you ... it's a it's a nice detailed process of well you know what my kids do this or I Want to do that and there's all these goals that they want to start accomplishing and part of what you need usually to accomplish those is a little more time one of the ways that helps you have a little more time is to have income coming from somewhere else having that supplemental\nSide of income you know where there's lots of different ways where we can build out the supplemental income it can be through a passive channel that could be through an active channel it can be through commodities it can be through options that could be their stocks\nBut one of the things about it is is we ... is one of these you always talk about I guess I should say Larry is is how multiple streams of income are are really kind of crucial throughout this whole process and you know the the average millionaire I think has has five or greater\nStreams of income and so when you think about like that that is that those those pieces supplementing each other if one goes away it's really no big deal you just get strategic and you build out another one now it's also one of the reasons why the the word job Jay obese stands for just over broke because if we just have one stream of income\nAnd it goes away well we're we're in her city right we're in stress city we're we're we're scrambling hopefully we've got a little bit of savings to buy as little time but it ends up being that kind of that that that downward spiral or even just stuck in that rat race so to speak of\nWell if we lose our job hopefully we have some savings we use our savings while we find another job and then we just getting another job and doesn't the cycle probably just continue\nYour building out these multiple streams of income or or something that seems to be ah not something that seems to be something that can create that nice safety net Annette nice piece of stability\nAnd you know as a sitting here thinking what you were saying and you know most people coming into the academy and you might be listening right now I'm thinking the same thing which really amazing to me it's like the story of the frog and you're gonna laugh when I say this but with the fraud\nIf you have a frog that can jump very very high but you put them in a box and you cover the box a couple of times the frog hits the top lid and even if it just that little way they still can't jump in the higher the where the lid was\nWe don't realize it subconsciously that when we get a paycheck were being defined or at least thinking or just definition of a self worth is by the paycheck that we receive\nAnd what a lot of our students really have that a ha moment is Ryan is when they start to make more money than they're making at their job so for years imagine you couldn't make any more money you've talked yourself into this is the most I can make\nAnd not only able to make more than that but you don't have to take the time away from family loved ones even things that you're really looking to do to get a second job which is taking more and more freedom away from you\nAbsolutely it always boils down to the financial freedom in doing the things we wanted to rather than the things that we have to do and what are the things we can do to help a few people get started kind of down this path really raise those skills ... raise those skill sets and start generating a little more income\nIs give away a few more these passes what he said let's do it right now we have to class coming up in your area and a half day classes where you're going to see exactly what it takes to generate more income inside of the market whether that's passive income whether that's supplemental income whether it's active income whether it's through commodities whether it's through stocks doesn't matter it's all about generating more income\nAnd we always talk about risk versus reward and your investment is three hours of your time have take classes about three hours long and now you're looking for that great warden that reward is how you could generate a better stream of income or get better rates of return in the markets\nWell in just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half their classes to get your phone's writing if you're driving now is a great time to pull

twenty we needed a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight\nNine seven four eight seven to three that's AAA eight nine seven four eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ free tablet dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nNow as we are kind of going down his income conversation we were talking about supplemental income in primary income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income what's kind of that that that that starting point what's that combined message no matter what direction down the income past somebody's looking to go to you and your instructors we like to start people\nOff with well it's funny 'cause most people don't know where to start all the time and with ... once said as you don't have to be great to start but you have to start to be great\nSo many people think that by trading they have to get rich really really quickly well I'm not at all in fact most of our instructors will tell our students is I Would it's not about quitting your job it's about finding a job that you love\nBecause if we can put our job straight out right and they were giving up one of our income streams right we don't want to do that\nBecause we're looking for multiple income streams but at the same time you've heard this expression our whole lives right don't work hard work smart\nWell that's not how people who make a lot of money I think they're not working hard they're not working smart they're learning how to work right\nAnd what working right means is they're following other people who are successful in generating money that's one of the things that are students learn how to do they learn how to make money without getting a second job because let's face it nobody out there on their deathbed going man you know I Wish I could a worked just one more day that would have been excellent now\nThey're out there saying I Want to spend more time with the things and the people that I Love and to think about it just because you're going out and setting a second job yeah you make it a couple of extra zeroes at the end of your income but if you don't have to start managing your money properly and dealing and what we call risk management\nIs going to have more zeroes on the end of your expenses so a lot of people are miserable they're out there thinking they've got to work even harder and harder with teaching students how to work right and that simply means coming in and understanding how you could create more freedom for yourself and hopefully we'll listening right now and see how could they could create more freedom\nYeah and it's all about generating that skill you know you're you're talking about people coming in and looking to make money out of the gates and just you know I Want to I Want to take this dollar and turn it into a million dollars by went by tomorrow it's like okay that's not very realistic right but so one of the things we always like to bring that up as a soda generate generating skill building the skill and the money comes after you have to have the skill first just like in any other\nBusiness than any other walk of life the skill is something that we that we really have to have first and I always tell everybody if you're looking for a big get rich quick program\nThen have to cost probably isn't for you and really the financial markets probably aren't for you and that's that's just being real because we have to generate the skills to be able to generate the income and building any skill usually isn't an overnight process it's usually something that takes a little time also said to add\nPeople out there listening if you don't have six years right now you're planning to retire\nYou don't have anything saved right now you need to figure out how to create a plan to help protect you and a lot of our students come in the door really nervous about I don't have enough money to start well you know what they're doing right it's pretty fascinating they're starting to learn how to trade\nOther asset types like futures in directly and they're saving that money from trading and they're starting to fund their retirement accounts so again a lot of people first thing they always say is like the mortgage that got the kids' college up on\nTheir retirement always comes last\nSo we start to teach her students read out of the gate that if they can come up with a plan they understand most importantly what you need is because a lot of people the one size fits all does not work when it comes to retirement\nYou can't just do this you first have to figure out what your needs are learning how to manage that need most importantly how to learn some really important risk management and how to protect that money\nAnd then at the end of the day you'll have enough to retire on based on what you need not someone else who's telling you what you need\nYou and you're talking about the kind of the cycles that the markets go through the big up from the big downs and we do generally have a crash about every and we call them crashes but we do generally have a nice big drop in the markets about every ten years\nAnd one of the things about that as you go back and look out um how often they're forty fifty sixty percent drops and so\nKind of that average that we can expect is about fifty percent if you go back into two thousand and eight and you kind of measure that you got about a fifty percent dropped ... fifty eight percent about fifty eight percent you go back into their early two thousand fifty say the same thing\nAnd so if we come to here we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal but the thing that I went through with my father about a year we had accomplished\nAnd so if we come to here and we say OK here's here that's kind of what we can expect again that's kind of the new normal but the thing that I went through with my father about ah we we had a conversation about this you know back in about two thousand and eight or you know we're talking about drops in the market we're talking about drops and accounts and and one of the things that we're we're kind of walking through was\nIf somebody had a fifty dollar if somebody had a hundred thousand dollar account and they lost fifty thousand in the last fifty percent will they lost fifty thousand so now they're account value is that fifty thousand that happened in one year\nAnd that drop happened I think it was fourteen months total rights that happened in pretty much just a year it went down\nWhen they take that average rate of return on the way up and let's just be very very generous and let's say somebody is averaging ten percent on the Web\nThat's ten years just to get back to break even 'cause when you take a hundred and you turn it into fifty to take fifty and turn it into a one hundred requires a one hundred percent return on our money and so one of the conversation we're talking about was how long does it take the average person to really even get back to break even after going through a big catastrophic drop like that\nSo one of the scariest things right now is that people just don't have a plan that don't know what to do they haven't been educated and so unless you're really sitting there thinking about this and say to yourself\nFool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me and\nAlbert Einstein had one of the greatest quotes was the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again it's amazing how many people are not willing to spend a little bit of money to get themselves educated to invest in themselves\nInstead of taking this big roller coaster ride and think about it Ryan going back to two thousand and eight if you knew when to get out of the market and locked in profit and then in two thousand nine you were sitting in cash\nIt could've been one of the greatest time of your life right now it's a little bit at three hundred percent increase since two thousand nine yet most people had no money because they lost it all in the correction\nAbsolutely one of the things we can do to help a few people really start to identify where to get in and where to get out where to protect where to grow as you get 'em out to one of the half the class is ready for a little give away let's do it right now we've got a half the class coming up in your area and a half the cost of where you can see exactly that how to generate more income how to keep that retirement account growing\nHow do I identify these turning points up down or sideways\nSo you'll know when to buy and you could know when to sell you could you could go back to the old know when to hold them know when to fold 'em type of the conversation on just a second you have a chance to win a set of passes one of these half day classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving right now is a great time to pull over including your passes is going to be our professional insiders kit that is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors\nThe professional insider kitten makes it so you can get

being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at ... ... dot com and see if you can scores and passes there\nNow Larry I always I always said everybody when and I tried to say it on the show as much as I can have two dollars or two million dollars adapted classes where you really get to see exactly what it takes to really get that money working for you and you were talking about it earlier as far as having our money working smarter for us and that's just doing the right things with our money\nYou know we've always also been talking about the market's being at all time highs and the risks that we have in there and then my dentist office I bring this up a lot on the show but it just it's so true inside of the financial markets\nThat my dentist offices a kid shout out to Dr are buckle there's a plaque on the wall and every examination room where it says\nFor don't worry about your teeth and they'll go away you know being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nHey you know what is it being that same situation here that unfortunately has been proven true time after time it's don't worry about your money don't worry about your retirement account and they'll go away\nYou know well let's just think about what people are doing right now in this moment we've been told that every two weeks is supposed to be investing in an era where some type of retirement plan which is great then nothing against that but what people are not paying attention to is where they're investing that money and for the last two years people investing all time highs\nAnd so think about it you're at an all time high\nWeek after week that's when you invest in your money and all of a sudden the market corrects will that corruption is going to impact\nThe first amount of money or the last amount of money that you basically have invested into so now you've put majority or money in the market the last two or three years when it's been higher and higher and it takes a tremendous fall and this is why we said it earlier the market falls three times fast and then it goes up\nAnd as a result people see that ... percent evaporation of wealth\nAnd that immediately at sea of seeing that freaks out now let's take it a step further\nWhen the market goes down that dramatically like it didn't two thousand eight what's next the loss of jobs the four pictures and housing dividend cuts devastating cuts all these things have a greater impact than most people believe and yet there are people out there that continue every single day to roll the dice and take a chance and say this won't happen to me\nYeah there's a huge risk out there and not a huge need for multiple streams of income and not just today but multiple streams of income throughout our life throughout every stage of our life\nTo create that stability and one of the things we can do to really help people get kind of jumped started ended his multiple streams of income lifestyle is to get 'em out one of the happy classes we still got a few passes here we can give away let's do it right now I've got to have their class going up in your area they have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes really keep that retirement account growing\nMake sure we have income for today income
