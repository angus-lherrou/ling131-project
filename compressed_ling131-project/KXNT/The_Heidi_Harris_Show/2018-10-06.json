it on the trading me\nFilling in for ... big shoes here on the income generating show now one of the things that we love to talk about here is we love to talk about making more money hence the name right we're all about income here it's all about driving more income now it always ends up being\nIncome for retirement or income for today right we can use the income for for really whatever we want but it's all about having more income so that we can do the things we want to do rather than do the things we have to do no inside of our financial markets one of the things that we stress a lot we spend a lotta time on this show\nIs how to make consistent income and that's that's one of the things I Love having Larry out here out here talking about he sheds a lot of light on that subject as far as how we can make consistent income in the market and it really starts with a consistent approaching and all we mean by consistent approach is the markets go up down and sideways so we've got to have\nA strategy we've got to have an approach that can make money off the underside was right now we've got that bullish bias where some of the greatest consumers of all time but Larry what are some of the things you and your instructor team are really having the student's focus on right now to generate money and do people identify those down opportunities and the side was opportunity\nWell it really comes out of the things it's about awareness and basically emotion right now so the ...\nIf I guess those down opportunities and the side was opportunity\nWell it really comes out of the things it's about awareness and basically emotion right now so the awareness is a lot of people want to make more money they think that making money is simply working another job which is something we don't want to do where more importantly most millionaires you and I said this over and over again to have five different income streams\nWell you could imagine a millionaire just want to go out there were five different jobs they learn how to generate income passive income or active income they just want to pay check coming over and over again and so a lot about our students learn is how to go from being very emotional\nTo being very strategic and the way you do that is by following people who are already doing what you want to do and\nWill cost referring to the big banks and so a lot of what we teach our students is\nHow the banks make money and most of the ways they make money is not just by going long where most people learn a trade that way\nBut also by going what we call shorting the market and that simply means when the markets go down it's not necessarily a negative thing\nOnline trading had I mean as taught me that he got to have a plan and they gave me the food is maybe a

academy the brains of the operation here that's for sure he was shouldn't some light on how to make money at the markets are going up down or sideways how to generate more\nMoney how to generate more income and consistent income\nNo matter which way the market is going whether you're just tuning in maybe your first time listening or maybe you've been with us for the whole show don't worry the best is yet to come and learn a lot of our listeners are looking to really replace their income with trading in investing in some of them are just looking to you know fulfill that New Year's resolution of upgrading their lifestyle with a little bit of it is of additional income\nUm you know some of them are looking just to kind of supplement things other people are really out in that situation where they want to fire their boss there's a whole the whole gamut of kind of ultimate goals that people have when it comes to generating more income but there is that one consistency between all of these groups it all boils down to another source of income we've talked a little bit about multiple streams of income passive income\nActive income and I want to use as you were saying in the last in the last segment want to spend a little bit of time kind of diving a little bit deeper into these topics and and when you guys are working with people specifically looking to to branch out their streams of income what's what's that starting point and what does that pathway kind of look like\nWell starting off with your whole idea about resolutions I mean we're coming up at that time of year Ryan we're going to start getting a barrage of videos and and ... and all this stuff about why we have to go to the gym you start seeing TV commercials\nBecause one of the biggest resolution says what losing weight the second biggest is getting out of debt and this is something that a lot of students come in now the reason why most people are poor\nP. O. R. because they're passing over opportunities repeatedly we've been talking about this in the last segment you have to make a decision right now you have to shift\nFrom worrying about how you're going to make money to being able to think beyond just survival and a lot of our students come in they don't realize is a simple step by step process of how to make money is like institutions do\nYou've mentioned this many times we talk about J. P. Morgan Chase for example this bank has only had what was it nine losing days in five years\nCrazy well a lot of people are constantly going into the markets uneducated not really understanding how the markets work and then scratch their heads when they lose money the market was designed for people to make money if you understand the rules\nSo a lot of times like anything else with a job out there people start working they spend time at a job they get better and better at it before they know what they're getting promoted they're getting to do other type of things and get more and more responsibilities what I've talked to students about the biggest concern is right now\nIs what if we have another major correction where they're going to be able to make up that income and you know it's not a question anymore of if it's when we're already starting to see reminiscent of what happened in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction\nHappen in two thousand seven or the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again we're starting to see housing prices going down again the construction industry is starting to to go down again so there are opportunities here for people to not have a situation happened to them again like it did before\nAnd I don't think anybody out there as on their deathbed going you know Ryan I Wish I could a worked another day\nYeah you know that's not the it's not the norm when it comes to New Year's resolutions it's like you know we did a big New Year's resolutions ... back in January on the show and it'll be fun to do another one this next January but one of the things that we we went through every recalls we went through the top the top ten on New Year's resolutions and and one of them was like I Hope I work like you're saying I Hope I work till the\n... to tell the day I die in ... and other ones where I Want a downgrade my lifestyle and and and and unfortunately those are those are reality is that that that a lot of people end up in but they don't need to right they don't need to end up in those situations and it really just takes a couple of small two weeks\nI I did a I did a lecture I don't even know it was it was probably eight years ago and I stumbled upon a recording of it a couple of days ago\nAnd the whole point of the lecture was about how little things become big things\nAnd so you can look at it you can look at things where you say okay well well what if I could generate a little more income and what if it was five dollars a day right and that five dollars they could turn into ten dollars a day could turn into twenty dollars and it started with that five dollars a day and next thing you know a few years from now or maybe five years from now it's five hundred dollars a day right but it had\nTo have a starting point it goes back to some of the phone calls you always throw in like ... and stuff like that were and I might messed this up so if I Do correct me with it on it but it's it's you don't have to be great to get started but you have to get started to be great right there there's all sorts of fun things like that\nThat are out there that are that are will call cliche but they're also so true right there is so true and they're they're they're they're necessary for us to say that if they're forced to hear but then they're also\nFor us to take action on if we want to generate that extra income because that's really what ends up failing in our New Year's resolutions as we say okay well I Want to make more money I Want to lose weight well there's there is a step by step process to both of those\nAnd at the end of the year the reason why maybe we didn't make more money or we didn't lose weight the reason we didn't is staring back at us in the near ... and really we've got to own that we've got to say okay I'm not going to let anything be my obstacle and especially that person in the mirror is not going to be ... obstacle\nWhich just simply means usually changing some of our habits and changing what we're doing is not a complete life overhaul but it's just adding a few more pieces and that can help it generates more income\nAnd to have to class really spend a lot of time going through some of these step by step process is that can help generate more income before you to see those you're going to need to you're going to need to have tickets so they'll let you in\nThe one of the things we could do there if you're up for it as we give away somewhere ticket let's do it All right well right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area that have their classes where you'll see exactly what it takes to start generating multiple streams of income\nIncome through stock options futures currencies right multiple streams of income\nIn just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes one of these classes so if you are driving now's the time to pull over and get that phone ready include with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top instructors lessons on topics like how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more\nThe professional insider kit makes it so you can get started right now also think you get for attending a half day class online training academy is going to give you a Kindle Fire tablet so you can access on training academy is educational information anytime you want\nColors tender twenty are going to receive to free passes to professional insiders gets one for you and one for a friend and when you attend you're going to receive that Kindle Fire tablet\nKind of a century twenty when he did a call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight\nNine seven four eight seven to three that's triple eight nine seven four eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at ... ... dot com and see if\nFor eight seven to three if you end up being a caller's nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ ... dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nThe the multiple streams of income topic is one that I Love I Love how how you can really approached the financial markets you really can't pick out commodities you could separate commodities you can separate options you can separate currencies you could separate separate a dividend strategy and very very quickly you could build out four to five six even seven\nDifferent types different streams of income\nFrom the different financial markets that we have out there and we haven't even touched on real estate or owning another business or different things like that that can be passive as well right here in the financial markets where all you really need is an Internet connection\nWe have the opportunity or we have the access of generating these multiple streams of what are some of the worst thing in multiple streams what are some of the secondary streams of some of the passive type or types of income that you see a lot of the students focusing on that are really helping them reach their financial freedom\nGoals well before I jump into that let's take a look again about just getting a second job people think by simply adding some zeroes at the end of their income\nThey're simply going to be out of debt where most of the time they don't get educated enough and they're adding more zeroes the end of their expenses so one of the ways you could look at this as as you mentioned are students realize that they can be trading and this is really about them so even if you're listening it's about you what are your goals right now what are you trying to attain\nBecause a lot of times you'll sit back that puts you at a time machine like let's say we put them back into delorean right back to the future do you go back two years and you it's made some goals for yourself how many people actually go ahead\nAnd achieve those goals probably very few and she years from now what's gonna make any different that something will change instead what if you could learn a skill that allows you to generate daily income weekly income monthly income\nAnd you don't have to spend extra hours doing it we have to call three hour traders\nThey get up in the morning when the market opens and they want to be out of their trades within a couple of hours and they got their whole day to spend with their family their friends taking vacations the key that I find is that it really is about like we've mentioned freedom\nHow are you going to find a way to ease your time to allow you to do the things that you want and the biggest single obstacle that most people have\nThat prevent them from becoming successful either financially or life is fear and so we help our students kind of get past that by really breaking this down and a simple way where students can figure for the first time how banks make money and more importantly how they can make money too\nYeah and really procrastination ends up being the largest nation in the in the world right procrastination putting things off of ... you're touching on fear there and that's what made me think about procrastination procrastination is like the result of fear\nRight it's what happens when we're afraid we just we just put it off all you know what I'm I'm fearful of this and I I Know that I Need to do it so internally we say I am going to do it just not today\nWhen really that just means we're not going to do it right so we were procrastinating we're putting it off and that helps kind of take some of the pressure off of fear but one of the things about pressure is that's how diamonds are created diamonds are created out of massive amounts of pressure and when you think about things like that great things\nAnd it simply means that if we have a correction and things continue what's to say this for all and K won't become a one oh one K. and do you have the time right now to be able to put off your retirement and still work when you thought you were going to be able to finally retirement and start living your life\nAnd the the the the the way to make money in the market hasn't changed or a thousand years we're talking about it earlier when you brought up shorting and making money as the markets are going down\nIt's always been by low so high and it will always be by low so high most of what's the probability of buying an all time highs as being you buy low opportunity right can markets go higher than they absolutely can we're taking on a lot of risk in those situations\nThere's ... there's constant pull back there's constant wholesale offerings even as the markets are going higher and over paying for things is is really what limits are potential upside and what opens up the downside for ah\nFor for risk you know we we talk a lot about the the the bullish biased and how as consumers we just usually sit there and buy everything we Bye bye Bye bye bye And right now the markets are going higher and higher and every pay the average person buys more stocks they buy stocks through their mutual funds for their for one case\nAbout through their RSP through their IRAs doesn't matter what account type it is that's ... that's the general practice kind of around the world is on pay they would just buy stocks\nWell it doesn't matter what the prices though just matters that it's payday and so we're going to invest into it now the markets are collapsing our financial advisors have a brilliant way of of of talking to us about why it's okay to continue to buy as the markets are going down\nRight a ... dollar cost averaging as the markets are going down they say by more by more by more as it's going down and then when it comes back you're going to be rich and while that math actually makes a whole lot of sense the problem ends up being is we don't stop buying when it's on its way out of all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying if these all time highs\nUp if all we did was by on its way down dollar cost averaging would be very powerful strategy\nBut when you're averaging your price back up buying it these all time highest offsets all the money that was invested in that for all and came back in two thousand nine or taking the\nAverage price up with us which which raises are risk exposure and lowers are profitability and in the end it's for one reason in my opinion my humble opinion and it's because Wall Street's businesses to sell us products and that's OK\nRight we just have to know that a Wal Mart's businesses to sell us products too and that's how they make money and I don't think they're evil right and they'll think Wall Street's evil but as the customer not client notice I use the word customer\nAs the customer we have to understand\nThat what we're what we're doing when we're when we're engaging with somebody when I go to Walmart I realize that I'm not planning on making money I'm just buying something from them and if that's the same thing that that's happening with us with Wall Street we've got a kind of take that into consideration with the\nWith the kind of analysis that we're doing on the situation are we planning on making money on this transaction if the answer is yes\nHow do we plan on making money on this and usually the answer after that unfortunately is is I don't know but that's where getting a little bit of education on how the markets work can go a long way and I say a little bit can go a long way and it really can a little bit of education\nWill put you miles in front of the average investor one of the ways where we can help you do that as we got a few more tickets so we can do a little give away as long as I said okay let's do it right now I've got to have their class coming up in your area that have take classes where you can see exactly what it takes to keep that retirement grown whether the market's going up down or sideways have more income for today and more income for tomorrow\nAnd just a second you're gonna have a chance to win a set of passes to one of these half their classes to get your phone's ready and if you are driving now is a great time to pull over\nIncluding with your passes is going to be a professional insiders kit now this kid is packed with lessons from some of our top constructors lessons on topics like enhanced the retirement strategy how to make money when the market goes down income generation capital preservation crypto currency is much much more the professional inside of it makes it so you just started right now\nI also think you get for attending to have to a class online training academy is going to give you a Kindle Fire tablet so you can access online training academy educational information anytime you want\nHow center twenty you're going to receive to free passes to professional insiders gets one for you and one for a friend in when you attend you're also going to receive that Kindle Fire tablet colors censored twenty we need you to call now and reserved those seats the number is eight eight eight\nNine seven four eight seven to three that's triple eight nine seven four eight seven to three if you end up being colors nine or Twenty one sorry about that hit us up at OJ free tablet dot com and see if you can score some passes there\nYou know we've talked a lot about the growing side of things with their retirement accounts really getting those retirement accounts to generate more incomes what about the protective side of things we've got we've got a group of people out there who have made a bunch of money as the markets have been going higher than piling money into those accounts and what can they do to protect against the downside without limiting the upside\nWell most importantly you need to understand where your risk reward rely so many people imagine if I took it back to two thousand and seven what if you learn a skill that have told you to go to cash back in December of two thousand seven and then you would have had cash in your account\nBasement bargain prices buying stock back on the way up and that's really what banks were doing they had one of the best years of their lives in two thousand eight fact I speak to our students all the time they're waiting for the next correction Wall Street has been waiting for the next correction at some point they'll be another decade long windfall coming back\nAnd it's almost like you have the opportunity here to get a nice financial do over but most people again think they know best a lot of people I talk to you don't even know what they have in their retirement accounts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you that about thirty percent of your saved retirement money\nIt counts how much they're paying fees I mean what if I told you\nThat about thirty percent of your saved retirement money is going to go out the door in fees to your brokerage company that would probably infuriates you\nSwitch you have to start doing right now is thinking well if I hadn't been able to put aside money right now learning how to trade for income enables you to start saving money what you can put toward retirement once you understand the right rate of return that you need to be able to compounded annually\nYou can start thinking about generating the money you need to retire the right way and again\nThis comes down to getting yourselves educated\nWhat I said before earlier is that most people make the greatest mistake possible try to wing it on their own by reading books are watching Youtube videos and you'll see right right I I'm not going to go on line learn how to fly a plane from a Youtube video then go up to fly in school and go watch the Youtube video can I get in the cockpit right now and take off\nDoesn't make any sense well the same thing can be said about your money as as I Love from the movie the pursuit of happiness Chris gardener mother ... portrayed by Will Smith once said the cavalry ain't come and you have to care more about your money than anybody else and that means protecting yourself by getting yourself educated as quickly as possible\nWhen whenever you whenever you bring up a the pursuit of happiness and you say to covering coming it always reminds me of another quote a and I don't know where it originated from but our our our friend Kelly would always say over and over she'd always say this life is not a dress rehearsal over\nAnd over I heard her say that a million times I don't remember where she got it from the will give you a credit for that one right now now one of the things about the fees that you were touching on that I just want to elaborate on before we jump into this break is as you were talking about thirty percent can end up going to fees and there was an article I saw a little while ago that shows how the average person spent three years of their life\nPaying for the fees so if you make fifty thousand dollars a year you can expect to be about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in fees if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you could expect to pay about three hundred thousand dollars\nIn fees one of the things you can do to avoid those fees is really take control of your your money before you should do that you need to know how to do it\nWhat great place to start that just start that educational process is out of one of our half the class and we just happen to have a stack of tickets here Larry are you ready I'm ready All right well right now we've got a half day class coming up
