until we've had the opportunity to have all of the funerals we're planning them out a starting tomorrow and then going all the way through friday uh that's where our priorities in Pittsburgh\nWe are trying to take care of the families\nAre and the victims and are coordinating our efforts around that obviously we're going to need a lot of security at those locations as well as security that's been placed at schools and synagogues and other um of our Jewish communities larger facilities\nAre and there's a lot of work that comes into planning a presidential visit\nI think that's very obvious when we see are hurricanes in situations like that generally\nGenerally unless they're playing politics they need a photo op of presidents stays away\nOr so they don't divert ah the protection a for

quickly before I let you go\nPolitics aside I I don't disagree with uh with what the mayor says that you know a lot of resources is gonna be would be used for a presidential visit but I also understand he's a political figure I Do know the rabbi from the synagogue and said the president's welcome overall what do you what are you hearing what they preferred that the president\nNot come a little bit later on but what's what's the feeling here in Pittsburgh\nWell it is a mix a you have a lot of people think you know that this is the job the controller and cheap many question whether Trump is capable of being that person you certainly tried on other occasions but he wants to come down and he's going to visit the hospital is going to visit some of the wounded first responders\nOr with whom he has shown that particular identity for the past he's also going to visit some of those who were voted in the attack uh there's another stop planted a we assume it's going to be the synagogue itself where he is you pointed out the bears\nOr or I should say the rabbi has welcomed him but the mayor's been a fierce critic of the president in the past while he's really tried to stay on the sideline here uh he he did interject himself yesterday and said perhaps it would have been better to wait\nAnd I think he uh I think he was at least a a I don't know tasteful in his in his

the law allows for house is that in any way under consideration for\nOur looking at a number of different options as I Know that the department of defense is holding a press conference this afternoon at four o'clock or to talk about some of the actions that they'll be taking I Would encourage you to that\nAnd I think you I'd rather tune in to Steve in Portland right at the White House CBS News the White House correspondent and important question or for some people may be caught in the weeds I saw some pushback yesterday from a a Ari Fleischer [laughter]\nOn a on a what you had to say with a with Sarah Sanders but I think it was an important question to\nThank you I appreciate it and are already and I had a little bit of a back and forth last night on Twitter you know he basically accused me of fear mongering by even raising the prospect but I think this morning's news\nOf the president's view of the fourteenth amendment uh once again\nRaises questions about his overall view of the power of the presidency these would be the constitution and that's the question I asked yesterday which our standards by the way didn't answer\nAnd she didn't rule out the prospect that I raised which is the idea that when you talk about invasion if you look it up and I encourage you to Google it uh the word invasion appears three times in the text of the constitution and it gives the federal government the power to repel invasions\nAnd two in in cases where a public safety is in question to suspend the writ of habeas corpus another question is whether Congress would have to act or the president could act is Abraham Lincoln acted I during the civil war\nThe ... that we are getting in the weeds here but at the bottom line is how much power does the president believes he has he has said fifty two hundred US troops down to the border for the first time in many decades\nTo fortify or otherwise uh bolster\nA hard and I guess is the phrase the military folks use ah the the ports of entry and the question is will these troops\nUm abide by the age old principal of ... which is to say that if you're in the active duty US military it's not your role it's against the law for you to enforce US law\nOf the top brass at the Pentagon insist that everything they're doing is in line with ... but if you look up that law which dates to the Eighteen seventies you'll see that there's actually a constitutional exemption for it\nSo my question of the press secretary yesterday was whether the president intends to I'm really have a very strong hand here is the executive\nUh she didn't answer it she left it open to uh she left the whole thing open and this morning the president's talking about a here to four on known power that he claims to have that he's working with the White House counsel lawn of\nEnding birthright citizenship\nIt's talking about here to four on known power that he claims to have that he's working with the White House counsel lawn of\nEnding birthright citizenship [noise] um and he says he's going to sign an executive order that it's going to happen he's working with the White House counsel that was in an interview that he would act CEOs yesterday that earlier this weekend on HBO and what we don't know exactly what this order would look like but will we do know is that when the president as a mind to act unilaterally is the executive ah\nIn some cases the Supreme Court will back him up and that's what happened earlier this year with the travel ban\nOh we are talking with CBS News the White House correspondent Steve important to you know the president wasn't doesn't approve of certain forms of immigration and yet his wife\nUh and and her parents came in on that so I'm kind of curious does this mean Baron would not be able to have citizenship here because his mom isn't from here you could say that his father was born here but I don't know if that's covered I think the president's bringing up a gray area because what's good for

our country to knit the fabric of us together to bring us back together that she'll use was to have somebody speak to our better angels as they have Lincoln called it a try and deal with is just terrible incidents that keep taking place on that rip us apart\nOn yet there's this countervailing force or in the White House to which the president wants to rouse his base and the way he says his

win the midterms or at least a sort of stunned the damage that might take place um by getting his base rouse up and making them think that he was doing things to a and illegal immigration\nBut on the

president does not seem to have it in his guts it's not even there and when it's written in a teleprompter there's always a but\n[noise] yeah and I think that's a good point because it seems like it's almost a wooden delivery when he reached the teleprompter that it's not something he means with the same passionate enjoy a and heart\nThat he he delivers his rallies where he talks about the true enemy is the American people which he says as the news media where he goes after George Soros and the Democrats\nAre and has people cheering in shanty or in a great deal of anger and resentment a and yet that contrast that with remarks that don't seem to be quite as heartfelt that seem to be just simply a sort of doing what he has to do\nRather than doing what he wants to do now that may be a complete misreading of the president and sometimes you want to be able to read those words to the way that they are carefully crafted um boat where's the emotion where's the empathy where's the feeling do you really go to a rally the night of the Pittsburgh massacre\nAnd then demonize your uh your uh opponents up I'd do it in a soft voice that just doesn't ring true to me that doesn't seem

White House correspondent Steven ... asked Sarah Sanders very important question especially as opposed to the United states is sending members of the U.S military five thousand plus down to the border for the quote unquote\nA caravan and the quote unquote invasion\nIs president talking about actually going on in the military go downstairs vision the law that allows for that is that when we're\nLooking at a number of different options as I Know that the department of defense is holding a press conference this afternoon at four o'clock or to talk about some of the actions that they'll be taking I Would encourage you to death\nI understand also by watching you and your Twitter feed Steven that you've got some pushback from Ari Fleischer from the Bush administration on this but I think it was an important question to ask Sarah\nThank you I appreciate it and are are and I had a little bit of a back and forth last night on Twitter you know he basically accused me of fear mongering by even raising the prospect but I think this morning's news\nOf the president's view of the fourteenth amendment uh once again\nRaises questions about his overall view of the power of the presidency visa v the constitution and that's the question I asked yesterday which our standard by the way didn't answer\nThat she didn't rule out the prospect that I raised which is the idea that when you talk about invasion if you look it up and I encourage you to Google it uh the word invasion appears three times in the text of the constitution and it gives the federal government the power to repel invasions\nAnd two in in cases where a public safety is in question to suspend the writ of habeas corpus another question is whether Congress would have to act or the president could act is Abraham Lincoln acted ... during the civil war\nThe ... that we are getting in the weeds here but the bottom line is how much power does the president believes he has he has said fifty two hundred US troops down to the border for the first time in many decades\nTo fortify or otherwise uh bolster a hard and I guess is the phrase the military folks use ah the the ports of entry and the question is\nWill these troops um abide by the age old\nPrincipal of ... which is to say that if you're in the active duty US military it's not your role it's against the law for you to enforce US law of the top brass at the Pentagon insist that everything they're doing is in line with ... but if you look up that law which dates to the Eighteenth seventies you'll see\nThat there's actually a constitutional exemption for it\nSo my question of the press secretary yesterday was whether the president intends to I'm really\nHave a very strong hand here is the executive uh she didn't answer it she left it open to uh she let the whole thing open and this morning the president's talking about here to four on known power that he claims to have that he's working with the White House counsel on of\nEnding birthright citizenship um and he says he's going to sign an executive order that it's going to happen he's working with the White House counsel that was an interview that he would act CEOs yesterday that earlier this weekend on HBO and what we don't know is exactly what this order would look like but will we do know is that when the president has a mind to act unilaterally is the executive\nAh in some cases the Supreme Court will back him up and that's what happened earlier this year with the travel ban\nOn we are talking with CBS News White House correspondent Steve important to you know the president wasn't a doesn't approve of certain forms of immigration and yet his wife uh and and her parents came in on that so I'm kind of curious does this mean Baron would not be able to have citizenship here because his mom or is it\nRents came in on that so I'm kind of curious does this mean Baron would not be able to uh have citizenship here because his mom or isn't from here you could say that his father was born here but I don't know if that's covered I think the president's bringing up a gray area because what's good for the goose", "show_name": "The Heidi Harris Show",
