trying to figure out how to re prioritize that and has\nA information and quality matter more and not just going to be a really tricky thing given the amount of of content that there is like you know the cat had people filtering this um and I think that's why we spend some time in the film talking about how\nMedia companies and news organizations moved on to Facebook and these other platforms and what an important thing except that was in and changing how we all get our\nNews and information um and I think we all did that rather blindly both the tech companies and the news organization but now
