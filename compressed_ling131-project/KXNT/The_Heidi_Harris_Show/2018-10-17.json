about ten minutes after take off from Andrews Air force base during base Andrews if you will outside Washington um smoke was reported on board the initial indication is that it was some kind of a communications unit or device on board the plane that overheated\nUm suffice it to say uh they they turn the plane around she has landed safely I just saw her get off the plane reporters are now being whisked away the trip is being reevaluated and I am guessing because of the fact that I'm not saying reporters are driving away and a motorcade that the trips cancelled but uh uh well we'll give you more information and we haven't\nBut she's okay nobody injured or anything like that and this and\n... and it looks like a misshapen obviously any time or that involves a either a senior government official or of course the first lady the United states a great deal attention is paid to it looks like this was a pretty minor incident no serious ah ramifications from it other than perhaps a

service agent uh did what they are not supposed to do he wasn't protecting Jared Kushner at that point he uh physically prevented a journalist from asking a question\nYeah this is this is now the subject of a formal review on the part of the secret service and we look forward to finding out what it is the secret service has to say about this because uh our colleague at the direction of management was a assigned to not to travel with Jared Kushner but just so happened that he was on the plane\nOr a delta shuttling between New York and Washington and Jared at Avon go we're on the plane and ah well the question what we would have posed to Jared Kushner senior White house official very trusted eight of the president and a friend of Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman do you believe\nMohammed bin Salman have you spoken with and recently\nUh what do you make of all this he has not spoken publicly about it he's perhaps one of the most senior government officials\nTo spoken with the Saudi crown prince and when my colleague tried to ask the question is Secret Service agent got in his face moved his arm away 'cause he was trying to record it with his phone and said some of the effective I don't give a damn who you are there's a time and place\nWe're still waiting to know what time and place is the right time and place to ask Jared Kushner question he's not very often available\nAnd again this is not what the Secret Service is supposed to do it is not their job there had been plenty of situations where their protect these have been asked questions when they didn't want to answer questions and\nThe secret service no better at least experienced ones the trained ones now that that is not their job and I'd like to get an update on that if we can get that from your
