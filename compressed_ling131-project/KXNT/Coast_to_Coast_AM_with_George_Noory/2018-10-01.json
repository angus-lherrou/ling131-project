will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment\nFresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve a David joins me in just a few minutes and we will jump right into it for those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence in cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly\nTaken a by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first but worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered him didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background ought to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal lead train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any list and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks and jurisdictions\nAnd uh we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues to ... refiled and they came back an attorney called the Simon said why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you and they said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said wow research and then he came back and he said well we don't have any listened missing people\nAnd I said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or accumulate list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nSaid no we don't have any less so years ago somebody said well David you ought to just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper at Yosemite National park I bet they have that inventory list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well I'm a printed author so I Want to use my author status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together a list I Want to list from Yosemite and I went to was from the national Park Service and they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire\nSystem and I can't\nYou how many people since I first said that years ago I have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting less from their entire system because we still say they don't have it and I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards and every parking every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and make it higher\nThe summer that can scream the monthly reports to come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now of course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it but as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes them they say that the list exists\nWell a ...\nIf they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exist um\nYou know it it's it's pretty clear they don't want to cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it in a night we're going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind it\nUp or those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people you're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things start jumping out at you\nAnd when I went through my third three hundred four hundred five hundred read reports start making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine strip search and rescue they can't I Can't find a scent and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked in a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about a Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time to train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there a bad reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot the turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change weather event\nIf the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times\nThe time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time it's three four five PM many of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can't explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this\nEither the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water boulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anywhere in the world but granted plays much more of a role as I explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them\nAt that point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the ...\nAlmost like something's watching and when you split off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment malfunction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with these searches and then people talk about other equipment there are other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and have never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared but isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in specific profiled that I just laid out here\nAnd there is a this geographical crushed during that I figured out why after I started putting Ken's at a U.S map Mr to track this years ago\nRight now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada now there are other locations in Lebanon other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening\nA lot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book started to get rolling and people are different parts of the world right um [noise] they say hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd\nBe surprised how this fits into this little niche\nUm and it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and it's men to women is a four to one ratio correct I\nAny idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors in out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they raised the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\nAll right I'm not for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because then that information becomes key to you picking the cases that huge zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I are huge database and I would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times times they want there was a case from eighty six\nI'm an error the girl's name was Eris she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspects there's no crime why can't I see it um and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against the law to go missing\nIf you wanna fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's gonna emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you somebody but these people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lot of times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why they want us to see it\nBut there's this I called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access now in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to\nTrust Colorado has that laws well sort of like the freedom of Information Act a law\nBut many states don't and law enforcement knows and they won't give up anything um so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say the storage you can't trust the media\nBecause I Would say eighty percent of the time when I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened\nAnd I like to think back Thirty years ago forty years ago when there were reporters that really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information\nBecause it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case you\nKnow like outside of Las Vegas and then a couple that you and I've talked about before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there was a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of the scene I'm who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you you defer to them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to know the full story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain\nYou know makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have an a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks\nHeart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking about nature those people have no idea what's going on\nIt's the people at the top tier in the government that are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated\nAnd it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff it's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it\nI Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when a sheriff's office help on a search\nAnd they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... well I wasn't supposed to get that\nBut then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases uh you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle she'd like to go to this a location a called ... per ... V. E. S. P. E.

I don't even know how somebody wanted me to get to talk to the mom and the mom and I communicated and I kinda gave them this road map\nAnd it's the same thing I've said is that you've got to get these reports otherwise you're just going to be replicating that exact same effort that search and rescue stung before not a lot of instances that may turn some results because\nPeople are found in areas that have been previous research that is true but if they have a lot of area where they say that they haven't searched very thoroughly and the state that on the reports which they do and that Syria you really want to give it a big push\nBut the mom told me that they weren't getting any cooperation from the sheriff the sheriff wouldn't get many reports the search and rescue people weren't given him any reports and they were getting frustrated now this is the same thing I tell every family and if there's one listening out there is this what you have to do\nYou don't go to the local news media and so you'll understand this George\nIs the local news media has to deal with the sheriff in that county day in and day out for the rest of their lives they can't burn a bridge they can't get 'em irritated they have to live with them but the national bureaus Fox CBS NBC CBS the national bureaus you want to get one of those people in there\nTo learn more visit PBA dog who were in service of paralyzed veterans of America\nTwenty three million veterans there she wrote need our help when our heroes families need help me turn to Fisher house a safe free place to stay steps away from their loved ones hospital do doping military and veterans' families Fisher house at Fisher house dog for\nFor ... for news succeed forty AM Jay accent tea is at our website it can't send jeep Josh ya flash rule\nFrom the justice to heart ... studios Jay intend ti a north Las Vegas ...

where his head was that he knew he was he was going to be a doctor when he grew up you graduated from Albion College with a ... biology degree five data cap is soon become loud it\nWas accepted at Wayne State medical school first year medical school he was granted an internship to the Mayo Clinic in June of Nineteen Ninety nine at the end of a second year going into his third year he took his first vacation in eight years\nAnd he traveled to Oregon to check into some possible residency and so he was kind of mixing business with pleasure\nUntil the family wanted to see some wildlife\nMother told her son at the time never to hike alone\nPlease don't do that Steven\nOn June nineteenth you flew into Portland international airport got a vehicle from rent Iraq a Chevrolet Cavalier drove to Portland youth hostels checked in and paid cash for Thirteen nights I'm sort of paid Thirteen\nNights with his credit card now law enforcement reports state on June twentieth Steven called his parents on their on his borrowed cell phone from them\nSaid he had arrived all was well checked in things were great manager of the hotel said Steven usually left before the others look he was last seen on June twenty second or the twenty third and he was seen at night and a suit saying that the residency interviews had gone really well and he was happy\nOr June twenty second he drove his vehicle from the hostile to the salmon Huckleberry wilderness twenty five miles southeast to Portland and completed the trail permit to enter the same and view wilderness\nAnd they stop people here right now and tell you that you may think that when you complete those trail permits and put them in that little metal box that somebody's reading those and it's going to follow up and make sure that you come out\nThose trail permits are never reviewed and they're only used to see the load of people on the trail there never checked to see if you came out there are ... worthless some don't ever count on those\nBut on June twenty third a pair of hikers\n... Stevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early well they executed the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and it bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff\nAnd a deputy came out Rand registration on Iran or Iraq and the vehicle came back registered to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left\nWe're supposed to return to trade on July second the parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive they called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person [noise]\n[noise] so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland and the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and a theme that some assistance from the national guard Kenya and since our teams\nSearchers face rain and wet conditions for many of the days\nBut again the searched and start for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praised the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey said that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything can Deborah dogs were later put into that area I never picked up ... percent they ah they had a psychic approach them\nAnd the psychic went with them and some for service people down the trail the Cambridge switch back look down the cliff they saw little T. P. structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died search and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and the second city needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever found there\nAnd they are hoping understood that they are now any communications with the sheriff and yours none ever with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting search was two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol turned her when she disappeared in her park she at least left left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I said is it every conference and I say it on every time on 'em on with you people need to carry a personal located beacon cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there's no monthly service feet and get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately they'll find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nWell a lot of things went wrong in this case a just a comedy of errors it's not very to meet you know I mean but I you know search that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nI don't think you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack with them I doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen yeah I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can just ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nMentioned about the psychic they got involved in this case have you ever employed the services of a psychic or have you ever invest the ended ... worse like it was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nTell your story is um there's a remote viewer who's on coast to coast fairly frequently you will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people\nAnd ask them if he had ever found anybody and he gave me the name of this person and I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to him I contacted this victims wife I said hey did this person help you in finding your husband\nShe goes he didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind and I will use anybody when somebody lies to me I won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and in other remote viewing cases there was one guy at a conference with a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible now there's another guy who's a remote viewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better but as far psychics\nI did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychic own this role at a this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this road introduced myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said\nYeah yeah yeah we want to help won't help for sure yeah we could do this I email each one of them the next week when I got back and I never got a response from whatever\nWe're talking with ... just about his newest book missing for one one land air or water Mardi Palan a pioneer of the San Francisco rock scene died at the age of Seventy six this past week here's a one of his best\nYou had a great job using auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California and it was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who's a very diligent guy always on time very respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the club early they laugh\nEarly on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location and friendly at the super gas station or a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears corrupt pocket dialed his wife while she was asleep and California and left the link the voicemail strange sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human sounds or their animal sounds or what RV\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on this includes um some of the clips from that phone call so maybe we can play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\n[laughter] it's a voice mail unlike anything you've ever heard before [noise]\nThere were two minutes worth of noise in the yard one [noise]\nVery little actual talking that's the only concern did disturb me neither one of the night call came from

police chief tells me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and voices for clues did she says the investigation deputy here on Tuesday\n[noise] right see\nYou you and say late all areas where Medicaid was recording the cell phone ... skin sense of unity why does this whole series they have nothing in case\nSo that's a news report from Minneapolis television station or she the reporter mentioned in that report did that or the FBI was analyzing it to police were trying to make some sense of it have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it claimed up so tight but one thing that I've written about in past books\nIs that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for the F the FBI to be involved in this it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it why is the FBI sticking their noses in this\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason\nNow the last tower\nThat they pick up that phone was near Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east of the Mississippi River\nIn many of the cases I've written about in the past in missing for one and one is sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy men that were found in bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he would be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canines helicopters ground teams everything\nOn November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon\nA kayaker was on Russia lake one mile south east of the last time they can that phone and they saw body in the water and they recovered it\nThere was no violence at all to the body according to the corner the determination on the count on the cause of death was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McCabe in the water\nNow one of the things that I presented in sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men was that many times the families did not accept the determination by the corner on the cause of death and they paid for secondary autopsy several\nTimes when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of G. H. B. in the system of the victim and they were in level so high it didn't make sense so GHB is commonly known as that date rape drug people\nGet it they pass out\nRealize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never has any of their friends relatives et cetera seen the point where they disappeared sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B canines couldn't track point to point a lot of times it happened in the winter and there was no marks in the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a a bank of snow\nYou would die from hypothermia you wouldn't die from GHB intoxication if they placed you on the water you would die by drowning knock from G. H. B. and C. G. H. B. is not one of the twenty\nDrugs that are screened routinely by corners across the United states\nIt's only caught if you pay an extra them out to do this much more advanced screening for drugs\nAnd so it's a very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases but it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat are recording it certainly seems like a he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony and then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody on there that says stop it that's um that's that's a that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is in in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street\nHe's on the phone with a girlfriend that has its says where are you I Need you here now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing in his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found so these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different\nBut when you listen to the incident as it evolves\nIt's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies were found and sometimes they aren't and they're they're just like snatched by persons unknown by things unknown almost like no gigantic bird is swooping down and snatching them up\nUm you know so many\n... agrees is calling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about this or I heard you on this YouTube say this\nIs I don't say that and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic because I'm not giving you any theories I'm giving you All Facts\nAnd that's the way I Want people to understand is is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes were linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\nThat there are patterns say and um this book I wouldn't think that you'd have cases in the air um uh that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of 'em in the end it starts with looking at triangles including one that's here in Nevada right\n...

some of that work is being done right now\nAnyway it's uh it it was a it struck me as a significant that the person who told me that in D.C had brought them your books and and\nYour subject matter I Want to try to get one more of these air disappearances in before the bottom of the break because I'm I think I'm going to open up the phone lines are no people are going to want to talk to you a little bit the Scotland cases guide Norman Peter Gibbs could you summarize that one\nSure I'd separate twenty fourth Nineteen Seventy five nine thirty\nI went to a mall it's an island in Scotland he's fifty five years old I Gibbs was a war hero he was an intellect and he was a pilot we spit fires in the battle of Britain in Nineteen forty\nHe was staying at a place called the Glenn force a hotel and it sat right on the ocean northeast side of the island a mall and there was a graph airstrip there and the rooms were right next to the airfield looking at the water [noise]\nHe arrived at the hotel on December twenty if on December twenty thirty contacted the owner of a Cessna one fifty parked at the script and asked if he could fly it\nIn Hamilton was the attorney negotiated a price to fly the two seater and on Christmas Eve Nineteen Seventy five at nine thirty Gibbs walked out to the plane with a hotel guests named Felicity Granger\nAnd she thought she was going to go with him on a flight but he told her no she had to lay off the torches suit you could fly inland so\nShe exits the plane\nPlaces the torches out in the field and he or she sees him taking off the plane flying out over the water\nNow some reports say that after he took off they saw strange lights on the water some people said it might have been a fishing boat but they could never identified the boat and they could never see where the lights went\nWill make a long story short Gibbs didn't return on the plane and there was a major search on and off the island for days and they found nothing and they found a sheep herders and ranchers that search all their property they got nothing\nWell on April twenty first Nineteen Seventy six it was about four months after the disappearance\nGives his body is found on the north pole\nAnd this is an amount and it's like an oil near the airfield and he has a small scratch on his chin nothing else and a shepherd took part in the original search and he walked by the spot where the body was found multiple times and never saw it\nNow if gives it jumped from the airplane there should have been more injuries and broken bones\nAnd they never found the plane nothing physically was wrong with him so he could walk back to the hotel the best everyone could tell\nThe corners stated the cause of death was exposure meaning hypothermia\nAnd he gets that he probably died two hours after takeoff will they examine his clothing and there was no salt or marine organisms on the body that means he didn't go into the ocean and crawl out unanswered questions were is what were the lights on the water\nReally how did you get there\nReally how long has he been dead where was the plane and then my notes on this I write down GHB again because there's no reason for a man to die of exposure on the top of a mountain\nWhen people get cold they get up and they walk you don't lay down and die obviously the top of a mountainous colder than the bottom or where you could see humanity from the top of this mountain strange case\nYou know I've seen a some people respond to some of your cases that the weird ones where the clothing is missing and I've seen people trying to explain in a way of saying people do weird things when hypothermia sense and they'll take off their clothes and and walk into snow and and do things that seem logical I'm\n... now would you respond to those kinds of ah remarks and what did it here\nIf I look for cases that are insurmountable meaning that explanation doesn't fit I have several cases where somebody leaves the house and within a hundred yards of the house they find a pile of close\nAnd personal left the house and it was Seventy degrees out later that night it got down to fifty but the person who left the house and in a hundred yards all their clothes is gone and they're in a stack in the field is is happened multiple times\nAlso I've had other cases where a parent as my baby couldn't take off their clothes\nSo if somebody saying they remove their clothes and they died hypothermia good luck with that because the kid couldn't take off their clothes\nSo the cases I Try to include tried I tried to explain this rationally\nNow there's a group out there that don't want to understand this and they want to explain it away with the book you kind of stuff and that's fine but the reality of it is is that there's there's usually no rational explanation for why this stuff happens\nYou know in the alien abductions deal I don't know if you've read any of that there are some cases that are almost humorous or that we're there'll be somebody who's taken\nBy some entities and they come back in their clothes run backwards or she was missing or I'm against somebody else's underwear on a or they're rare cases where multiple people say they're taken and their clothing is switched when they wake up in the morning\nI'm no there can be all kinds of explanations for why people take their clothes off\nA that don't involve aliens but it it reminded me of some of the cases that you have in your books where people's clothing is found its kinda folded up it's a it's neatly placed somewhere away from people and um it's not torn up as a by bears or something it's just weird\nI've written of cases in this book and other books were special notes were made that the clothing and the body was impeccably clean like it just came out of a laundromat and the body just came out of a shower\nAnd they couldn't explain why everything was so clean\nAnd you have cases where bodies or kids are found they'd been missing for a couple of days they've been in the wilderness no food or water and there's not they're not really they they're not whether there is not like they've they've been out in the in the open up for very long at all\nCorrect so where are they where did they go well the same thing applies to the water\nRelated cases when when the bodies in the water is just certain things that we know certain things to the hair loss of hair rink ring of body fingernails things like that and when these bodies were pulled out\nCorners of made statements that well the person disappeared on Monday but they've only been in the water for twenty four hours but they've been gone for six days it's a worthy wherever they then for all this time and that's the importance of behind finding a body especially water\nBecause it shows things that it wouldn't show otherwise\nIt's almost like it's a ... or all harvesting that whoever whomever or or whatever is taking people it needs something from them unless it's just malicious it needs something from 'em and and some\n... ah some of these people never come back in ... and some are just disregarded or when they're not needed anymore um I mean I I Know you're reluctant to go that far but it that's ... what it feels like\nOne of the questions I get all the time is are these people ever found to be abused\nThings missing from the body not the case if they are found ... pretty much intact without a lot of injury to him I mean one of the things that people with federal why is it will do what they're doing is they're all\nWell I mean I don't know how you measure that\nI don't either\nBut I've heard those kinds of allegations of uh what some other intelligence what their interest in us might be it's it's a tough one to prove I don't know what it would take for you\nWhat kind of evidence that would take for you to reach a conclusion I guess it would take maybe film or video of of one of these uh incidents under way\nWe were when we first started this trip together years ago\nPeople said oh he knows what it is you know it right gotta be something mundane it may be some crypto topic that he just doesn't want to talk about\nCome a long way and I think if you start shut the door to early you can't really what may be obvious years later and that's one of the reasons I've been reluctant to say\nAnything that you know maybe a possibility 'cause it may close that door for me I mean I think where we are today versus where I was six years ago right huge difference\nI'm with a friend of mine and uh she fits all the criteria she had you know our piece shut 'em so she had a medical tedious anything she's expert hiker is granted it's in it's in granite falls granite boulders creeks and rivers you have to cross through the creek is that\nUm [noise] anyhow um when we went um he came back out of the mountain um you met up with a couple of other um searches and\nI'm One gentleman had found some future panties 'em and they tried calling the nine one one non emergency number and you tell a search and rescue and they never called back\nUm and another lady um they were and that generally smelled decaying flesh at certain points um yeah and they they tracked it down their phones they could give him a\nUm you know I I don't know ... and it was three teams on his cell phone into an excuse me one of them didn't make any sense way off to the left or the or\nWhere you park your car it's not even with the trail is um anyhow um and just kind of thinking you know I've started what this could be and I was thinking maybe portals to another dimension\nUm big foot big slipped my the guy who was within his brother had seen big foot a couple of times up in that um family and I've seen a shift it's twenty five feet above me\nHe is also an underground\nSecret naval base on their own land strange enough um it's on the back side of the mountain that Jim creek I'm at only ten and I don't know any it could have anything to do in this case or not but it's just they're all kind of strange things that you've been mentioning\nThat phone call you guys had sounded like a big but it was like a big fight before\nWell do you know we're going to get Dave to react to you dropped a lot of snow on us there and we'll get deems reaction to some of that I mean all those ideas have been proposed before I I'm I suspect that he's going to tell us that

call what's on your mind\nQuestions for David said you've talked about how uh people when they have come they haven't remembered anything that's happened to them so I wondered if you've looked into perhaps there are people witnessing is it that but there's something about having their memory a race that\nAlso you've talked about the German connection so I wondered if you've ever looked into mysterious disappear\nUm if they're\nSo German Germany is tough I I don't speak German I I don't have a contact in Germany there are a couple of people who have purchased the books that have read and I've never gotten anything back out of Germany indicating that it's more prevalent there than not\nWhat about the mines being a race or you have written about about problems that people have been remembering where they've been\nCorrect and uh that's an obstacle especially with kids that's a touchy one uh I don't think that many parents want their children to go through any regression hypnosis to try to figure out what happened because they probably want their kids to keep that memory suppressed\nNow parents adults that might be a different idea might be something to look into if there happens to be somebody that will have the claims that and is willing to those are a lot of water hurdles right there\nYou have some cases where kids are taken they're very young and their explanations are pretty weird so no one takes them seriously about you know I was taken away by the big talking mayor or something along those lines right\nYeah those are those are hard to explain and you know a lot of people a reporter wall put in the article you know that's just the kids imagination the search for set\nWell is it or is it not\nOn the wild card line Carolyn North Carolina hello Carol\nMy I

author of community along right\nYeah that that had some some real interesting things as far as cooking and it's been brought up to me before that there's some belief out there that special forces have that ability and they practice it when they're in the woods who knows if it's true and who knows if they do it but I've heard that before\nBut no indication that the there is some kind of nanotechnology involved than any of these disappearances based on marks on the body that you've heard of\nSomeone quarters do an autopsy they look for the marks that's one of the things that could be

David might want to talk to you and I appreciate calling in and sharing that with us\nWe're going west of the Rockies Roger in Bellevue, Washington Hi Roger\nAnd it's a thank you George I'm missing out um I wanted to a related story to Mr polite as a\nAbout a missing people are in the Bellingham uh area of the Washington state\nUh that uh over several years at least a recent and in the past uh have turned up missing a and a later on some of their body part and mainly their feet have shown up in the uh\nIn a water are in different areas and ah [noise] and since the during that time period or my wife and I had a\nHad the misfortune of having a miss a missing son and he was a very well trained a boy scout and uh we figured that uh you know that uh since it's been two years now\nThat uh [noise] you know it's a well nothing ... nothing has turned up in terms of evidence or anything like that so the uh the local law enforcement closed the case and ah and because he's an adult we can't go forward with it because of his wife\nAnd a and so we're we've been kind of stuck with that but I wanted to find out if I'm Mr apply to says are being aware of this a phenomenon of uh\nOf defeat a issue and uh it's it's been a well publicized and newspapers and hand over there\nKnow what I mean I'm sure you've heard of that and uh you you know if you wanted to try to contact them we have a we have links on the coast to coast webs ideas\nYeah I'm missing dot com that's where you reach a game I I Know he knows about the defeat story because it was a widely publicized but your son I'm One of the circumstances where did that happen and when\n[noise] okay uh if it happened in Bellingham and it happened or just on the outskirts of town and a ... basically what happened uh it and this happened two years ago October uh he uh\nHe had left home and uh we believe that maybe there may have been uh\nSome friction at home but uh he has left home and he got his vehicle and evidently it ran out of gas in a can didn't have any money to get gas so he took up walking\nAnd it was nightfall at the time and he tried to call him and his wife back in a that was the last that they had heard from him a ... when he had stated that his phone was dying and he was lost and lost in the woods somewhere\nAnd couldn't find its way out and uh and and then we had a a massive search uh for the next two days in a row with uh with uh the law enforcement we also had a\nHad helicopters they had dogs they had a drones uh I'm In their cupboard a area over ten mile stretch and nothing at all showdown\nPeriod and ah we were just show a broken over that uh and uh\nAnd since then I have actually personally myself I have called in and talked to a few times to some of the people that they actually investigated on it\nAnd they just basically told me that uh that they were a a ... ... they were basically are held by the laws of the state in and of course the the wife uh\nUh that uh any information given out the would be specifically only given to her and uh and that the parents couldn't find out anything you know after that so well under that reason why yeah I'd like\nTo try to uh maybe a get a shot at a you know talking to David I'm is brightest and she would uh see what he thinks\nI I Would just you try that website are okay but that is but also you can leave your name and number with Donna and uh I'll pass on to Dave I'm that's a\nThat's a rough story to to tell on the radio I'm sure I thank you for sharing it with us and you know I can imagine that that's a whole it never goes away and the fact that you just don't know it was just a is brutal\nA thank you Roger thanks for calling in will try to get one more call in before we go to a break a Joe in Long Island on the east of the Rockies Bonnie Hi Joe Hi\nGeorge ah I did a couple of seasonal gigs to national parks a glacier and Denali in Alaska and one thing I Would say uh especially looking at an alley the infrastructure of the park is very limited\nUh they have like a road that goes to mount McKinley that ... is winding mountain road that bus it can take a bus\nNo real hiking trails and if you go off the uh those roads like the flooding would be bad for hiking so\nI I Would say it and I will call late this glacier ah they really on the plight shows how treacherous a trail could be for example and glaciers\nOn actual trials that are like twenty miles trails for like two three four miles\nSo I I think a lot can do wrong uh and uh you know if someone was like fake by themselves and they hurt their ankle and cutting for feed\nA that I don't know anything could happen what the wild animals the one thing now I don't think\nAh what's happening as some sort of Charles ... group that are looking to just find isolated hikers and do something with them I never really got the impression although I read that like criminals with hideout Yellowstone for example I don't think\nThat people go to those parks to like\nA just a pounce on someone that's an isolated hiker fell I I I I Would speculate that that's not what ... what is happening\nUh but uh I I think what David Sanger without that national parks is very little supervision people are\nAre you know are just off on their own toward the gray and I've done that including myself or any number of times where something happened on the trial a nobody would have no where I was ... and one more thing on that is my ... theory is what you said about the birds\nA swooping down I did see a Glacier National park like these tiny birds but they almost right on the ground I for one says it looked like something from traffic park\nSo I Do wonder if that's about right there is some sort of ... historic bird that might be out there but that's my coast to coast theory\nI'm you know the idea that they are criminals and national parks national forest I think that's probably true you know there are criminals pretty much everywhere that humans go uh in addition you have a lot of people who uh grow and grow weed out there in in the\nWilderness places and uh and would do anything to protect it and um\nYou know but those kinds of cases are generally weeded out of the David database if we're talking about people who banish I'm under very strange and specific kinds of circumstances\nAnd there is no tracks there was no indication that people are around a ... they can vanish within a few feet or their family members or the people or hiking with so it's very weird and I don't think that uh criminals being out there could explain\nPretty much any of the cases that are a boiled down and David books but a appreciate that thought oh we're going to take a break now and there's a lot of folks on the phone lines or we'll get to as many of your calls as we can I noticed that a couple of folks have their own stories with the encounters strange encounters in the woods and\nYou know it's been a while since I've been a hiking out in in the wilderness areas but um but I can understand how the elements skin and sort of close in on you a little bit and uh it gets pretty creepy out there sometimes the um we're going to go to the break the shell and taste take us into the break and we'll be right back\n[noise]\nAnd he had all these white back for like the wrong way raptor and there was like strange noises stuff of like a greyhound\nOf fate is walking on both parts later on a couple of weeks later or if you got to say something and it never was ever nothing was ever said if I ever again you know anything about that or\nI don't know anything about that specific creature or creature report but I Do know that the ... I'm a I'm area has been a hotbed for really weird stuff rubbery long time\nOr the guys who investigated the skin Walker phenomena Utah spent some time on the ground up there collecting information and stories rumble locals including the tribe\nAnd had reported the number of different kinds of creatures it's always been a UFO hotspot or at least for the last ... years so there's a lot of weird stuff concentrated in the area you're discussing uh but no I hadn't heard the story about the\nThe um things pulling people out of their sleeping bags at room rock lake thanks for sharing that do appreciate it we're going to go east of the Rockies to Roy in Youngstown, Ohio morning Roy\nDoing All right what's on your mind\nA um I remember um this evening are you guys were talking about David Paterson or you were talking about ... right and uh\nAnd I literally stood up and said that and I pointed at the radio because I read all the books I've read all the full on what books of a red ... rash book\nAnd I've been following this thing for some time for several years or\nWhen you guys were talking about that all kinds of things to come to mind\nRich lived a certain number of disappearances\nAre a lot of disappearances happened on or near rich line and I just couldn't walk her ranch that's on a ridge line\nUh let's see uh a hundred percent success rate every time an individual is taken no one ever see them being taken\nOver the skin Walker ranch we're dealing with with with something that is highly intelligent and no one ever ... somebody's on the property or on around I mean it's just to me I I'm just saying to me a ad in my opinion I think that you know the the skin walking ranch uh\nIs very close to uh the the phenomenon surrounding the Fort one one\nWell I you know I think there are some similarities in it then it is whatever it is it seems to be intelligent and it seems to know what people are doing before they do with themselves and it's still the that's for sure the only difference is there at skin Walker to my knowledge no one has disappeared animals have been other here but not people\nYou know there has not been any people are saying but there has been a you know yeah I mean that's the other side that we have had animals missing but then we've also had mutilation\nYou know the thing that doesn't that there would be that ah when people have gone missing there's been no explanation of the um gouge marks on them other than scrapes and things like that no no kind of like ... or something of an alien would do when you read a dachshund stories and things like that\nThat that that doesn't fit but as far as rich lines go on and uh and the high intelligent or is it a hundred percent success rate a no one ever sees sees it ah that that to me is uh some good strong Marcia but\n... thinks thanks for sharing your impressions with is that's a lot to chew on appreciate your calling in we're going to go to a wildcard line Mario in San Antonio in Texas or he has a sliding he wants to tell us about welcome\nWelcome jurors are eight a ticket for taking my call I wanted to be my\nExperience or this year and a Parkinson's on your own which they added another channel miles up bike trail connect a couple of parks\nAnd found is wooded area where even do was daylight at the time almost literally me and my wife were using up by slowing down to chart a course I was a little ahead of her and uh we got through this one area where it got kind of dark even though it was daylight but it was so would it that it was\nThe sun sunlight shining through as much as I started kind of got kind of dark in that area and when I stopped to see what my wife was that I noticed some kind of something just staring at it and it was like on on the stump they look more like a bird\nOut but ah you know we never know I mean they kind of felt like it was like seven feet tall ... feet\nAnd just and then on the stump just a staring at me and my wife when she approached a mean looking at something she those and we've kind of look kind of stunned that each other and I said did you see that and she's like yeah\nSo when they saw was just awesome we just saw it back there'll be flying away but the wingspan was so large it was a\nIt was like a regular bird you know what I mean we have dogs and I'm ... and all kinds of stuff but not in a park nearby but this is a real heavy area would it\nBetween parks where they had made a bike trail and that's all it is and so I just wanted to share my story 'cause I Know we didn't report it to know posture or any park rangers anything\nEvidence is too it's kinda hard to believe that there could be that big and we were just two people just light invites than a a [noise] a lie down some kind of report about something that we just saw\nSo a ... you said this thing is seven feet tall did it have just like a regular bird's face or or do you remember what coloring on this animal is\nAll you saw was kind of like uh maybe it's something ... his eyes colleague long just like if you just see a beer in the dark flow war or something like that you knew staring at you but you you can just see us up like a form of shape\nBut you could really judge exact details especially when there was that this that and I think the first thing you know I Know what it was a sense that something was staring at me and that's why that sort of made me look and\nWe're not going to cut my wife and I'm looking at it and I look at that point so I so second\nShe turned around and just try to fly away so I could ever really feel bad like hands arms of the detail all I knew it was huge because we used to have chickens and and do stuff like that it was nothing like that\nA Mario thanks for sharing that story nothing none of that's kind of creepy stuff where she ate the specific detail that you had on that uh wow that's quite an experience uh Jason in Portland, Oregon as inexperienced to share with us Asian welcome\nFlowed George it's an honor to talk to you I'm always nervous when I call in [laughter]\nNo need your you're among friends what's on your mind\nThank you very much um I had an encounter way up in the woods and I've had

so the facts are I'm going I'm hiking into one of my favorite little fishing lakes\n[noise] that's basically off of an old logging road\nWell when the forest service closes a logging road what they do in this logging road had been closed for a long time they bring in a major excavator and they dig a huge trench on both ends of the logging road\nAnd pile up a big mountain of the debris and boulders and things like that so it's impossible to drive a car or any vehicle down that road again\nYou can kinda hike around it and even at times on your own two feet that can be very difficult because it's heavily wooded dishes in the coast range and it's basically rain forest a terrain [noise]\nSo I'm walking down the trail and I ...

A. W. land air and water and it's jam packed with odd spooky raise the hair on the back of your neck true life stories of people who simply vanished as if into thin air\nThe circumstances in each of these cases are very specific to a pattern that was discovered by Dave and up by now\nHe's looked at thousands of these disappearances and some patterns have emerged on land around ... water and as we will hear tonight in the air as well so this evening we will hear the latest including a few cases that are ongoing at this moment fresh mysteries that maybe you can help solve\nA David joins me and just a few minutes and we will jump right into it but those who do not familiar with the mystery we'll start with a refresher on the characteristics that make these particular cases stand out from a standard case of somebody who just gets lost in the woods or wilderness goes way beyond that\nAnd we will spend the next three hours talking about new evidence in cases he uncovered and then the last hour tonight I'm not sure what we're going to do I I think I'd like to hear from listeners your ideas about what's going on here why some people are seemingly\nTaken a by whom\nAnd whether we will ever be able to resolve this so put your thinking caps on and be ready to jump into the discussion in our for also tried to save some time for you to interact with Dave as well in our three\nOne news note here in Las Vegas we're on the eve of a somber remembrance one year ago October first but worst mass murder incident in American history unfold fifty eight people were gunned down that an outdoor concert on the strip hundreds were wounded or injured\nKind of clear over the big picture that they don't want to help solve these mysteries\nYou know it it's a sad note on humanity if that's the case but there is a lot of obstruction so when I started out I was told by a couple of Park Service rangers that they had found\nDisappearances in their parks where they had worked that bothered him didn't make sense when they tried to find information they couldn't and they thought somebody with an investigative background on to be looking into it\nAnd that's sort of how it all started and I filed a series of freedom of Information Act requests against the national Park Service they have the largest contingent of federal we train police officers and the national park police\nAnd they're trained at the federal law enforcement training center they get the outstanding training or smart people they understand what should be done and I asked for a list of missing people well they came back and they said they don't carry any list and they don't have any list of missing people in their parks and jurisdictions\nAnd ah we talked about it and it had to be a semantics issues ... refiled and they came back an attorney called the Simon took why do you want this information\nAnd explain to him I said hey you can't ask that as a determining factor in for you\nThey said oh we're not we're not saying we're going to use that to determine we just want to know why you want it and I said well research and then he came back and he said well you don't have any of us and missing people\nI said well you have two hundred and eighty three parks monuments the patrol and you have a lot of police officers and then you have special agents that are to the detectives\nSo somebody must be keep it a list that each individual location or accumulate list at headquarters to understand what's happening and it's only politically correct if somebody calls in and wants to know the status of the case how you ever going to find it\nSaid no we don't have any less so years ago somebody said well David you ought to just file a request and see how many rolls of toilet paper at Yosemite National park I bet they have that even tore list\n[laughter] and of course they would but as it happened they came back and I said well\nI'm a printed author so I Want to use my author status\nAs an exclusion for fees and get you to accumulate that list for me a couple of weeks later they came back and they said well your books aren't enough libraries to qualify there's no such qualifiers just some arbitrary thing they said\nAnd then I said okay well why don't you just tell me how much it's going to cost me for you to put together the less I Want to list from Yosemite and I want to was from the national Park Service\nAnd they said well it's going to be thirty four thousand for the list from Yosemite and one point four million from the list from the entire system\nAnd I can't tell you how many people since I first said that years ago have tried to go at the Park Service and get it but nobody's ever been successful in getting the list from their entire system because they still say they don't have it and I've done interviews on other stations were\nHosts have said Dave I'll say it right now we will buy a laptop computer with the excel spreadsheets and we'll put a clip boards at every park and every jurisdiction they have and let them start accumulating the list and they could hire an intern during the summer that can screen\nTo come in the Park Service that have these and they could start from scratch doing it now\nOf course they they wouldn't even respond and wouldn't even acknowledge it but as you've stated in many others after you nobody believes them they say that there's a list exists\nWell a ... if they're going to charge one point four million more than a list exist um\nNo it's it's pretty clear they don't want\nTo cooperate on this that they don't want to pay more attention to be drawn to it and a night we're going to explore and maybe some of the reasons behind it up for those who have not heard your previous interviews let's let's get the ... points of the cases that jumped out at you that make it into your books and the kinds of things that you look for\nSome people need to understand that if you read the hundred search and rescue reports law enforcement reports on missing people you're not going to get a lot when you read a thousand certain things start jumping out at you\nAnd when I went through my third three hundred four hundred five hundred and read a report start making piles in my office of certain things\nAnd after you hit four five six thousand then things really start to delineate out one thing that's about a Ninety nine percent hit rate on the cases I write about is when they bring in canine search and rescue they can't I Can't find a scent and they can't track the person down\nNow someone who worked at a canine unit on the SWAT Team for a number of years our dogs had about Ninety nine percent capture rate\nAnd probably the reason why is that our dog's trained ten hours a week and it's directly a relationship between the amount of hours you trained with a dog and how effective they are going to be\nAnd there's a lot of people out there don't have the time the train a dog a lot\nThere might be a lot of great dogs out there who just cannot find a cent maybe the scent isn't there a bad reports where the dogs are brought to the scent location where the person was last seen they walk a foot they turn in a circle and they sit down or they laid out like they don't want to search or they have no interest\nSo that's a big one at the time the person disappears or shortly thereafter there's a major weather change\nWeather event if the victim is located they're located in an area that's been previously searched sometimes hundreds of times\nThe time of the disappearance a high high percentage of the time if three four five PM many of the victims have some type of disability illness or congenital abnormality\nOr if the victim is found and they're able to talk they have no memory or they can't explain what happened to him water plays a key role in this either the person disappears very near water or they're found in or near water\nBoulders and granted play a big role if it's in an area where these exist meaning the number one geographical cluster of missing people anywhere in the world she was Seventy national park\nWell that's probably the biggest conglomeration of granted anymore in the world but granted please much more of a role as I have explained in many of the books [noise]\nThere's a location in the event called the point of separation\nYou're walking down the trail with your friends your loved one and they walk ahead of you you fall behind them\nAt that point of separation something happens and that's where things go awry and I can't explain it but I can tell you that in interviewing dozens and dozens and dozens of people and you read these things in the report that's when it happens it's almost like some things\nSplit off from a group or a family that's when they move in\nYeah equipment malfunction and this is a this one is not in huge numbers but it's enough to bother me and I've written about it and prior books\nThere was an abnormal number of aircraft crashes in conjunction with these searches and then people talk about other equipment their car other things malfunctioning in conjunction with this [noise]\nAnd then the last one is I've written about many many highly intellectual people that have vanished\nThe probably the one that's gotten the most notoriety is I've written about physicists of a German heritage that have disappeared I'm Talking about us in German but our German ancestry that have disappeared and I've never been found\nIt's very strange I cannot find a physicist that have disappeared but isn't German so strange that is but there's also a lot of a\nMedical professionals that have disappeared physicians and things\nSo when when you think about people that just disappear in the woods no I'm not I'm not really interested in that I'm interested in the specific profile that I just laid out here\nAnd there's a this geographical crushed ring that I figured out why after I started putting pins in a U.S map Mr track this years ago\nAnd right now we're sitting at sixty geographical clusters in North America us and Canada now there are other locations in eleven other countries of the world where these this exact same sort of thing happening\nLot of times I found it on my own but many times after the book struggling to get rolling and people were different parts of the world read them they\nSay hey you know I live in New Zealand we've had a whole series of these very true Australia same thing you case same thing Canada same thing in Spain in the eighties worse I mean you'd\nBe surprised how this fits into this little niche um\nAnd it's I think you I read that it's eleven hundred thirty five cases and its men women there's four to one ratio direct\nI any idea why why so many more men than women maybe more men are out in the outdoors ... out there alone\nYeah yeah I I think that could be one thing maybe men take more risks than women I guess\nWe're talking with David ... about his latest work missing for one one land air water coming up in the next segment we're going to get into some specific cases and uh as I said before they will raise the hair on the back of your neck of the Beatles take us into the break we'll be right back\nAll right I'm not for a moment about search and rescue\nParameters because then that information becomes key to you picking the cases that huge zero in on I mean there are metrics there are there's data\nUm for search and rescue 'em yeah how how they proceed and and I have a huge database and I would think that gives clues about which cases stand out as being unusual\nSo that the data that you're trying to get to is really in the reports that they generate\nAnd the national Park Service for one won't volunteer up any of these reports now find name a specific date and a specific time and that person has been rural to be a missing and presumed deceased\nThey're released the report most times a lot of times they want there is a case from eighty six\nI'm an error the girl's name was Eris she was missing from Yosemite and I've tried to get that case ten times and I know nobody looked at the case in Twenty years and especially if they're told me I'll never see that case it's a standard missing persons case\nThere is no suspects there's no crime why can't I see it\nUm and just so people understand in law enforcement missing people is one of the few things that they handled it isn't criminal uh everything else in the law enforcement world is criminal oriented\nAnd missing people it's not against water go missing if you want to fall out of society you can and it's handled entirely different than a criminal investigation there's no prosecution that's going to emanates from these cases that are Thirty years old that disappeared in the middle you're somebody\nThese people harbor it like there is some secret in there that they don't want you to see\nAnd a lotta times I'll grant you that the reports are horrific they don't have much data they don't have much information other times that are really really good and I don't understand why there and want us to see it but there's this\nI called territorial behavior and many of the times they won't grant you access now in the state of Washington they have a mandatory disclosure law that reports have to\nOf the public upon the crust Colorado has outlaws well sort of like\nInformation Act a law but many states don't and law enforcement knows that and they won't give up anything\nUm so the first thing is you got to get these reports to really see what is there because you really can't trust I'm Sorry to say this George you can't trust the media because I Would say eighty percent of the time\nWhen I finally get a copy of the report\nThe news reports are totally completely wrong compared to what law enforcement said happened and I like to think back thirty\nYears ago forty years ago when there were reporters at really dug deep and got to the heart of the story and maybe today they can't spend the time to do it and so there's this superficial job of collecting information because it's really not too good these days\nWell I Would think that um you know reporters just regular beat reporters who get assigned to go out and cover a missing persons case\nYou know like outside of Las Vegas ever been a couple that you and I've talked to him up before it's not something they cover all the time so they defer to law enforcement if there's a law enforcement authority the person in charge of the of this scene um who tells you specifics here the details\nUm you know there's not many ways to take it further you you've heard of them you give them the benefit of the doubt not realizing that maybe they'd really don't want to tell the story of what's going on 'cause it's too weird to explain\nKnow makes me wonder about the national Park Service whether they don't want to give you this information because they don't want to scare people away from the parks or they don't want to give me the information because they have in a general idea about what's going on and they don't want to uh you know they don't want to have to answer questions about what do you think\nI think that the people the front line people that you see when you go into the parks\nHeart and soul the best of people in the world those rangers that are guiding you in the park and helping you and talking to you about nature those people have no idea what's going on it's the people at the top tier in the government\nThat are controlling really what's disseminated and how it's dispersed and communicated and it's those individuals that have this\nThey exude this belief that it's their stuff\nIt's not yours and you're not going to get it and I don't understand it\nI Can't explain it and every once in awhile through a backdoor way I'll get it anyhow I mean sometimes I'll get the reports when the sheriff's office helped on a search\nAnd they had some of the report from the national Park Service as well and mistakenly they just sent me everything and so I'll get a Park Service or a national monument report and I'm I'm looking through and I got ... I wasn't supposed to get that\nBut then it gives me some insight as to what's going on but it's rare\nLet's talk about a couple of current cases like you you sent me some information about one Samantha Sayers what's the deal there\n[noise] so twenty eight years old high performing person good athlete came from a Gerard Pennsylvania now living in Seattle She liked to go to this a location a cold ... for ... V. E. S. P. E.

Stevens card the trail had early in the morning and believed it had to be a day hiker but they were there really early\nWell they executed the trail later that day and they still solve the car there and it bothered them and they felt so strongly that something was wrong that they called the sheriff and a deputy came out random registration on the rent Iraq in the vehicle came back registered to a family\nAnd the registration hadn't been turned over to rent a wreck yet so the deputy left a message on the machine of the family who still owned the car on the registration system and he left\nSteven was return was\nDetroit on July second and parents were at the airport and he didn't arrive they called the Portland police tried to file a missing persons report and they were told that you couldn't file a missing persons report unless you were there in person [noise]\n[noise] so the next day hope and Larry got on a plane and flew to Portland and the ... the search and rescue finally get down the trail and it seemed that some assistance from the national guard king and since our teams\nSearchers face rain and wet conditions for many other days\nBut again the searched and searched for days after he really went missing and are hoping Larry praise the attitude of the volunteer searchers but stated that they were highly disappointed in the deputies\nThey said that the search didn't last long and was terminated without finding anything cadaver dogs were later put into that area I never picked up ... percent they ah they had a psychic approach them\nAnd the psyche went with them and some for service people down the trail that came to switch back look down the cliff they saw little TPP structure made a little trees lying on the ground\nAnd they said that down there you'll find Stevens glasses and that's where he died\nSearch and rescue went down there but they didn't bring their medical metal detector and the second city needed that to find it but they never found it nothing was ever found there and they are hoping understood that they are now any communications with the sheriff in years none ever with the forest service Stevens never been found\nStarting search them was two weeks after the disappearance is a very very difficult task and right here I'll say that Carol turned her when she disappeared in her park she at least less left a message on the inside of her car indicating when she was going to be out\nNow I see this every conference and I said on every time on I'm On with you people need to carry a personal located beacon cost about two hundred two hundred and fifty bucks there's no monthly service fee you can get them on Amazon\nYou activated it sends a signal to a satellite that someone needs help immediately to find you within eight feet they dispatched search and rescue I carry one every time I go out\nAnd I I Would say that probably Ninety five percent of these cases could be quickly remedied if everyone carry one of these\nWell whole lot of things went wrong in this case a just a comedy of errors it's not very comedic though I mean but I you know search that starts that late you don't have much of a chance of succeeding you\nDon't think you do um first of all he wasn't real acclimated to the area didn't understand the dangers probably wasn't dressed for success probably didn't have a backpack with them\nI doubt if he even had a Geological Survey map of the region\nBut when you go in an area like this there's so many things that can happen yeah I mean I tell people that you could go down this trail and if it's a trail that isn't very active you could be on the trail five or six miles down and break your leg on the trail and die on the trail\nAnd that doesn't that hasn't happened because it has and something very simple like this can just ruin your life when you could just have this little device that could save your life\nYou mentioned about the psychic they got involved in this case have you ever employed the services of a psychic or have you ever invest the indicates worse like it was used and they provided information that turned out to be accurate\nIs um there's remote your roof on coast to coast fairly frequently you will go unnamed but he he claimed he contacted me that he could find missing people\nAnd I asked him if he had ever found anybody and it gave me the name of this person and I listen to 'em and I said okay I'll I'll give you a case and during that week that I didn't talk to him I contacted this victims wife I said hated this person to help you finding your husband\nShe goes he didn't do anything he never found him he never gave me any valuable information my husband was found on other means by other searchers doing other things blah blah blah on and on\nGeorge I'm a guy that has really open mind and I will use anybody when somebody lies to me\nI won't use them ever again and that person blatantly lied to me and in other remote viewing cases there was one guy at a conference with your a couple of years ago really nice guy\nAnd the information he gave me wasn't even close in the realm of possible now there's another guy who's a remote viewer that I'm trying to work with right now hopefully he's better\nBut as far psychics I did a conference in LA about two years ago and there were seven or eight psychics owners role\nAt a this outside area at the conference and\nTowards the end I walked down this road introduce myself to every one of these psychic said what I did what I could use their services for and each one of them said\nYeah yeah yeah we want to help wanted help for sure yeah we can do this I email each one of them the next week when I got back and I never got a response from one of them\nWere talking with ... just about his newest book missing for one one land air or water Mardi Palan a pioneer of the San Francisco rock scene died at the age of Seventy six this past week here's a one of his best\nYou had a great job used an auditor for the state of Minnesota for the department of revenue\nOn September sixty thousand Fifteen his wife with kids or went to California\nAnd was a planned vacation well on that Sunday night Henry went out with a long time friend who's a very diligent guy on time third respectable\nAnd he and his friend went to the club early they left early on that Monday morning and ... states that he dropped him off at a location in friendly at the super gas station or a Seventy third avenue\nAt two twenty three am Henry phone appears Trump pocket dial this wife while she was asleep and California and left the link the voicemail strange sound screaming paintings growls et cetera\nAnd it's hard to determine when you listen to it if they are all human found or their animal sounds or what are they\nWe we have a recording of a news report that was done based on dissident includes um some of the clips from that phone call so maybe we can play that right now and then on the other side you can tell me a little bit more about it\n[laughter] it's a voice mail unlike anything you've ever heard of this war [noise]\nThere were two minutes worth of noise in the yard one [noise]\nVery little actual talking so what are you concerned disturbing never will deny call came from Henry McCain sell so it was labor date September Seventy two twenty eight in the morning McCain's worried\nWhy her domestic his health ...\nMinutes at a meeting he said that this is a nonprofit agency and act as a go between the police in the Liberian community leader is trying to get help your family make some sense the recording\nThe walls selling to hide it all\nFalls lightning moaning and pay like Moline\n[laughter]\n\nGet rich silent than someone either Henry or another person's than tapping I Try to picture where he was\nA when at night and like ... seconds and says what made him sound like that\nThe boys Neal isn't stark contrast to other articulate recordings of Medicaid speaking at an event either state auditor\nLeaves his new\nDimension is one piece of evidence now that the police are reviewing the police chief tell me even the FBI is analyzing the recording and voices for clues did she says the investigation ... deputy here on Tuesday\n[noise]\n... he's I knew you and say late all areas where Medicaid was recorded keen on he said in a sense of unity why does this whole series they have nothing in these\nSo that's a news report from Minneapolis television station or she the reporter mentioned in that report did that or the FBI was analyzing it to police were trying to make some sense of it have you ever seen any of that analysis or reports or did they come doing any kind of conclusion what the heck that was\nNever it claimed up so tight but one thing that I've written about in past books\nIs that the FBI follows these cases there's no reason for the F the FBI to be involved in this it's a local jurisdiction missing person that's it why is the FBI sticking their noses in this\nUnless they are interested in it for some other reason\nNow the last tower\nThat they pick up that phone was near Silverlake road and Mississippi street new Brighton one mile east of the Mississippi River\nAnd many of the cases I've written about in the past in missing for one and want a sobering coincidence dealt with men very healthy men that were found in bodies of water many times in the Mississippi when this happened I thought he is going to be found in the Mississippi or something else really close\nWell the location where he was eventually found was searched multiple multiple times canines helicopters ground teams everything\nOn November second this is almost two months after he disappeared for twenty in the afternoon\nA kayaker was on Russia lake one mile south east of the last time they can that phone and they saw body in the water and they recovered it\nThere was no violence at all to the body according to the corner the determination on the count on the cause of death was freshwater drowning Syria had been search multiple times and the FBI had that recording for analysis why was Henry McKay in the water\nNow one of the things that I presented in sobering coincidence about all of these young healthy men was that many times the families did not accept the determination by the corner on the cause of death and they paid for secondary autopsy several\nTimes when they did the second autopsy they found very high levels of GHB in the system\nThe victim and they were in level so high it didn't make sense so GHB it's commonly known as that date rape drug people get it\nThey pass out\nRealize that they're awake but they can't move and they can't react and if you think about this\nMany of the times that these people have disappeared never has any of their friends relatives et cetera seen the point where they disappeared sometime they disappeared amongst friends\nThey couldn't explain how they got from point a to point B canines couldn't track point to point a lotta times that happened in the winter and there was no marks in the snow point the point\nAnd if you think what GHB does to you it puts you in that state were you realize what's happening to you but you can't react so if they lead lead you say in a a bank of snow\nYou would die from hypothermia you wouldn't die from GHB intoxication if they placed you on the water you would die by drowning not from GHB and you see G. H. B. is not\nI was that are screened routinely by corners across the United states\nIt's only caught if you pay an extra amount to do this much more advanced screening for drugs and so it's very very rarely if ever found in systems because most people can't afford a second autopsy and I'm not saying that that is what is in all of these cases\nBut it showed up too many times to be ignored\nThat are recording it certainly seems like a he realizes he's in trouble or painter agony and then as the reporter mentioned it sounds like there's somebody out there that says something that's um\nThat's ah that's difficult to get your head around\nIt is in in many of the other cases I've written about that are related to these water unbelievably the victim is on the phone as they are going through this transition of disappearing\nOne time not far from where this incident happened a college kids walking down the street\nHe's on the phone with a girlfriend has and says where are you I Need you here now I Need you here now phone cuts off you sound days later in the Mississippi River another time a kid in east a western Minnesota\nIs missing and his parents are trying to find him and he's on the phone with him and he goes I don't know where I Am blah blah blah blah blah blah boom phone goes dead he was never found yet his car was found so these incidents that happened were there on their cell phone is something new and different\nBut when you listen to the incident as it evolves\nIt's very uncomfortable\nI mean it seems like they're being abducted kidnapped um and sometimes the bodies were found and sometimes they aren't and\nThey're they're just like snatched a by persons are known by things unknown almost like no gigantic bird is whooping down and snatching them up\nUm you know so many\n... agrees is calling me all the time and saying well you know we talked about this or heard John this YouTube say this this is\nI don't say that and I want people to understand that this is not a conspiracy theory topic because I'm a given you any theories I'm giving you All Facts\nAnd that's the way I Want people to understand this is that it's an unusual topic that's tied together the way an FBI profile or will profile a series of crimes\nWere linking together a series of facts to show that there's continuity here\nThat there are patterns say and um this book I wouldn't think that you'd have cases in the air um ah that would qualify under your criteria but you do you have a bunch of them and and it starts with looking at triangles including one that's here in Nevada right", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "01"}
