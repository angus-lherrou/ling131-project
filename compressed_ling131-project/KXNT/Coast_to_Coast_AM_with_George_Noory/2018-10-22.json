purposes tonight\nWe have subjects and guess tonight that are both\nAnd waiting both will challenge what you think you know about two very different subjects\nIn the second half the night a story that

fifty years for the full story to emerge from behind that official wall of secrecy and blame to remark\nInto the water with the sailors as they struggle to survive shark attacks and the elements for days and days wow what a story a coauthor is Lynn Vincent and Sarah ... will be here to share what is already a runaway best seller of a book\nA but first I had hinted last month when ... was here that he had something else in the works\nI'm not sure when the guy sleeps but he returns to the program coming up and just a few minutes and in a sense he is returning to his roots you know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it was ten years ago to discuss his first book the hoopla project\nWas a typical day polite as boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend and David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police and forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nKnew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down the area to scoop up which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some topic graphical some weather\nAnd I started to bring this together and then I went up there and make contact with the police that a police background I approached them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me I'm not going to not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth\nAnd every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury\nAnd I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that would be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there\nKnew many of The Elders and this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey you can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible\nAnd that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big store in Hooper that\nLive ... miles away who saw one coming into town I started to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements and the results were amazing\nBut I wanted something a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond unbelievable look\nAn individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artist to use ... outstanding law enforcement person\nAnd a Harvey and I met in right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd when Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey drew the sketch the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept and\nPardon me I have done this for a long time now together and we're best friends\nWe did two books that Hooper project and then we took a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of hoop a and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd I'm\nKind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo or something I started the most vocal the most audacious the most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world\nOlder [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and they will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push back cause\nBut since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking well it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who by Andrew the sketches Harvey myself in Harvey wife Gina ... also an agent for in Oklahoma\nWe were sat in stunned disbelief\nBecause the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge yeah they had hair all over the body but there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera\nAnd it was just shocking and\nWhen the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady into a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if you ... you look like\nAnd when you talk about the older they would consistently say this is another tribe of people just aren't animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least ... systems right\nYeah ... ... in the tribal area I met the one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see I'm\nThe one thing about the ... areas the trinity river like great salmon and steal head area\nA has just so much wildlife\nAnd if you drive through hoop uh from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world and there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I\nI Know that they're seen eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nYou uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here or do we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal life for human life\nAnd there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you for that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a a PHD name Melba catch them and Dr catch him\nWas one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera that we'd bring in and on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America the test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with and that led to\nOn your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of 'em were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA\nAnd then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva and all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA and what they showed was that the bypass it went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the females side\nTo the ... Arab region to ah Jerusalem to\nA Jordan ended that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up she brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her write a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this these samples could've been compromised\nYet as the paper was written up before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\nShe listen to some of this but you didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in the white paper in a white paper\nBut if you ... all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nMarry a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal I'm a observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I I don't think a lot of people understand it a this wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or it was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles it was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to a DNA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nNow people are saying going to say well how do you know that's a big for their\nWell big foot hair looks different than any other mammal hair in the world and I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using the hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called ...\nGet and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta different water attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes\nThat's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's going to like the you up a world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels um to the point of\nRoger let 'em material um and ah will stab people in the back end will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part the best I could say is it looks like a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part that everyone was\nStunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human match on gender bank and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted other than ours\nAnd how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kinda surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appeared that a big foot with trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipe some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe that bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this that people haven't read the study they read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out\nUm it's unfortunate\n\nYeah because it got down to a row and under the under the bus as she did as well um ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or are they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really a tremendous writing\nIn a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really\nA tremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading it off and making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight oh did you how did you find all these\nSo ... ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to make that fit that profile but we were looking for but then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown\nOf of the way the articles were worded\nIs two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description twenty four used eighth gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else now the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U.S sixteen in Canada\nThree in Hungary three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. now there were others but those were the both of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven\nNew York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but again it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article and the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius\nIs a lot of people say oh you know a few overlay this map with the maps of big foot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where are all you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes down like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this map of because this is a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how\nThey're kind of associated the fable occasions as the big fight [laughter] and\nBut it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries in mountains and in a excavations that really kinda got me thinking or these giants\nThe big for that were buried or were these something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the ... and showing the legends and stories about a big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to a some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidates were all these went and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian\nYet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nLook back and some of the descriptions there's one ... early ...\nYeah nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book is from the Marilyn gives that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an encounter a witness sees this on the cell to work up a rubber an animal\nBetween twelve and Fifteen feet high it's a shape resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body the seats are two feet long and Harry\nUh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description semi modern descriptions of big but\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds I I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body and so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nThe all new radio dot com app is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made

kill one maybe some kind of over loaded on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill them it's not going to happen\nThere are some reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship where they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nYeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man\nThat has a lot of injury to it because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it\nAnd it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it but a lot of people just poo poo it and say all the you know it was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nI find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times ah\nAnd they ... and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just phoning it in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nOr that's not where we associate big foot sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania be so prominent in the numbers and it's because I mean that was a center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties where\nThe bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived time\nOr exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to look at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first establish\nCivilization and cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is Ohio has a lot of these sightings well that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio he's a friend and I I went to spend four or five days within earlier this year\nAnd the strange things that he's told me that have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground really strange [laughter]\nBruce Mac can be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy are both in person and on the air and in his books or you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nWide I'd never heard of a meter and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about siting ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about present day fighting's again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the descriptions obviously you have to take them in a cultural contacts now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but ... the character Mobley um\nYou know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that that you've collected here\nCorrect and uh I people always telling me well what about the star wars creature that looks like Bigfoot and how it's kind of strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it it's a similarity\nUm some of the descriptions I I I wouldn't have to leave their way here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans may be rigged they really were literally wild men out there\nAnd usually and occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing quoting and kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break\nBecause why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen maybe they think they'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared\nYou know we could all through in our conjecture about why that may be happening but it happens too often for people to be fabricating it I I hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the hope is is are there any other tribes you would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one\nI mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where uh they have these and there's many times an association between and this is where they put people start their head start spending that fact\nWhere there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the hoop a book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and close time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars\nAnd they're they're not once they have your trust they will tell you hey\nYou know there's this association between us and them and there are different kinds of tribe and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of the certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big put people to die hards don't like it the UFO diehards a like an even less than they they're not comfortable with that at all\nBut you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are I don't know what you up those are where they're from but um there was enough cases are over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can't ignore it I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really is unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm and I started talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know let me go talk to my parents so they own a huge Jerry for anyone out there and talk to them in this all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know\nEvery once in awhile Mike how will come back from nowhere completely milked\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] then the the same\nMan told him he says you know every once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me\nTurn around get back on the horse or get back on my ATV\nA far corner my property something tells me don't turn around\nIt back on the horse or get back on my TV and all the [noise] and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property a helicopter\nSo out dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust of some of the dairy farmers way out in the middle they're going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore and many times when the natives are in the middle of the woods\n[noise] [noise]\n[noise]\nRight here we go calls for my guess Dave ... is the first time caller Gwen in Pittsburgh hike when\nThey're um thank you for letting me on your show first of all welcome back in about\n... I have had many sleepless nights listening to everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time\nSo good job on your finding 'em I wanted to talk about the big thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying it how it's related to wild man\nI'm I feel like you're from or off so that way that we can find out more about wild land because there are Amazonian tribe that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour idea of revolutionary and I feel like within the next ten years will definitely have an answer because of their own and my question is like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding bit for that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people uh hasn't worked real well and you can't use a drone international park it's against the wall and there's a huge trying so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush is going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should kind of touch on it for the people here\nYour work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big like can you tell us about that\nActually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they've seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal browns they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made of noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you can hear it it ... I mean it was just taking these giant stride it in October garbage cans you head alarms going off then that the police officers chased it\nUh I think they they found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI'm I should call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it ... through infrared you can see the the ball of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel\nAnd through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at the entrance to this uh this tunnel staff\nStruggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er at\nThe entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm feature lists dark humanoid shaped\nLike ahead with no neck on a on a body it's just stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but are there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um has seen it all over the you went to a base and so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual\nPhenomena and we don't know um\nWest of the Rockies Kyle in Utah I Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind so\nSo I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph ... Smith the ones you talk to keen on his saddle um he taught big foot\nIt happened in Eighteen [noise] ah oh five of us are Eighteen thirty five\nHe was on his way to another ... ... and here's an awful lot of time that the prophet and he ... he ran into a cane and ah he described Cain as the as a tall a figure that was taller than his saddle\nAnd ah just to fill the fifth talked a cane and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I'm a man I'm personally wander here and there and I might go will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls\nSays you brought that up I just thought the Mormon culture LVS ... that we have you know there's two story really famous that story than just killing Smith who is Joseph Smith nephew you\nKnow his brother had an encounter with Wesley Smith a in Hawaii at the dedication and the the lady Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one uh came came to read the doors of the temple\nAnd I'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priest and to cast came out and so he loves his hand and they just crashed a cash yeah king wrong and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's not talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading a book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot and he said he can he does he have any idea what's going on 'cause like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a coyote let everyone listening here tonight is probably the the weirdo experts in their family and then there are certainly ... social circle a you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kind of topics\nThey are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big foot type encounter or is that something else\nOr the description that the Smith gave was would match ... but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that\nGave was would match Bigfoot but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big ... may be some night some type of the film from the Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense\nNow Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd the other things like in the Smith and sent the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mind spoke but more like it spoke to him so hard to say I don't know but one thing\nLike this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things I've always stated that I'm a man of facts\nAll of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met\nWho's read my eight books and they have been thousands that it's come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nDoesn't [laughter]\nAnd I should point out that you know you did to address this may be crowded and hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people as far as you know well\nNo no killing them I I think I'm going okay there's there's a story that\nJohn Green wrote about a prospect that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumping them in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit\nI followed greens lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how it came up came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one isn't there some other account in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person through the forest\nUnreal you know they are\nSo low but there's

out\nAnd it exceeded all my expectations the subject is rubbing the writing is superb the research is meticulous and this story this tragedy really touches a nerve in ways that I think we will explore over the next few hours at for anyone who's not a student of naval history\nYou know the first time most of us probably heard of what little we know about the USS Indianapolis it can be traced to one of the best scenes in the history of American movies is from blockbuster Spielberg movie jaws\nRoberts draws character went delivered a moving powerful slightly tipsy account of what motivated him to become a shark hunter\nI'm Lynn what do we start with you\nOkay that would be great um Indianapolis as Sarah mentioned was the fifth the Fifth Fleet flags shifts and I'm\nA small part that a lot of people don't know is that she was the flagship at the battle is over an hour where your father drove the landing craft and I'm\nIn the weeks leading up to the the actual invasion she was participating in the shore of environment and during that time and march thirty first Nineteen forty five she was hit by a kamikaze\nNine men were killed twenty six injured and that was what really sent around this faithful journey had that not happened she might have gone down in history as the victorious flagship of the world war two specific theaters\nUm victorious at open now as well as nine other major battles but instead she went back to their island California for repairs and that's where she was on July sixteenth Nineteen forty five\nWhen general Leslie grows and the other leaders of Manhattan Project including President Truman\nDecided that they want us to send the components of the atomic bomb little boy which would later ... ahead to the forward areas and trim and did this a lot of uh a lot of people don't know that Truman did this before he even knew that he would use the bomb because at that time\nUh everyone thought that there would be an invasion of mainland Japan so\nIndianapolis was selected to transport these novels components of the bombs she did that a native record breaking run to a Pearl Harbor\nAnd then pushed on Tiffany an island where she dropped off the components of the atomic bombs and then two days after that on July twenty eighth Nineteen forty five she set out on what was going to be a routine voyage across the Philippines Steve from Guam for the Philippines and all my street west down shot\nAnd right when she was in the middle of the specific or the middle of the Philippines sees on July thirty is Nineteen forty five just a few minutes after midnight\nOr she intersected course with the Japanese submarine called I fifty eight demanded by lieutenant commander Moshe Sarah how she might have actually motive fired six pools torpedoes\nHit Indianapolis with two of them the first one almost completely lose a foul off the ship Indianapolis was a heavy cruiser\nThe second one hit her image shifts the vessel went down and twelve minutes and you know we've been talking longer than twelve minutes it was very very wet without three hundred men went down with the shift a\nLittle under nine hundred made it into the water alive\nAnd when they made it into the water those who survived their wounds were very optimistic if they were going to be rescued soon but uh they weren't and they've spent five nights and four days in the water struggling to survive\nAnd ah as you mentioned earlier they've they fought madness they've fought the hydration they've a shark or eventually they fought each other because of the madness and that is the story that most people know about India\nA shark or eventually they fought each other because of the madness\nAnd that is the story that most people know that Indianapolis she was spotted completely by accident on about mid day on the fourth the fourth day after five nights for days in the water and only three hundred and sixty men survive\nSarah secrecy plays such an important part in this and every step of the way and it leads to tragedy threatened with tragic tragic results because of the secrecy of the what they were carrying and they did did you did sort of continued over after they drop them off\nOr what did you share with us the secrecy or I ... which obviously was necessary military necessity or lead to tragedy and how you'd probably interfered with your ability to get to the core of the story\nAbsolutely I mean there were multiple areas that held secrecy and the story that led to the demise of Indianapolis and ultimately the men being lost at sea for five days\nAnd you know first of which being how messages where transmitted across the Pacific during the war you know there was a level of coding that had to be taken into consideration and you know one of the ships that\nIndianapolis was to report to when it arrived in the Philippines was an admiral McCormick and the message he received was garbled\nAnd so you know political said that oh it didn't you know didn't come through clearly and no one asked for a repeat so they didn't even know Indian Indianapolis was supposed to be reporting to them\nYou know that was one of the first thing I'm so when she didn't show up they didn't know she was supposed to show up you know um aside from that there was protocol that noncombatants shit the rivals didn't have to be reported and so when she didn't arrive lieutenant thought well I guess I don't have to report that either\nAnd so he took it upon himself not to say anything even though he knew the ship wasn't there and these were all put in place you know to protect our vessels during wartime but the secrecy of that and the protocols ultimately lead to her not being found you know and then\nBeyond that\nYou know we had broken the Japanese code at this time and there were a message trafficking going across the Pacific and the Philippines see reporting you know various subs in the area well none of that was related to captain McVeigh because they didn't want anyone to know that the codes have been broken and that we were using that\nAnd so you know he should not have been there without an escort he should have you know had you know\nTaking a step back Indianapolis was not you know made really for combat it was made to get to a scene or to a battle quickly and have guns and so she should have had something you know first of all that sonar and second of all that had any\nHarm or ability you know the armor too yeah and armor\nI mean she was part of the treaty crews are so are are more was exceptionally send compared to many of the newer shift and so that was one of the reasons why she's saying so quickly\nUh you know so all of these things kind of came together to form the perfect storm and so much of that played into the secrecy of this mission and why she was out there and why this information and wasn't passed along to the captain who may have made different decisions\nKnowing that there was a direct threat in its path\nTo me that was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I Know there's been\nThe direct threat in its path\nTo me this was it difficult to get the the the survivors to trust you I I Know there's been so many wrong stories in wrong conclusions made about what happened there then I Would think they might still be suspicious even decades later\nWell I think a big part of that they mentioned is that I had spent several years visiting with spending time with their families\nTalking with them that you know with no other interests other than learning their story\nAnd so they I think trusted me by the time that I actually wanted to start doing interviews and putting the story down on film or you know at the screenplay and eventually as a book and limit as well when she came in we had this trust built in with these men that they knew and genuinely wanted to tell\nThe accurate story however heart and however long that would take we would tell the true story\nWell he was uh it it was amazing the uh how how widely you cast the net here um you know in creating real characters are you you you have to know these people a lot of the people who are characters in the book obviously didn't survives you're basing them together I guess from people who did know them but\nUh you know may be among the most interesting is ... the guy who was commander the sub the sink the USS of Indianapolis a limb talk about him a little bit he's a he's a\nHe's not a are stereotypical Japanese commander\nThat's right one\nOf the things that we tried to do is really pulled back to land on the Indianapolis story because really the man or before the crash and that is just to to you know\nCircle back and the man who ferry the atomic bomb aboard USS Indianapolis was an army named Robert and I'm a major named Robert Feldman\nAnd he had spent the last couple of years after the war renting down all of the material that they feared the Germans were using to try to develop their own atomic bomb or on the continent of Europe\nSo once that messing with the and then burn and carry decision about components of little boys defending an island\nUm that is the final grading the editor of the European and if the conflict and so in writing the book we try to pull back that lands and bring in a lot of these other characters and world leaders and figures\nIncluding the Japanese point of view in a dish and to have overhead and for your you know and it's coming you've got to leave and come ... commander\nAnd what we tried to do storage way to even to recognize it even those men were enemies at the time that they were all acting out of their content and conviction and getting when\nIn a sympathetic way I'm meaning that they were acting out of there since their conscience and conviction and so um we were able to make great use if men are passionate as um\nWell it was and then more sort of published after the war his first published in Nineteen fifty two and a Japanese language\nAnd then it was later published by Henry Holt in the fifties or here in America in English\nAnd it was really an examination of Japanese submarine warfare in World War two but written from men are half modus point of view and there was a chapter on his devoted to Indianapolis\nThat because we were looking at the larger Pacific War in the end of the of World War two in general\nWe were able to really develop his personality a lot he was the commander who cared for his men he was the commander who was very very frustrated with the state of technology on Japanese submarines and really against protocol at the time because Japanese had a very autocratic top down military\nUm he went around baying on doors after ... radar and more technology for his that Marines because Japanese submarines didn't have read or write up until the end of the war\nAnd so he was very frustrated because he was seeing a lot of it is rather than commanders\nGo down to sell the grave or lack of technology they're carrying you had a wife he has three sons um and eventually in addition to his\nUm [noise] book which was called fun\nUm we were also able to interview his granddaughter a and it even more information about his later life after the war\nAs we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because\nUh and yet even more information about his later life half before\nWell as we'll find out a little bit later he was kinda ticked off because the U.S Navy I mean you took the extraordinary step of having him testify in court martialed for captain McVeigh and then uh\nThey didn't really want to hear his version of how things went but we'll we'll circle back around that I'm sure I Want to get to uh the moments right after these torpedoes swam a decided the Indianapolis\nA chaos breaks out um\nYou know we we heard that clip from Robert showing the movie jaws saying that no signal was sent a distress signal are not exactly true but sort of true why don't you pick up the story there tell us describe those next couple of chaotic moments after the torpedoes yeah\nSure well it was just after midnight so you know the moon was behind clouds that had been an intermittent cloudy night and ... and that was part of the reason why you know\nI don't know if he would say it's lucky for ... the clouds just part of the moon came out for just a moment enough for him to see the silhouette of the ship and so you know after it was struck\nGiven the power went out with the second torpedo and so there was no power on the ship they couldn't communicate over the first them see\nYou know the ... from the sound system and so there was no one to say abandoned ship you know over the speakers there was no one to tell people to report to battle stations\nThey had to pass that from mouth to mouth well this is a six hundred and ten foot long ship the great big ship so with the chaos happening and the ships thinking and twelve minutes you have to imagine that compartments or flooding incredibly quickly you know the ship is starting to tilt\nFirst to the star bird and then it goes down by the bell\nSo men are being trapped inside the ship unable to his state from their compartment and yeah and ... and mentioned before they believe about three hundred and men went down with the ship\nAnd even further to this because there wasn't any direct command able to be broadcast to the men people started abandoning ship very shortly after\nThe ship was torpedoed all the way until you know men went down with her and were able to escape so these men were spread out over a mile and a half is what they believe\nAnd you know those who went down on or went off on the ... the low side they would have been with more of the supplies you know there were only twelve raft that they believe got off the ship\n'em but no standard protocol at that time was to go off the high side the port side well the majority of the men went off outside and\nThere was no supplies so they weren't in rafts they were you know somewhere in even in life jacket some were holding on to flotsam that they could find in the water as long as they could until they could get to someone who could help\nThem you know a fellow ship made or whomever and others had to just swim and tell a sailor would pass away and then everybody would help them take the life jacket off the dead Taylor and put it on them I mean this was\nIncredibly chaotic so scary these are sixteen Seventeen and Eighteen year olds that had just gotten on the ship not some of them not even three weeks or a month earlier you know they just went on board right before the last mission\nHadn't really gone to any drills yet some didn't know how to swim and they're just thrown into the middle of the Pacific at midnight it's pitch black they're covered in fuel oil because in a you know an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nLieutenant a red ban actually released the fuel\nThe oil because in the you know in an effort to save the ship but the last moment\nWe kind of a red vain actually released the fuel into the water and so this is very very sick oil that can only be transferred with heat so it's like tar on these men and they can't tell who anybody is they can barely breed they're swallowing it their vomiting\nThere at this point they're trying to stay alive some have injuries and they won't last much longer\nAnd you know they they say that those who head injuries and didn't really make it past the first day but the men who were able to escape without injuries were still suffering from the early stages of dehydration because of vomiting this feel so no one's really great shape\nYou know by the time the sun comes up the first morning but they're very optimistic that rescue is going to come because they believe there's a ship in the Philippines waiting for their arrival\nThat there wasn't then you know there were attempts to get a signal well they just didn't go I guess they they they they they weren't successful\nExactly um\nI guess within a couple of days it becomes clear that the new ones coming or if they're coming there they're going to have a hard time finding it because as as you describe in the book they're spread out all over the place and in these big waves are pushing the group's further further apart right I'm\nLynn maybe you want to talk about that a little bit are you in this context there's incredible acts of heroism that you described from some of these ... sailors who were doing their best to help everybody else and then at the same time there's some incredibly selfish acts of brutality that happen as well\nThat's right um there were incredible acts of heroism and as you mentioned in as Sarah mentioned the currents they move that about one mile an hour in that area and they also move in these sort of giant eddies or world if you will\nAnd so two men that would be together\nIn the morning could be a mile apart by afternoon and and all the time these twelve that swelled some days it's it's clear his glasses on the day of the rescue but some days there these twelve twelve along with these current so over time over the course of the the five nights and four days\nThe men become spread out over a twenty five mile area\nAnd I'm One of the rescue pilots later wrote that from altitude\nA rescue plain looking down on a situation like that that head of one man would be the size of a human hair scene in cross section or diameter from across the room so basically they were invisible\nAnd you mentioned acts of heroism access cowardice one ... one real hero was I'm\nA captain parts he was the commander of the Marines detachment that was aboard the ship and the largest swimmer group and the water's the they did as Sarah mentioned the the men in the water we're spread out initially over a mile and a half and then they just got further and further apart with those currents\nThe largest group that had nothing but life jackets was about four hundred men\nAnd kept in park was in that group and he really spent\nTwenty four hours a day trying to keep the men together the only resource that that group of men had the sides their life jackets which not even all of them had life jackets\nWas the single line that was about a hundred feet long and so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line\nAnd that was about a hundred feet long and so they form that line into a circle and the men were to tie themselves to the line and kept in park would uh\nHelp and then that didn't have life jackets and several times he would get a life jacket from the dead sailor and then give it to another man who needed a life jacket and he did this numerous times\nAnd he would round up the stragglers and encourage everybody until finally on the third day the succumb to hallucinations and\nAnd he died and when he died that group became very desperate because they thought wow if this brave man can't make it how are we all got to make it\nAnd then in terms of cowardice um you had precisely the opposite happening with with and then being a selfish\nAnd men are even officers taking place on a raft for example when there were wounded men who needed the place I'm worse\nThere was also the ah in some of the rap groups they had some supplies and there was hoarding 'em ups supplies and and of water especially\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experiences which listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio

of the Japanese seven commander\nAnd indeed captain McVeigh did see stick as these zigzag ing it evening twilight or just before the ship was sunk\nBut standing orders of the military put that in his purview that was at his discretion and he chose to exercise that discretion um and then when commander ... testified at the trial he said that he would have stuck McVeigh\nWhether he had been ... or not and then it didn't make a difference\nBut he was testifying and Japanese through a translator and the translator did not translate exactly what he said uh correctly and commander ... could understand enough English to know that but not enough to\nReally repair the damage\nAnd also he was you know in this very intimidating environment and so I don't think it was really can conducive for him to sit there and argue either\nBut I'm In later interviews Sarah found out from his granddaughter that that was something he always regretted was that um he had been translated incorrectly and that had and that ... in part had kept in the day\nHe was angry years later zero right at the with the retiring of the USS Indianapolis Sabrina namesake ship many years later there was an attempt to get him to open up and share the story and he wanted nothing to do with it\nExactly you know they're a commander built or I'm Sorry captain and built Tony who was the commanding officer of the Indianapolis namesake submarine when she was a he commissioned bill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to\nWhen she was a he commissioned bill went over and tried to talk to ... and he said they didn't believe me then they won't believe me now and he wanted nothing to do with talking with him you know but he did what I was actually pretty incredible as he actually wrote a letter you know kind of flashing forward a few years to the exoneration effort ...\nWrote a letter explaining his side of the story and saying that the captain should never have been found guilty and you know kind of did what he could do in order to help things on race this man\nYou tell the story in the book about a Nineteen sixty reunion a group of survivors and kept the McVeigh goes up and he's not exactly sure how he's going to be received by by the crew because you know he was court martialed um he received as you noted the book these\nTerrible letters from a family you didn't really been punished enough\nAnd um you know I'm\nReally guilt tripping him for years afterward so he shows up at this Nineteen sixty event and how was he received a when\nHe was received with open arms he have very much dreaded going to this reunion in Nineteen sixty he hadn't seen these men [noise] except for just a couple of them but most of these men he had not seen since Nineteen forty five right after the court marshal\nSo they decided to have a reunion and they have their reunion in the ships namesake city Indianapolis, Indiana\nAnd captain McVeigh was dragging it that when he got there they actually um\nTravelled out a dozens and dozens that survivors and their wives met him at the airport and they formed\nTo receding lines are across the tarmac because they didn't have debt ways the way we do now they would they would just they would the plane right onto the ramp and so they formed two lines\nAnd when captain they they got to the bottom of the aircraft loading stairs\nSomeone shouted attention on deck and everybody's snap to attention and then they began to cheer and the clapping and tears came to his eyes and he he couldn't believe that they were receiving him so warmly and that continued through the entire reunion weekend\nSarah talk a little bit about difficulty in getting materials you talk about going through archives and records a share with me did you run into road blocks that you could not get past than in Europe so what were they\nActually one of the the documents that really helped us pay the biggest picture was the quarter of inquiry documents and\nYou know I had tried for years Lynn had you know come into the picture and joined me in this effort to get a copy of this document and the reason it was so important was that it was really the first recorded testimony of any of the survivors right after the sinking\nSo you know just days after their rescued there in the hospital in Guam and their testimonies are taken and so we tried everything to get these documents and this actually this specific report\nAnd we would come back you know oh it's last forever oh one you know we got one copy of it and it was entirely redacted and you know freedom of freedom of Information Act\nShould've allowed us to have this and then you know we contacted the the source again and our contact said well we don't have an an redacted version doesn't exist and so interestingly enough you know a a friend or actually at a young man who became a friend\nWas the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and said fifty three men\nA friend or actually a a young man who became a friend was the grandson of the rescue pilot who landed in the water and saved fifty three men his and his grandson was actually um\nI'm an inspector general sorry I was trying to remember the title he's inspector general works with the navy and he was actually the person who got us this document and this kind of showed us really\nTestimonies of what happened not only when the ship was torpedoed and those final moments but what was happening in the water because in the court marshal they did not allow any of the testimony about what took place in the actual water because they didn't you know that would impact how\nMcVeigh was viewed in so it was kept strictly to what took place when the ship was torpedoed\nAnd the events leading up to that so this new quarter of inquiry document was so important because you know Seventy years later stories can change your stories can be impacted by other stories but this was the purest form of what really took place not only when the ship saying but in the water for those five nights and four days\nWhen you talk about the white immediately after they were rescued what it was like for the survivors where they were taken I I Would assume more of them died after because of their injuries and exposure\nWell if you did die and and if you can imagine how awful that\nWas not only for the men themselves that for their families to know that they had actually made it all the way to rescue only to die of their exposure and their injuries um\nSo I think three hundred and twenty were actually rescued is that correct Sara yes three hundred and twenty were rescued but only three hundred and sixteen ultimately survive so they were taken to base hospitals around the Philippine see eventually converging on Guam\nWhere they had um some\nTime to recover before they had to give their testimony\nAnd then they went aboard the USS homeland ... which was an escort carrier and they actually landed in our home city of San Diego where they were\nI actually participated in a parade and then a very quickly they went home a\nCop buses and trains back to their hometowns some of them ... got out of the navy some of them had survivors leave and then got out some of them stayed and made careers of the navy [noise]\nUm and you know this was the greatest generation so the vast majority of them and they just kind of put this behind them they went on to have careers as engineers and fishermen and everything you can think of police officers\nThat there were those who could not hold a job and there were those who became alcoholic and um had many many struggles\nAnd almost to a man none of them talked about it and not even to their families and they held it in for years and years and years um some for sixty years um but\nMostly they didn't talk about it today that would be a lot different I think people would be out trying to get a book deal or a movie deal or something like that that these men were different\nI think about that Robert ... character in jaws you know you got that story bottled up he becomes a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm just removing seen those great I was going to use the clip anyway\nIt was a short cut her as a result of being one of those guys and I'm a that's a very moving scene in it and it was great I was going to use that clip anyway I was really glad to see the coverage him in the book uh sir I did you always have in mind keeping that in there\nWell yeah it's really you know when Leonard I've got across the country talking to groups about the story and but\nYou know one of the things that really comes out every time that most people learned about this story from China so it's an essential part of this story history\nIs that you know the public learned about it this way and interestingly enough some of the children of the survivors actually first heard about it and that their father was involved in it by watching jobs you know they came home several account\nCame home saw the movie or really impacted by it and especially the thin and only to find out their dad was on the ship the scene and about so and it's pretty incredible the men didn't talk about it that long but then to find out this way that that's you know how your dad served in World War two\nThat's N O W kids three five five one set\nYes you online degrees tax now two three five side one seven O O W cues three by five one seven\n\n\nZero here with me your thoughts are when you heard the news I think it was last year that the ah Indianapolis had been found a a mission funded by Paul Allen\nActually it was about four in the morning when I received a phone call from bill ... who was the gentleman I mentioned earlier the some commander of Indianapolis\nAnd you know bill was contacted by the navy and he called me and since Sarah they found the ship\nAnd I didn't know what he was talking about it for in the morning of and so you know dating my faculty and you realize what was going on very quickly and was astonished I mean this was something that several people before\nThe ... group which was the vessel that were slew responsible for finding the ship there'd been several attempts and they were the first ones to be successful\nAnd what was interesting about it is they said you have three hours before we release this information to the press so go ahead and call the survivors so villain I spent the next\nThree hours of calling the survivors up and being able to share with them the news that they're shifted been found and so that was a pretty incredible experience to hear their take on all of it\nWhat's the reaction in general\nIt was really I mean it was very somber was most of them couldn't believe it actually happened in that it happened in their lifetime I'm ... [laughter]\n... mostly reverence and then there was a young man by the name of a fan Lopez he was a sailor and Indianapolis in the day the ship sank hit a really good day playing dice with his buddies and so he wanted to know if they would go down and find his money suck\nThat off winnings [laughter] you know\nAcross the board it was general you know respect and reverence for the story but you know there was a ... a couple of funny quotes here and there from the guys that you know they're always sailors that hurt\nAnd inland you know we've heard a little bit about road blocks put up a to the information you know were they were not entirely helpful and every step of the way to get the story told what about reaction to the books to come out from the navy\nOh boy we've been very very gratified by the reaction there is um an admiral named Sam Koch who is the director of naval history and heritage can end\nAnd we made contact with admiral Cox at the survivors reunion and I believe it was funny if ten or twenty sixteen and we said while through we'd really like to have your support in your health on this\nAnd um he was helpful and directing as various resources\nBut if you can imagine sending this real work at the heart that you've done to try to honor these men and honor the legacy and tell the whole story of the ship and\nAnd give the entire history and draw new analysis that various things that happened in the story if you can imagine taking that and then sending it to the director of naval history and heritage and and saying hey sir hey admiral what do you think\nOh boy we were we nervous about that but he really really has endorsed the story and I went to his full court since he saw\nThat he really really has endorsed this story and I meant as his full court since he saw what his what we came up with\nWell I Know Sarah has an award winning documentary film about it sure seems like it would make a great movie I'm a full big screen movie any thoughts about that\nWe are actually working on that right now so stay tuned\nOkay we'll take a couple of calls I've got some other questions but uh west of the Rockies Jerry in Modesto, California as a personal connection to the story I jury\nYeah are you doing my father was a on the ship was the first one or the ... or to rescue the sabers in the water and I still have the one car being used and she was discharged from school\nAnd I never saw my father ... years past ... years ago but I never saw him cry until you can talk about that story\nThat's amazing what he uh with the on the U.S has a piece of tape do el or that that that you know the name of the ship that the man\nWho ... and I don't remember it's on it's on it's been stone and I was thinking about that before I called and I thought yeah what was the name of the ship\nHe said me she was the first one who knew him and he was talking you lose horrific you know he tried to tell the story a little bit and my father never talked about in the about Egypt all that you know all those years you know\nHe was like a you know just if you're part of the ethos of that generation that those\nOh yeah yeah he was in World War two and Korea or he was a gun or dream donors may first class you know but he ... he was a police officer who's officer for Thirty years but that is an incredible story\nAbsolutely heroic to go into harm's way like that and um if he would support the Basset\nOne interesting story is that the commanding officer of the ... that\nWas considered to be a coward by some of his men and indeed when they arrived on the same if you didn't really know what he was getting into and ah he needed it at that had been found could probably buy a submarine but they didn't know what exactly had happened\nAnd there was um a sailor his spotted a large shark and the water and he said look at that fish\nWell fish is another word for it torpedo and so the cat in ... he tried to get everybody out of there he said he said I'm all ahead full we're going to get outta here we are going to leave the scene\nAnd his officers actually need need and lock the captain in his state room and continued with rescue have to be interesting if your dad this had been on that ship\nThanks Jerry appreciated wildcard line run and used in the morning on good\nAh my father was also in the navy and he was on a destroyer escort Cecil jade Doyle he was twenty six years old he was the end soon doctor and what's interesting over forty years I had opened up\nOne of his uh I guess his seat just you know of all of us remember was and I found unbelievable and eye witness accounts a letter of the eye witness accounts\nFrom the doctor's point of view of the rescue of the survivors\nI've got a letter in front of me it's faded August fifth Sunday at sea\nOf the rescue of the survivors I've got the letter in front of me it's faded August fifth Sunday at sea\nAnd it's a phenomenal letter I think the uh women would love to see this to read this it talks about the sharks it talks about the fact that he pulled these guys up kicking the sharks off their rear end\nShowing 'em up with the with a line given morphine given him penicillin\nThis is an unbelievable letter from the view of the doctor and it was my dad\nAnd he has been that some of the reunions but never did talk about this\nBut the fact that I found this letter it's about five six pages of the whole of count its its history its historical I Would love to share this with a young ladies and if I can get of getting information and\nI'll tell you what Ron why don't you hold on and done a A R R gal there will get the information for you know we'll pass it on to win and Sarah and a thank you for calling appreciate\nYou sharing that I I'd like to see that myself thank you so how many how many of the survivors are still with us Sarah there's fourteen still living I don't assume that they still have a gathering do they\nActually you know um we've gone to several events all

in a sense he is returning to his roots you know the first time he was on coast to coast I Believe it's ten years ago to discuss his first book the hoop a project\nWas a typical day polite as boots on the ground investigation this time of the big butt legend and David spent two years among the ... tribe to hear their tails and legends and to apply police in forensic methods to figure out what was being seen in the forests of the Pacific northwest\nAnd I knew that there was Native American history with the topic that ran deep and I needed it within say six to eight hour driving location from where I Lived at the time in Los Gatos California\nAnd I coordinate down in the area to scoop up which is about thirty miles south of bluff creek where the Paterson given one film was made in sixty seven\nSo I started to do some geographical research some\nTopic graphical some weather and I started to bring us together and then I went up there and make contact with the group of police that a police background I approach them and they said hey maybe you can break down some doors for me\nNot going to I'm not going to stretch the truth I'm going to tell the truth and every witness that comes forward they're going to have to write an affidavit to what they saw under penalty of perjury and I wanted to raise the bar on the topic a little bit so that that\nWould be no question about what was stated because they sign it and there'd be no question about it for the story was fabricated because it was done under perjury\nSo I I started that route and a couple of the cops there knew many of The Elders\nAnd this was so helpful and breaking down the doors these guys with introduced me and they'd say hey\nYou can trust this guy ah he's a friend he's credible and that's the way it got started and uh after I heard maybe ten or Fifteen of these stories from ultra credible people in and out of the tribe\nA one was a store manager that ran this big story in Hooper that\n... miles away who saw one coming into town I started to think about my police days and they used to work with a forensic artist that was just phenomenal and he would sit down with a witness be able to draw the sketch from just the witness statements\nAnd the results were amazing but I wanted something that a slightly different so I could a line this person with a tribal setting in Native Americans and I found a diamond\nUnbelievable look an individual name Harvey ... who was assistant director of the Oklahoma bureau of investigation and the chief forensic artist FBI trained for the state of Oklahoma and Harvey is not only a world famous artists tease\nOutstanding law enforcement person and a Harvey and I met in right away we just cook like brothers\nAnd when the Harvey would sit down with say a witness to a robbery and draw the sketch a suspect and the suspect was later caught I Swear to you it is like the suspect was in the room and Harvey due the sketch of the suspect that is how accurate this man has\nAnd so when I brought him in to the Native American tribes they immediately accept accepted him because he's just shy enter ... Native American chief got a law enforcement background so we can kind of smell when it happens and\nPardon me I have done this for a long time now together and uh we're best friends we did two books that Hooper project and then we did a follow up book called the tribal Bigfoot where he went outside of hoop a and draw sketches of what other people saw again took statements under penalty of perjury\nAnd I'm kind of how it started\nAh you said you don't have a dog in the fight meaning you're not committed to one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo uh when I started the most\nThe one position or another because there are several different camps in the big world right\nOh bingo ah when I started the most local the most audacious\nThe most vulgar [laughter] are probably the people who believe it's an eight and\nThey will run you over the world demean you they will do anything to push that cause but since they were the most outspoken I thought well this must be true and I kinda went down that path thinking wow it must be an aid must be some kind of a background\nBut I still kept that open mind in when we the first day that we sat down with the people in and around who drew the sketches\nHarvey myself in Harvey's wife Gina ... also an agent for in Oklahoma we were sat in stunned disbelief\nBecause the sketches were very human like yeah they were huge yeah they had hair all over the body that there was a human quality that you just couldn't miss and they didn't look like apes they didn't have that ape characteristics that you would think of in a face in a chest et cetera and it was just shocking\nAnd when the witnesses saw the sketches to a lady into a man they would consistently say Harvey you nailed it that if the Shockley what you look like\nAnd when you talk about The Elders they would consistently say this is another tribal people just aren't animals these are people\nThey had a sort of developed a relationship with him at least and coexistence right\nYeah ... ... in the tribal area method one of the managers presidents chairman of the tribe\nA and they said so that they looked at a map and they said so this is their area we don't go in there and this is your area this is our area and if they can come into our area and they do regularly and that's why we see I'm\nThe only thing about the hoop areas the trinity river great salmon and steal head area a has just so much wildlife\nAnd if you drive through hoop uh from willow creek you'll notice that there are more Barry bushes on the roadways and the surrounding mountains and I've ever seen anywhere in the world\nAnd there's this association with berries and big foot over the years that if you pay attention and you do the research something about that and I I I Know that they're seeing eating at a lot but it's just an odd coincidence\nDid you uh I don't want to get too deep into the woods I'm literally and figuratively but you can you summarize as a law man as a former law man at the state of the evidence about whether you'd say there is that there is there's sufficient evidence that something is real here or do we just haven't quite figured out\nSo several years of walking down that path I knew that DNA is the real answer to any solution of animal\nLife for human life and there were a series of people that I met on this journey that were absolutely ultra credible many of them didn't want to talk about it many of them didn't want to be visible about it but all of them said you were in on this let's let's get the DNA\nAnd George I gotta thank you that to many years ago you brought on and at my request a a a PHD name Melba catch them Dr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs tissue blood et cetera\nDr catch him was one of the few people in the world that was willing to go into the lab and DNA test hairs to shoot blood et cetera that we'd bring it on your show we said hey we need other samples from throughout North America to test to kind of get a cross section of what we're dealing with\nAnd that led to a hundred and ten samples being submitted a many of them were ... were hair and with the hair you need the follicle to get the mitochondrial DNA and then other people came forward with a tissue samples blood saliva\nAnd all of this noble work through incredibly well ah to figure out the solution and the chemical way to extract and read this DNA\nAnd the amazing part was is that we got nuclear DNA\nAnd what the showed was that the bypass it went back twelve to Fifteen thousand years on the female side to the ... Arab region to ah Jerusalem to a\nJordan into that part of the world and this was when I was sent to a gym bank and three hundred and fifty two billion base pairs of human DNA is in the ...\nAnd unbelievably Gen bank came back and said they can't find ever reading the male side of the equation\nAnd they wrote this up\nShe brought in three other PHD's super smart people to help her white a white paper about this\nAnd during that process of getting the DNA extracting the DNA one of the places that they used was Louisiana crime lab a completely automated process for extracting the DNA and getting it\nAnd there was no there was no way that this the samples could have been compromised\nYet as the paper was written by before I get there so they write as they're in the process of writing the paper a lot of people don't know this but you and I work together to introduce Melba too of very brilliant scientist who had written white papers before\nAnd we explained to her and he explained to her a proper way to go about this\nShe listen to some of this but she didn't listen to all of it and unfortunately she put a lot of feelings and thoughts don't belong in a white paper in a white paper\nBut if you extract all of those feelings and thoughts and you stick strictly with the science\nWhich people don't in Ninety nine percent of the people have never read the paper and they read little news briefs here and there and think it's the truth the reality is when you sit\nMarry a a very precise DNA kind of testing the paper that was written by Dr Melba catch them maybe had some personal I'm a observations that didn't belong in the paper but the\nThe DNA evidence David Was rock solid right\nWell that's the part that I don't think a lot of people understand it or if it wasn't some half ale treatment it was\nIt was the best of the best that DNA was sent to for certified lab so to ensure that there was no mistake all of the labs got the same results or it was analyzed by a series of people it was\nIt went through so many hurdles was unreal there's a there's a couple of outsiders right now doing research on DNA and you could see him on TV and they said oh you know the DNA is comeback bears et cetera\nAnd one of the things that nobody did that most researchers and DNA so called experts are not doing right now\nIs that when the hair samples came in they went to a hair and fiber expert before they went to NA to ensure that they came back as big foot her\nThat people are saying going to say well how do you know that's a big for their\nWell ... looks different than any other mammal hair in the world and I could teach anybody in five minutes to look at a big foot her and tell the physical difference under a microscope between that and other hairs hair and fiber experts have a graph of all the different mammal hairs in North America\nAnd when you look at a big but here it's an entirely different\nSo if it if the hair didn't jump through that hurdle and never went on to DNA\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using the hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it\nBut if you pay attention to all of these DNA experts are not using their hair and fiber expert even look at and ensure that what they're dealing with it is the real deal [noise]\nSo and I don't think some of these so called DNA experts have figured out the formula that Melba did to extract this DNA and to get the results\nAnd there's a lotta there's a lotta attitude in this arena as you know George and it's unfortunate that people won't put down their defenses and all work together and it almost seems at times that there's something else behind the scenes\nThat's ensuring that they don't want to get those results\nWell it's going to like to UFO world I mean people are very passionate but they're also very bitter conscious and you have a certain element of people who takes their take their passion to different levels um to the point of\nRoger let 'em material um and ah will stab people in the back and will sabotage others uh the DNA evidence ... at a minimum\nUm people were able to dismiss it because it has elements of humans in it right so they'd say well it's humid but it's not all you\nKnow and that's that's the part of a second says it looks like it's a hybrid human um it's unusual but it's it's way far down that humans spectrum I'm I I think the most unusual part\nThat everyone was stunned about was that the nuclear DNA couldn't come back with the human match on gender thing and when you look at that you've got to think well that means number one that Gen bank has never had a sample in the world submitted\nOther than ours and how could that be\nUm we we used we we sat down as a group many times and tried to be smart about how we got this DNA and luckily on a couple of occasions a farmer had some pipes break an irrigation pipe and it was kind of surmise that\nSay a six foot section of pipe was purposely broken on on each and six feet apart\nBecause it appeared that a big foot was trying to get some kind of animal that within the pipes some kinda rodent or something and when he broke the PVC pipe and bled on it well we got the DNA off that other times it licked game camera we got that\nAnd there were there was a tissue sample we got that and then over a hundred hair samples that had a follicle that all match this big foot look when you view it under a microscope\nNow Ninety nine point nine percent of the time when I get approached about this\nThat people haven't read the study they've read a newspaper article or someone's opinion and they believe it\nAnd they refused to get into the minutia of the data and read the report because it's available online and see that the hurdles that we went through to make sure that this was true an accurate I give all the credit to Melba she's a genius scientists that figure this out\nUm it's unfortunate\nYeah because it got down to Rona under the under the bus as she did as well um ... you said that the this this was not engine bank is it now or did they toss it out\nThey wouldn't take it ...\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these\nAnd\nLet's go to your book big wild man and giants I mean a lot of times you know these descriptions and there's some amazing working here there's some really\nA tremendous writing in some of these old articles a from a long time ago but um and some of them are pretty hilarious and in reading and often making fun of the witnesses as well\nBut these things are the three different categories you have in the title they're all sort of blended together although there are some very important distinctions between the the three and they go way way back sixteen eight\nOh did you how did you find all these\nSo ... again it was just me searching for old cases on missing people that seemed to miss that fit that profile but we were looking for\nBut then when I had this giant stack of articles kind of the breakdown of of the way the articles were worded\nIs two hundred and two of the articles used wild man as the description twenty four used ape gorilla or monkey Ninety eight used giants and forty use something else now the articles the way they broke down on geographical is a hundred and fifty eight we're in the U. S. sixteen and Canada\nThree and hungry ... three in the Himalayas er Nepal and three in the u._k. there were others but those were the both of them and then the states with the most articles about it\nA whirl Ohio with Twenty one Pennsylvania Thirteen California eleven Indiana eleven New York nine Georgia nine Kentucky in Texas six and then the numbers keep going down from there but\nAgain it wasn't I wasn't looking for these and\nThey weren't associated with a missing persons articles they just would have visibility on a front page along with a new article and the missing\nBut I started to pay attention and I got to give some credit to a guy named Tom Powell Oregon Tom's a brilliant guy good researcher and he started to make the connection between giants in Bigfoot\nAnd one of the funniest things he did in his presentations his genius\nIs a lot of people say oh you know if you're overlay this map with the maps of the foot wild man disappearances there all the same and he puts up a map of like Bigfoot the ah appearances and UFO appearances and\nThen he does some where all the you know the amount of rain in certain areas associated and and he goes out like six maps and then he puts up a map and he doesn't say anything because you know what this map of because it was a map of all the Wal Mart stores in the U.S can you see how\nThey're kind of associated the same location that's the big fight [laughter] and but it was his statement about giants that were found in past centuries\nIn mountains and in a excavations they're really kind of got me thinking or these giants the big for that were buried or where the something else and how come they're more there aren't more giants that we can go see it museums and things where are they\nYeah I've asked that question I'm really interested in the subject in part because there are some of those stories here in Nevada you know the ... and showing the legends and stories about the big foot bones or a giant bones that were stashed in the game up in northern Nevada and Ah yes what happened to the bones and nobody can seem to find them\nWell why did these articles pointed to a some universities would get 'em but the the more likely candidates were all these went and it said in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the ...\nLikely candidate where all these went and it's set in the articles was the Smithsonian yet nobody can go back and find them now and the Smithsonian claims they don't have them\nYou look back and some of the descriptions there's one early in your book it's from the Marilyn that June twenty seven Seventeen Ninety three describing an account or a witness sees this on the ... of a rubber an animal\nBetween twelve and fifteens deed Hi it's a shape resembling a human except the head with it which is an equal proportion to the body\nThe seats are two feet long and Harry\nUh that sounds like our guy doesn't mean the description so Mike modern descriptions of big but\nSo when I found these these articles from the Seventeen hundreds and I was stunned because nobody talks about it\nBut when you like one of the quotes in that article says this animal is between twelve and Fifteen feet high and in shape resembling a human being except the head which is like you said an equal proportion to the body and so I'm thinking wow they were writing about this way back when and\nResources this message sponsored by the Nevada department of health and Human Services aired in cooperation with the Nevada broadcasters association and ...\nI'm Aaron tailor the real estate guy might help Nevada residents buy and sell over five thousand homes since Nineteen Ninety four\nForty eight realty is proud to partner with the Nevada broadcasters association in recognizing the Nevada military support alliance Nevada servicemen and women are battle born and often stand in harm's way to fight for our freedom was dumb giving the ultimate sacrifice mayor and Taylor the real estate guy and I am Nevada proud sponsored by ...\nFor the better broadcasters association in this day should from the justice a hard ... studios ... north Las Vegas ...

I I have never heard of a hunter say oh yeah I had to kill this thing I shot it in the head or it it looked like an animal I've not heard that and I've heard the human side of it from a fireman\nA policeman credible credible sources that continually say the same thing and it isn't just one time in history goes way back in history or so there's something to this they got got askew where they said they started looking like him or apes than animals and\nAs you know Georgia's this segment of the big foot world that wants to go out and kill one and\nI don't have any idea why they think they need to kill one maybe some kind of over load on testosterone but they they should wake up to the reality they're never going to kill one it's not going to happen\nThere are some are reports of where these people claimed to have killed one or they've captured a wild man and they brought him back somewhere on the ship or they've got him in jail and they invariably he gets away or the evidence disappears however\nYeah and uh probably the one case in you know about it the Minnesota Wild man\nThat has a lot of injury to it because I've seen pictures of it and I've seen descriptions of it and it is unusual and nobody quite knows what happens to it but a lot of people just poo poo it and say oh you know it was that was a fake meant for the circus\nAnd nobody quite knows what happens to it but a lot of people just cuckoo it fail you know was that was a fake meant for the circus but the more you dig into that one there was something strange with that\nWell I find myself rooting for the wild man or whatever it is to get away and all these cases so I'm Glad it ends up that way you know you look at where are these reports come from there from major these are major newspapers too I mean the Boston Globe and the San Francisco newspaper LA Times ah\nAnd they ... and it's some great writing some of these descriptions is just terrific writing\nIt it's somebody wasn't just phony get in a when they were working on this story and the fact that they come from places like Indiana and Iowa and Kansas\nA that's not where we associate big foot sightings modern sightings at all is trying to think of why would Ohio in Pennsylvania will be so prominent in the numbers and it's because\nI mean that was the center of American civilization and is Seventeen hundreds or so Seventeen eighties where the bigger cities where it wasn't exactly the frontier because there are people out here as well but\nUh that's where the bulk of the population probably lived time\nOh exactly and it's a a it's an interesting phenomenon when you start to work at the fighting locations in conjunction to the giants sightings and skeletons and then if you go back in history and you think about exactly what you said where did we first established civilization\nAnd cities that as we move west where were these locations but then even though we're thing to me is\nOhio has a lot of these sightings well that's Bruce Maccabee with Ohio he's a friend and I went to spend four or five days with him earlier this year and the strange things that he's told me\nThat have happened in Ohio in the air and on the ground it's really strange [laughter]\nBruce Mac it'd be a is welcome here anytime he is a fascinating guy are both in person and on the air and in his books or you know it was kind of surprising to see the early reports from Hungary I'd never heard of Hungarian big butter sasquatch reports until reading this book of yours\nI'd never heard of him either and a\nAgain a surprising surprising fact that they're writing about it from there and then in the ... they there's an article from there about a citing ... when you look at the descriptions that they're offering almost identical to what they're seeing here in the U.S at the same time period or thereabouts\nAnd then when you think about president day fighting's again from on almost every continent in the world which is unusual\nUm you know some of the descriptions obviously you have to take him in a cultural context now I don't remember when the jungle book was written but ... the character Mobley um you know he's described that description is used in a couple of the newspaper clippings from that era that that you've collected here\nCorrect and er I people always tell me well what about the star wars creature that looks like Bigfoot and how it's kind of strange\nThan it was inspired by maybe yeah I don't know it's it it's a similarity\nUm some of the descriptions I guess I Would have to live through it here to find one but it seems like the witnesses are saying that the wild men have clothes or items of clothing or just a ... kind of a thing which suggests to me maybe they were humans maybe read they really were literally wild men out there\nWell then usually and occasionally even nowadays\nReally we're literally wild men out there well then usually\nAnd occasionally even nowadays you hear about it for wearing clothing and kind of goes unexplainable because why would they do that but you know maybe it's\nSome association maybe they're trying to break a barrier if they're seen maybe they think there'll be accepted more if they're seen maybe people won't be so scared you know we could all thrown our conjecture about why that may be happening but\nHappens too often for people to be fabricating it I I hear it occasionally but not very often\nUm if you were to communicate with the tribe these days a ... a modern tribe that would still perhaps be in contact other than the hope is is are there any other tribes he would say people that have a relationship one going with the whatever these things are\nI Would say it's almost every one\nI mean there's there's famous stories out of Arizona New Mexico and the high plains out there where uh they have these and there's many times in association between and this is where they put people start their head start spending that fact\nWe're there's this association between big foot in UFOs\nEven in the book I wrote that many of the tribal people said that they saw a UFO and close time and space to the point where they saw big foot and they regularly saw UFOs on many of the tribal grounds\nAnd when you talk to these tribal members The Elders they believe they came from the stars\nAnd they're they're not once they have your trust that will tell you hey you know there's this association between us and them and they're a different kind of try and different kinds of people but they came from the same place we did\nAnd when you start to go back and you look at the history of the certain areas there's a lot of tribal people that will tell you we've had visitations for hundreds and hundreds of years going back in time and almost all of them believe that they came from the stars\nWell there are an awful lot of associations between these creatures being cited in in proximity to UFOs and it makes everyone uncomfortable the big but people the diehards don't like it\nThe UFO diehards like it even less than they they're not comfortable with that at all but you have to follow it where it leads and you know I I don't have a conviction on it either I don't know what these things are in the wake you up those are where they're from\nBut um there was enough cases over the centuries and a lot more of them now thanks to this new book\nYou can't ignore it I thought the ... there was a couple of stories clippings where there are reputable witnesses who say they saw these creatures\nAre engaging with cow's milking cows\nSo this is the part that really really is unusual several years ago one of my best friends their parents on a dairy farm unless they're talking to him about this and I said you know I I keep reading that\nThey may be milking cows you know what do you think about that because you know I'm going to talk to my parents\nSo they own a huge dairy farm and he went out there and talk to them in this all this I think he's eighty years old this guy's dad and he looked at him and he said you know every once in a while my cat will come back from nowhere completely milked\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter]\nFor the wall Mike how will come back from nowhere completely though\nHe goes I don't understand it [laughter] and then the fame man told him he says you know\nEvery once in a while I'm On the far corner my property and something tells me don't turn around\nGet back on the horse or get back on my TV and leave and he does and then the man said well you know every once in a while I found a bucket way out in the corner of the property I don't know how it got their\nSo called dogs [laughter] I I think when you get the trust somebody to dairy farmers way out in the middle they are going to tell you the same thing 'cause I've heard it many times\nUm you know there are some funny stories I they're not in this book but I've recalled I think you and I have talked about before about big what are what they eat and they'll you know they're at a particular this image of a big foot milking a cow a sticks in my head but I mean they've been known to eat a lot of berries and different kinds of fruit\nUm do they eat meat as far as you know\nAccording to the tribal people who are seen them take deer et cetera they're an omnivore and many times when the natives are in the\n[noise]\nRight here we go calls for my guess Dave ... first time caller Gwen in Pittsburgh Hi Gwen\nOh man I'm thank you for letting me on your show first of all welcome\nBack involved David I have had many sleepless nights listening to everything about the missing persons like it is one of the most unsettling thing that I've heard in a long time [laughter]\nSo good job on your finding 'em I wanted to talk about the big thing I actually think you're I really love how you're saying it how it's related to wild man\nI'm I feel like Rome or off of that way that we can find out more about wild land because there are Amazonian tribe that were just discovered like for the first time with your own and I feel like\nYour idea of revolutionary and I feel like within the next ten years will definitely have an answer because of their own and my question he is he's like you're going to use drones in your research at all\nSo drones are an interesting topic but uh there was actually some a PHD level people that thought the drones were going to be good for finding if that that was a complete bomb\nSo a drones are never going to work for a big topic the missing people topic they have used drones before on missing people uh hasn't worked real well and you can't use a drone international park it's against the wall and there's a huge fine so probably won't happen\nThat George Bush going to the next call I had a question for you and maybe you should have kind of touch on it for the people here\nYour work on skin Walker ranch the researchers there saw something very similar to a big ... can you tell us about that\nActually multiple times ah it's more of the tribe that that encounters them they'd seen them there as long as they lived there there was a very dramatic instance I've got the transcripts of the interviews with the officers\nAnd we went to the spot where it happened but the the dogs there were police officers are patrolling tribal rounds they have a gift shop that's just off the highway there on the reservation and\nUh the dogs alerted the officers to this huge thing that was a just outside the window and as soon as the dog's made a noise and the this thing looked at the officers and showing a light on it it took off running and it went all the way through the community\nAnd you could hear it it ... I mean it was just taking these giant stride it knocked over garbage cans you had alarms going off then that the police officers chased it\nAh I think they they found some tracks it led to a there's a reservoir there this just on the other side of skin Walker ranch and that's where they lost that it just kind of sort of disappeared or they are seen similar creatures on the ranch itself\nI'm I shouldn't call it big but it's more like humanoid and there's one particular instance that we've described on the program before where these two scientists and to other people who were observers up on skin Walker rigid seen what looked like a dirty snowball of light that uh that was floating just off the\nOff the ground in the middle homestead there on the ranch in it and through infrared you can see the the bowl of light started stretching into what looked like a tunnel and through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited\nIt's stretching into what looked like a tunnel and through this tunnel this creature started crawling they could see it it can you guys these guys were really excited seeing this thing is coming from somewhere else in this tunnel of light ... through struggling to get through this skinny little opening it pulls itself out\nAt the er\nAt the entrance to this uh this tunnel stands up it's eight feet tall I'm Peter list dark humanoid shaped like ahead with no neck on a on a body\nJust stands up and then starts moving up towards getting Walker ridge where these guys are watching it and they can tell ya they got the hell out of there they were pretty scared about the whole thing but are there have been multiple sightings of that by humans by um scientists by dogs uh\nUh the the tribe has the best a handle on it and um I've seen it all over the you went to Beijing so yeah it's pretty common in that area and and of course it's in proximity to a lot of other really strange stuff so you have to ask the question about what is the association between these creatures\nAre that are described in many different ways and a lot of other very unusual\nPhenomena and we don't know um\nWest of the Rockies Kyle in Utah I Kyle welcome to the program\nHow you doing All right so in your mind so\n[noise] so I had um you're talking about David Was talking about Joseph ... Smith the ones you talk to keen on his saddle\nUm he thought Bigfoot it happened in Eighteen [noise] ah oh five of us are Eighteen thirty five he was on his way to another ... light in the ... the prophet\nAnd he ... he ran into a cane and uh he described Cain as the as a tall a figure that was taller than his saddle\nAnd ah just to fill the fifth talked a cane and the heat and Kaine introduced this though is that I'm a man\nI'm pursuing wander here and there and I might go will basically he she wanted to make men misery or the destroyed their souls\nYou brought that up I just thought in Mormon culture LVS coach or that we have you know there's two story that are really famous that story than just killing Smith who is Joseph Smith nephew you\nHis brother had an encounter with Wesley Smith a in Hawaii at the dedication and the lady Hawaii temple of ... in Nineteen Twenty one uh came came to read the doors of the temple and I'm In his hand or\nA Wesley Smith said that he that was the priesthood to cast came out and somebody was his hand and they just crashed a cashier and king [noise] and so it's interesting you say that we can and art church you know like some people who are skeptical I ate there kind of hush hush let's talk about it\nBut as people continue to go on you know um there are more accepted but I just wanted for David like with the disappearances 'cause I've been reading his book for a little while and stuff\nI Do think it's it's a big foot and he said he can he does he have any idea what's going on 'cause like people are asking me you know like people don't need to kind of have an interest in a little bit of this stuff\nWell let me tell you a coyote let everyone listening here to tonight is probably the the weirdo expert in their family and then there are ... social circle\nA you and uh and everyone listening is likely they go to person in their own circles for information about these kind of topics Dave or to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big\nTheir own circles more information about these kind of topics they are to begin with the Joseph Smith story is that a is that likely a big what type encounter or is that something else\nWill the description that the Smith gave was would match Bigfoot but then there's there's people who are researching this topic who believe that the big foot may be some night some type of the film\nThe Bible and when you read that there is some association there that makes some sense now Scott Carpenter another researcher in the world has written a book about this it's compelling and there's there's some strong evidence that he's come across that may joined the two topics\nAnd the other things like in the Smith incident the part that's unusual is that it came and it spoke to him and he never said it mind spoke but more like it spoke to them so hard to say I don't know but one thing like this gentleman asked about my thoughts and things\nI've always stated that I'm a man of facts\nAll of my books are filled with facts there aren't any opinions about what's going on I allow you to come to your own opinion and why do I do that because there are no facts to to establish any current pattern that points to one suspect\nWhen you look at the big foot world there's nothing that points to an exact equation of what we're dealing with other than the DNA\nBut again if you stick with the facts and allow the public to come to their own thoughts I have never met anybody who's read my eight books and they have been thousands that has come to me and said I Know exactly what's happening\nDoesn't [laughter]\nAnd I should point out that you know you did to address this may be crowded and hear it but there are no credible stories in your view of big what being responsible for recording people as far as you know\nWell no no killing them I I think only okay there's there's a story that John Green wrote about a a prospect or that was taken in British Columbia where he took an affidavit from this man\nAnd he was sleeping in a sleeping bag and one of these by pitch grabbed his bag and started walking with him for hours and ended up dumped put him in a cave and he was eventually escaped but he said he saw this family of big foot in the cave and they kind of watched him and he kind of watch them\nA it's a it's a really really good story who and the individual at the time sign an affidavit\nI followed greens lead and said this is a good way to document the stories I hear and that's kinda how came came to pass\nI remember that story now yeah that is a good one isn't there some other account in one of your books about a witness claiming to see a big what type creature carrying a person\nThrough the forest and ring a bell yeah so there's this", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "22"}
