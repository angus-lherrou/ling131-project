including the cycle mantey him which was popularized by or different of ramen moody the originator of the term\nNear death experience and let us bring in Joshua ... worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight is Halloween the event oh I Love it or we're going to\nDig into this extremely creepy thing is like a man the mirrors I also have an update for you\nAbout time warps in UFOs or later on we are going to give away from free tickets to my big event in Los Angeles this Saturday a there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with your\nJob and the way I'm bumped because I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of be will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank you\nYou got that right or the cycle meant the it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me\nAnd the number of other people in person in the ... technique um and it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh local newspaper and I found again and again when I go into a haunted place someone would take me into\nIt's quite quite young for the or a local newspaper and I found again and again when I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and said this is the most talented room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other [noise]\nUh it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena um there are a number of possible explanations for this for one\nThing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel rank like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates has some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a mirror what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of these spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people used to cry by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand that I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like state none of them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of your head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho man the ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts\nEight of time that could be days where he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find that reminds you of her any pictures and he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through now when this become is\nVery scary if when you have people who experiment or you know people talk about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble\nAnd stronger thing yeah you have people who go in there and they just say I don't care I just want to see something and when you go in there with that attitude that's a ...\nYou you are well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a cycle Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact uh over the years I've done many experiments where it was set up a camera to see if we can record the experience\nAnd sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair [noise] and so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli de left in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a lot of people ... it is a lot of people yeah I I started doing this a long time even before I met Dr moody\nAnd a three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent\nBut I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full on\nThat's dramatic Josh with us we'll come back and talk about time warps in some UFOs here's our first emerging artists Paul Rubin from Santa Barbara California was a song called winter when\n[noise] I did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast\nAm shooting them before I even did it [laughter] and I know that\nThat that sounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have this new piece of technology aren't going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said we're of course that plays turned out to the area fifty\n... Las Vegas\nOutside of Las Vegas Nevada and um I I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me\nUm it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it it was a Newsweek inside edition and ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme\nUFO hot spots in the state were incredible footage has been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred\nAnd so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with your George and um I mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way a very cool that you played a a a group\nFrom Ashville North Carolina great group\n[laughter] you know ... my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play an Ashville group but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context\nOkay um and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just coincidence\nAre we just seeing different facets of a larger project that as sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to view it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence ...\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does of Jordan new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip\nSo that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut there was not there was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times so I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get\nThe scoop uh and this was a program that was a course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada to keep that in mind\nUh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow\n[noise] now later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this\nTime work it which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force\nSo here I Am next area fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced as there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time George nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state\nOf Nevada and they're good one\nHe is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings he goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons\nFindings he goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and the standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient\nHe goes on to say even more and this is the one that really gets me associated exotic now that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies\nLikely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory ... and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries\nAn unusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here\nSo he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified live independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered an exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's why we need we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries\nAnd you call it exotic where could have possibly come from um I also wanted to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to this where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project in some of these topics this thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity waves communication work drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication\nUltra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight redacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there's one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... with which July twenty fifth\nRight so that said now we move up to August\nAugust of twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville George ... the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with them and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beach to a nail us air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore yes when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space forced\nSo that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology that is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry\nIt's some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if

because the word has now spread for so long that if you go to see how you have to be respectful people now take it seriously\nAnd I don't think that there are nearly as many people who are going to see him now who are having bad experiences or even paranormal experiences because he seems to be at peace\nAnd I think it's in part\nThanks to people like you George you know you inspired me and gave me the opportunity to go down there to Key West and uh almost ten years ago and to do live reports and to really dig into this and I you may or may not recall George I actually called into the show\nI realized you know live it was just me and Robert and the whole place just the two of us was a creepy yes it is great [laughter] gala\nI mean just anybody who's never seen Robert The dog just go look him up you know on a just type in Robert but all Google and you know you can see he's a creepy looking guy but from the moment I got there I was respectful\nI ask permission if you go to my Web site you can click around and find some of my video that I shot you know from the moment that I actually met Robin\nHis profession if you go to my Web site you can click around and find some of my video that I shot you know from the moment that I actually met Robert ... and I said look I'm Joshua pie Warren\nI have come here to understand you I'm going to report on what I find to a lot of people I'm asking for your permission and blah blah blah\nAnd so I think Robert Knight got along very well and uh so I think you should also rest assured George that you played a big role probably\nAnd helping to educate people that there is something bad happens to you if you're disrespectful to this stall and if you're nice of adult then you have nothing to worry about so I think he is much happier so to speak than ever\nNow originally to win the dome was first given to the family years ago didn't people see the ... like in the window or running back and forth and weird stuff like that well\nYou know the the weirdest thing creepy his thing about the story of Robert The haunted Dahl is that he was given to a young boy a Robert Eugene auto which everybody called Eugene\nOre gene and gene\nBecame obsessed with this dog when gene was only like maybe four or five years old\nAnd then Jean grew up to be\nA very you know successful man I had had a wife that everybody loves had a nice big house but it didn't change is infatuation with the dog\nI mean uh you might think back when you were a kid maybe there was some point that was special to you and then there came a point when it just sort of drifted away that never happened for gene auto he kept this\nThis uh ... uh till the end of his wife and treated in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room\nSo are his room was essentially moved to the attic at at the wife's insistence but you know they claimed that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house in the house that their abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a fire to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in that house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community said at night you could sometimes walk outside the windows and you'd look up\nA new new that house was really one new there ever read see little Robert The do running around the house George Back and forth in front of the windows\nI Love that next up let's go to the time or in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for Tyler Tyler welcome to the program\nHey how you doing good good to be with us\nSo a Joshua I was a up on the blue ridge parkway about\nFourteen years ago it was around uh August and I've spirits who crazy life on to make it to make a brief I was up a around like black Baltimore area me and my friends were just hanging out up there\nAnd then all of a sudden like this huge deep dark fog just kind of swept in in the afternoon like we're watching the ... all of a sudden it's super thick fog just said is\nThere were like six to eight what looked to be like jeep headlights off in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading right are are like right at us\nEd lights off in the distance thought nothing of it about five to ten minutes later they started heading right are are like right at us we've got to thinking about it we're at and overlooked there was no way that could have been linked jeeps or anything\nWe started watching them in like this belief at this point they get right upon us about two hundred feet away and then they dislike broke apart and just started like bugs and all around and we took off um come to find it like for two years I thought I was crazy me and my two friends were like what that was that\nWhat's going on out there where you Josh\n... it was it was the wild stuff and then uh about a year or two later my my buddy sent me a link it might have been from your website or something talking about it\nAnd uh it just like connected the dots I've I've been really trying to contact you but we're not trying but no one to talk to you for about twelve years now to just see what you think about it\nWhat is that Josh\nWell Tyler thank you for that call always good to talk to a fellow Ashville yet another Tar Heel and um you know right on that in North Carolina you know everybody of course focuses on brown mountains or the brown mountain lights because the brown mountain lights are the most famous example\nYou've talked about them before Josh\nYeah of of this strange phenomenon where you have these balls of life that appear but actually this is widespread this goes beyond brown mountain\nThis goes all over as Tyler was saying the blue Ridge Mountains and ah you know the which is of course the part of the Appalachian chain Lena leading over to the great Smoky Mountains there are all kinds of spots where these balls of light appear now I Believe that [noise]\nIf you I mean if you if you really want to get the scoop on this you can download a free PDF about it if you go to brown mountain whites dot com\nBut basically an eye on that website but um but what I can tell you is that there are places on earth that produce an incredible amount of natural energy\nAnd that that energy has as a byproduct of bunch of paranormal activity that spins off so you get more ghostly encounter is people seeing UFOs time slips scripted all that kind of stuff but in its role as form\nIt's almost like Marie idioms on planet earth that acupuncture is might compare to the ... of energy that flow on a human body\nThese are places that conduct electricity and when that electricity manifest and interacts at in certain angles at certain cliffs it can create what similar to to ball lightening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy\nAround western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and so we're still uncertain as to whether or not these balls of white\nAre just merely and simply a raw natural phenomenon like ball lightening or they might also have some sense of intelligence and ah this is what makes this such a great mystery\nJoshua his

we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you were originally get started in pure normal investigating what was that one catalyst that got you into\nIt [noise] oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um 'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids\nAnd my dad is one of seven kids while and I both both sides of my family they've been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds [noise]\nUh but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of it\nA late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds\nA but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Callaway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties uh named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture developed my great uncle clog Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they weren't not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a claud was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tells\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to clog called didn't answer\nAnd when the lunch was ready jak went outside and I'm here has claws magazine lying on the porch but there's no claws and a long story short my great uncle clogged Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nShe I'm David ladies involved in the sun\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national uh\nPart these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow my great uncle who was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of the story\nAnd reading a magazine ... how could he have disappeared was he abducted was the rapture way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I've verify the whole story with\nElderly people and ah historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family or they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound this created\nAnd it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that\nThere's something very real that we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was when I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own two wives\nWho drew you let's go to the final goals here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI my ... is no way to go go ahead and I was one it was it\nWill also said yes and how does that relate to how\nI like earth is November ... if you will go go ahead and that was long it will it will\nAlso said yes and how does that relate to how all souls and Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth my mother's birthday is November the third the\nDay after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months that takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on\nWhich of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe\nAnd trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first\nUm some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback which would be November the first and so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween and so then uh they sort of combined the pig and beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first and\nThen of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate saints but just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day um but this is one of those are interesting examples it goes back to you know Christmas\nWe're going to be hearing more stories about this and uh probably is Christmas approaches where\nYoure driving blind life is worth more than a tax stay alive don't text and

wouldn't press the issue on a writer right away but then later he talks to her and he brought out a book of weaponry and and uniforms in and asked her to look through it and identify what she saw\nAnd he claims that she had no access to any World War two history books she truck he tried to keep that away from her because she was so young but then she began to describe the guns that were there the uniforms that were there and they all matched or what\nCould have been in that bunker at that time so you do have stories like that from a pretty credible sources that they've had these experiences in Normandy and that certainly wasn't the only one that happened in those bunkers\nThe other place that uh I talked to a German goes tonner and his name's Tom put do and he told me that uh he investigated the art dance battlefield which is in in Germany or near Germany\nA and a site of the battle of the bulge\nAnd ah he claims to have encountered a lot of weird activity there and he considers that area one of the most haunted places in Europe he also said that uh the concentration camps are extremely haunted but out of honor and respect for those\nThe dead there he refuses to investigate he's just heard a lot of stories and uh likewise I decided to leave any stories about the concentration camps ... out of my book too\nYeah that's too emotional yeah too much what\nWould you say your some of the most dramatic stories that you put it in the book\n[noise] some of the most dramatic story I mean every chapters riveting I got to say\nOh I appreciate that the one that moves me the most I found were the stories that happened uh uh in the Pacific theater and again when you're talking about World War two you're talking about a global conflicts so these ghost stories crop up literally\nEverywhere yeah a ... in Okinawa was that was the one story that stood out for me a and there's a story about a group of civilians who are committed suicide or en masse right after the the American invasion of\nOkinawa and just a little like heaven's gate or something like that\nWell it wasn't exactly like that or the story is uh that the Japanese military knew that Okinawa was kind of the last\nFour ... they had a ... in the Pacific if the Americans took over outcome Okinawa they would build an airbase in that air base would bring\nA most of Japan or easily into the range of their of of the American bombers so what the Japanese did was they spread stories to the civilians that if the Americans invaded they would torture kill and you know God Knows\nWhat else civilians are enslave them scare the living daylights right\nAbsolutely terrified to when the Americans did invade the ah civilians were would run off the cliffs and commit suicide and then you know that's a documented piece of history just a terrifying uh a story but now it\nYou know that's a documented piece of history\nJust a terrifying uh a story but now it there are stories a one story in particular that rate of that I wrote about in the book is that a group of tourists were had a peace museum near those cliffs\nAnd they were walking in a field near that that museum\nAnd they heard the sound of what they considered they said it was almost like a herd of of footsteps coming their way and they couldn't see anything\nAnd then they felt a wind pass them and then later heard what they described as cries and screams so\nThat was pretty moving for me\nUm another story from the Pacific he would Jima is is equally um heartbreaking and\nHe would Jima it there are literally thousands of Japanese soldiers that were probably buried alive because they were ... they were a in a tunnel system a very intricate\nTunnel system under the island and um the the entrances caved in or or or the soldiers were actually burned alive or in the tunnels\nSo there's a story that I write about that one\nA Japanese civilian worker claims that every time he gets a call that he has to return to the mainland in any\nWay he gets a knock on the door\nAnd he claims that these spirits of these soldiers on wood Jima that want to be repatriated back to the to the mainland and Japan so those are some pretty intense stories that a crop up and it's ... they're certainly not rare uh in in this volume middle\nEast what's interesting to map is that they seem to be so prevalent all over the place something's going on\nYeah that's true and not only are they everywhere that the different one of the amazing aspects of of the world war two supernatural is that the gifts don't even necessarily have to be people because there's actually goes planes that appear especially over England\nAlmost like the flying dutchman the ship\nYeah absolutely exactly\nPeople see these planes and they're really not there\nYeah this is um and and I'll tell you a little story from my own\nFamily do they hear them too\nWell some do and some don't but there's one area or in the United kingdom um [noise]\nUh it's a northern section of of the u._k. called derby sheer\nAnd it's known as the Bermuda Triangle of um the u._k. it it sounds pretty pastoral sounding so I don't know why there's such activity but there have been a lot of plane crashes there about fifty planes I think if have crashed in that area\nAnd it has quite a reputation but over the years there have been what they called ghost playing flaps\nSo for example in Nineteen eighty five\nA bunch of people a claim to seeing this huge military aircraft flying overhead one couple was I'm\nDriving down the highway\nAnd they sold this very low flying bomber cruising over the highway a and they said that it didn't have any sound whatsoever which was remarkable because it was so big and I you know I think they described it as a a for prop ... engine and it looked like a World War two bomber\nSo of course skeptics believe that it was probably you know a either a current military plane or possibly a um maybe uh\nThe you know either a current military plane or possibly a um maybe a\nA bomb or going to an air show or something like that was what they don't want they thought you know\nYou write but to counter that a lot of these people that solve this first of all\nThere didn't seem to be a pattern or a flight with with this there didn't seem to be a straight line as you might see with a a a a a regular conventional non spooky aircraft disappeared in different areas throughout that region\nAnd a couple of the people that spotted this one in particular worked uh\nFor a an airfield during World War two was ... I Believe I'm\nA somewhat a flight mechanic for the for the uh R. E. F. so definitely would have known the difference between let's say a modern\nI guess like a Hercules aircraft and something like a B. twenty four or uh Lancaster Bomber and and this person described it either as a Lancaster or is it be twenty four bomber\nSo a pretty peculiar and and there have been other what they call goes plane flaps\nA throughout history and I think there was even one\nAs I was writing this book so to thousands Seventeen um pretty interesting\nMathieu did they describe how the planes would disappear how would how how they would leave\nIf the one couple just said that it flew overhead and they thought it was gonna crash and I believe they pulled over to see you know see if it did crash or at least to hear it and it just it just kind of disappeared\nJust like that yeah yeah like you want to do a different time war or something right\nIn and the reason I looked into the these are a ghost planes stories is when I was young\nMy parents woke up early one morning it was a sort of a misty foggy morning and um they went for their morning walk and my parents came back in and said that as they were\nStarting their walk they saw an absolutely huge aircraft coming down just a few hundred feet off the ground and it was very foggy or you can make it sound went overhead and it just kind of disappeared into the mess that would be Erie\nThat watch it with my mom was still telling that story over and over and that's what made me think well\nEngland was just a huge aircraft carrier back in World War two I wondered whether they had any any story similar and sure enough it's a it's not that it happens all the time but it it's certainly a rather common occurrence for these goes planes to be seen\nI've been the handles hundreds and we're going to come back and talk more about haunted World War two next hour you'll share your questions and stories on\nI think everybody should use him either in fact I tell everybody jeeze I'm In my\nHome advisors a total

tell you what a a moving experiences and again we we think about that idea that somehow the power of that event has etched itself into the time and space around Pearl Harbor and the stories that are have been told about that a famous areas\nIt's around Pearl Harbor and the ghost stories that are have been told about that a famous area or are pretty extensive\nThere's one story of a of a sailor who apparently left\nHis watch on the USS Arizona ah just briefly and then ah during that time where he left the ship it was attacked and and sunk and now there's this story of this for Lauren looking sailor\nStanding at the uh standing at the edge of the the memorial kind of looking out into the bay where the Arizona now rafts a so that goes story has been told a quite a bit um [noise] excuse me ha\nThere's also a story of a of all of one lady who took a picture just of the memorial and of course uh the waves and the memorial and then when she looked at it\nThere seem to be faces in them into the picture\nIs a very uh in that went on online throughout and not only is the area Pearl Harbor the harbor itself haunted with therapy and go stories at places like the show field barracks and hit them airbase areas that were a part of the the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor\nAnd one place in particular in heck I'm a there was the headquarters building that\nUh supposedly served as a morgue after the attack and had some two hundred three hundred bodies in it and the places so haunted they said that they moved to\nThe sea cue desk which is usually inside the building they sit now say they post the guards outside of the building because of all the complaints that the soldiers had of this ghostly activity the sound of people running up and down steps to such a degree that are the steps the staircase itself would shake\nSo it's a it's a pretty haunted place\nThe desert Fox rumble or the the Nazi hands are thank leader and some incredible things happened to him to you died in Nineteen forty four mhm but what does he still haunts\nWas that's probably the most interesting a story that I found a a when I when I started to research this book because I I did initially looks to see if I could find the\nThe ghosts of a lot of famous general's pat and Eisenhower as well as some of the the axis powers or and or when Romney has always been a kind of a subject of fascination for me so I started to you know try to find if there were any ghost stories about him\nUh I I thought he might be found in North Africa which is where he gained much of his fame as the desert Fox maybe on the shores of Normandy he would be among those many goes that appear in Normandy he was really behind a\nA architecture the development of the fortifications there are in the constructions of the defenses along with what was considered the their Atlantic Wall\nOr maybe he would be in Germany but I actually found ghost stories about ... in the United states believe it or not\nSo one of the places as mount Hebron cemetery and Winchester, Virginia people claim to see this a figure\nA long trench coat a cap on a looking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the the graves or he's seen it the graves of some of\nLooking over the graves and and there are some people who say that he is actually at the\nThe graves or he's seen it the graves of some of patents a general patents ancestors and then there's a A N in West Virginia where they claimed that Romney will haunt so what's the story behind that there is a story that\nAre between the wars ... along with a few other\nGerman generals traveled on a secret trip to America to visit some of the ... the battlefields of the civil war particularly they were looking at the way that Stonewall Jackson maneuver through the Shenandoah Valley so this is why this\nThat uh Irwin Ramos haunts these areas is is around today they think that uh he has left his spirit here because he once once visited the site now is there any historical basis for this\nI haven't been able to find any and most historians will tell you that it never have happened that the German generals never came here\nAre people who believed the story said it was a a secret mission and therefore there would be no historic record\nThat was kind of the interesting one for me\nAnd what about other World War two infamous people do they still show up pawns\nWell there's some really interesting stories uh for me there's there's one that Churchill still haunts a subway in a\nIn a in London that once served as kind of a temporary\nBomb shelter and and and people have seen his spirit\nThere I found the story that Churchill actually witness to the ghost of Abraham Lincoln and World War two to be fascinating ah he said that he and I hate to lay this imagery on your listeners but\nA according to Churchill he had stepped out of the bathroom completely naked in what's now called the Lincoln Bedroom at the White House and he had traveled to the White House on several occasions to a visit with a\n... FDR Franklin Delano Roosevelt as well as other uh officials from the American side\nHe steps out of the the bathroom and there's Abraham\nLincoln leaning against the mantle and I think Churchill says something like when Lincoln turns to face him Churchill said something like ah I see you've caught me at a disadvantage Mr President and then a Lincoln fades away so that was kind of\nLincoln probably faded away quickly\nYes I I would've I would've got out there as fast as I could he's Lincoln has gone through enough he didn't need to witness\nNot I'm not a new Winston Churchill ...\nSo there's some other stories about Eisenhower he haunts ah what's called the bullet which is a a train that's on display at the national railroad museum I think that's in in Green Bay Wisconsin\nOr we talked a little bit about the ghosts of Gettysburg and apparently he andme Amy maybe behind some of the haunting Z in the farmhouse that they used to own their so yeah there's a a lot of um a famous ghost stories from uh some of the the\nBigger leaders of uh the most famous leaders of World War two and do these continue these haunting\nYeah they do as a matter of fact uh you know the the bullets uh I've leaves us the story that some of the stories that I found out about that uh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian\nSome doubt about that uh were from the Nineteen nineties the two thousands one story is that I'm a custodian who was a vacuuming the carpet in the bullet\n... uh was halfway finished and decided to take a break laughed lock the door of the the train and uh went to lunch or or have a snack and then when he came back\nThe someone had completed\nThe vacuuming and he could tell because the lines of the vacuum cleaner were super straight up and down and according to some of the people who knew Eisenhower he was very meticulous\nAnd that's how he insisted on having his the bullet cleaned so that story probably uh not too long ago\nAnd you know as we talked about the ghost plane flap they're happening probably even as we speak\nIt back in World War two there were actually reports of UFOs they called them poof fighters they were small little disc type objects flying all over the place that pilots reported seen did you come across anything like that\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list in the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone\nOr anywhere [noise]\nHi I'm Erin tailor the real estate guy I'd help Nevada residents buy and sell over five thousand homes since Nineteen Ninety four\nForty eight realty is proud to partner with the Nevada broadcasters association in recognizing the Nevada military support alliance Nevada servicemen and women are battle born and often stand in harm's way to fight for our freedom was dumb giving the ultimate sacrifice on there and Taylor the real estate guy and I am Nevada proud sponsored by ...\nAssociation in this day should from the justice to heart ... studios K intend ti am north Las Vegas ...

I thought wearing costumes on the civil war and their faces and the expressions were just they were extremely song is they were just awfully awfully worried from their expressions and\nThe smell of something that I had to get away from so I went back in and our guide caught me and said we're have you been and I said\nI just went in and nine I came out and they said we've been looking for you for the last half hour\nWhile while the we are we going to have enough time to watch the filming those costumes are excellent but please explain to me how they were able to get that damage that smell hideous smell and they all looked at each other and they see there isn't anyone out there\nAre there are a lot of smells associated with some of these teams man there is a central genre\nOf uh\nAre there are a lot of smells associated with some of these teams man there is a ...\nOf a sense with um with ah some of the haunting than a\nFor instance the er when ... I'm go story is really focused on the smell of a pipe that he allegedly used to smoke in this this haunted in so there there are stories like that there are stories about people getting the\nUh I think in the case of the heck I'm a airbase\nThere's the scent of a rotting corpses that overwhelms people\nUm the interesting thing for them when the caller reminded me that uh my history professor told me that one of the most sought after um\n[noise] ah articles uh after Gettysburg for the civilians was a kind of a I I think it was I guess you would describe it almost as many drops that they used to put on their nostrils because the the scent was so\nBad and then you know that story certainly reminded me of that\nA couple more months we will be in the seventies seventh anniversary of Pearl Harbor I guess there can't be many soldiers or seem in still left\nFrom the Nineteen forty one I mean that that was Seventy seven years ago right and if they were twenties maybe Ninety seven there might be a few but I don't think there are many are there\nNo I don't think so and it's um it's sad because again that that's why I think the important thing is to make sure that these\nThese stories are preserved and the memory goes on and if this book helps that at all or maybe inspires people to look into um [noise] the the battle of of Pearl Harbor in particular I think that it's done it's done its job\nBrian in Indianapolis is with us east of the Rockies good morning bright hey\nGeorge how are you ready to hope you are to me\nOh I'm at work again is all they are always working my gosh\nWell you know it's good for my four oh one K. my retirement\nPerfect and when you retire you still listen to the coast to coast right\nOh you you know it you know it he left and I got three things to say All right well I'm I'm a friend of air truck driving somewhere in Indiana\nAnd he's a good guy he is\nA good guy if you ever bring your show Kenyan apple is a George ... me we're working on that OK number two now a good story that might be something for the show in a later date it is a World War two a thing the USS Indianapolis the thinking of this that\nI think we we just did a show on that um about a month a couple of weeks ago\nSure I'm not winning you know I was a weekend show oh\nMan but there is a good book out I\nMean these were the ... the seeming to ruin the see the sharks were there it was horrible yeah\nYeah well our main went into the water just sent the ships sunken twelve minutes the well water man went in the water or know\nOut of twelve hundred men eight hundred and eighty eight eight hundred and eighty named went in the water three hundred and went down to ship five days later only three hundred and sixteen now because of new research done came out of the water or there's only can survivors\nAnd I'm the next July this coming July will be the last reunion here in Indianapolis 'cause it's so hard for them to get around like you said there are nine oh yeah absolutely guy and we always remember the greatest generation they sacrifice for us and they did a until but here I\nI was stationed in Germany are backing aide maybe one\nAnd they they sacrificed for us they did a untold but here I I was stationed in Germany are back in eight maybe one eighty three I kept it day trip which in\nSome ah friends of mine down to back out concentration camp ha ha and you\nKnow it was more of a political prisoner camp it wasn't like a extermination camp you know like I'm the mother ones were but we were you know we were able to take pictures and stuff you know in and when we got here when you use as soon as you walk in the gate the pressure on you which just ignore you\nCould feel it imagine feel it but we'll put picture you know and then back then you had thirty five millimeter camera so you had to get you had to get them developed\nTwo weeks later we were going through the pictures that a couple of friends of mine at taking\nDavid your guy that has overcome a severe issue or whether light the light bulb went on and I started to\nMore in the house David your guy that has overcome a severe issue or like a light the light bulb went on and I started\nTo research on the same reasons why I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better I can only tell you one thing the product war\nAnd not only works in one way it works for a whole bunch of different ways because it gives me energy gives me my ... my house just a better way to earn a war has built to everything back into my body just taken a while but you know a lot of his bag over there and I ...

Georgian or whether you along with Joshua worn are very expert paranormal investigator as we talk about several things including the cycle mantey him which was popularized by\nOr different Raymond Moody the originator of the term\nDeath experience and let us bring in Joshua pie worn right now hello there Mr Warren\nHey George I am so excited to be on the program tonight\nIf Halloween the event oh I Love it or we're going to dig into\nThis extremely creepy thing is I come at the mirror I also have an update for you about time warps in UFOs or later oh we're going to give away some free tickets to my biggest veteran Los Angeles this Saturday yeah there's a lot going on tonight so I'm pretty pumped to be with you drive\nThe way I'm bummed 'cause I've got to be in Denver taping some beyond belief shows on Saturday and Sunday I'm going to miss your event but at least the spirit of me will be with you OK\nWell you know what when people say that to me it means something so thank\nYou got that right or the cycle man the um it's a small enclosed area set up with a chair dim lighting the mirror is angle so you don't reflect anything but darkness it's intended to communicate with spirits the dead have you tried using one of these things\nOh yes Oh yes as a matter of fact a doctor Raymond Moody as a friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me and the number of other people in person\nA friend of mine and I even invited him to western North Carolina years ago to train me and the number of other people in person in the ... technique um and it is really however George began with me when I was a teenager\nBecause I started writing articles about ghosts and spooky things when I was quite quite young for the uh a local newspaper and I found again and again\nWhen I go into a haunted place\nSomeone would take me into a room and said this is the most haunted room and I would look around and see two mirrors facing each other\nA it got to the point where I Would go to a supposedly haunted house and say to the owner don't even tell me what the haunted room is let's see if I can figure it out and walk around and I'd find a room that had reflections like that\nAnd there's something about mirrors that magnifies ghostly and spiritual and often creepy phenomena um there are a number of possible explanations for this\nFor one thing when you have two mirrors facing each other and you look at the reflection it just looks like an infant a tunnel running like it goes on and on and on forever\nAbsolutely it's a reflection within a reflection with and now what is light light is electromagnetic energy and so it may be that we're creating some kind of an infinite tunnel of light which operates is some sort of a portal [noise]\nThat these beings that have some electromagnetic connection can sort of travel through to go in and out of our realm and that's pretty far out there and I know that but when you look at a mirror [noise]\nUm there's a similar phenomenon going on because we don't know what consciousness is and when you look at a near what you're doing is you're seeing yourself\nAnd so it's almost like you're creating an infinite tunnel of consciousness there and it may be that this helps to facilitate the passage of these spirits into our dimension\nOf course ancient people use described by staring into reflective things whether it be just a a a glass of water or a bowl of water or a creek highly polished stone\nBut there's something about this idea that when you take a reflective substance and you gaze on it and you go into a meditative state\nThen if your intention is to have a paranormal experience you have an experience Georgian and then I Want everybody to understand that I'm not talking about some kind of a little illusion like oh you see something spooky that shows up in the mirror or you just get some kind of a dream like trance like steak none of them\nWhen you do this properly and that's what Dr moody has studied how to do this properly when you perfect this you will actually have the experience of a full bodied tangible three dimensional\nSeemingly Corp portrayal figure that will appear right in front of you head to toe and this being can come up to you and not only speak to you but touch\nAnd so the idea here is that if you know how to use this technique and it's important to you and you go in there with a purpose you can create that experience for yourself and that will be your reality\nHow do you get rid of the spirit if you want to does it go back in what happens\nWell fortunately most of the time when people go into a truly well designed properly oriented psycho man the ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to ...\nThe well designed properly oriented psycho ... they're going in there with a mission they usually want to contact someone that they love\nWho has passed on and there's a preparation for that so if you were to go to somebody like Dr moody and say well I Want to contact my deceased mother than he would take you through a period of time that could be days\nWhere he just talks to you about memories of your mother and and says you know grab whatever artifacts that you may be able to find the reminds you of her and he pictures\nAnd he really talks you extensively through this whole process of remembering her\nAnd so then when you go in there your mind is charged with that intention and uh so that is what it dramatically increases the chances of your mother coming through now when this becomes\nVery scary it's when you have people who experiment or you know people talked about like I Know just about enough to get me in trouble ... thing you know\nYou have people who go in there and they just say I don't care I just want to see something\nAnd when you go in there with that attitude that's a ...\nYou you are well you know you get what you ask for right I just want to see something and if you want to if you go into these situations and it's very simple to create a cycle Mandy\nBut you're convinced they work\nOh they work they definitely weren't they weren't in fact\nUh over the years I've done many experiments where it was set up a camera to see if we can record the experience and sometimes we can't record what happens but it's very real for the person who's sitting there and the chair\nAnd so the basic thing you need is a big mirror on the wall of a dimly lit room with a chair in front of\nIt and I'm not that old saying mirror mirror on the wall I Wonder if that has anything to do with it\nAnd bloody Mary and blood you know all that kind of stuff yeah I think we ... the odd thing is you're not supposed to position the mirror directly in front of you so you can directly see your own face\nYou put a slightly above Iowa level usually have something like a candle or little nowadays Eli de laugh in the background\nAnd maybe some white noise I Love playing white noise it helps a lot with the and I've taken probably ah you know close to two hundred people through Sacramento him experience and I would say that a\nLot of people chores or is it is a lot of\nPeople yeah I I started doing this a long time ago even before I met Dr moody and\nA three quarters of them easily I almost want to say a hundred percent but I always am you know worried about or maybe I'm forgetting one or two incidents but almost a hundred percent of the people had some kind of a paranormal experience they couldn't explain and about half of them actually had the full\n[noise] I did in fact I broke this story on coast to coast am shooting them before I even did it [laughter] and I know that that that\nSounds a bit suspicious but no honestly what I was doing as I said I have the new piece of technology I'm going to take it to a certain place I don't think I said where of course that place turned out to be ...\nLas Vegas outside of Las Vegas Nevada and um\nI I I sort of gave everybody a heads up and then when I found something that surprised me um it went viral I mean I I made international news with this discovery it it was a Newsweek inside edition ABC NBC CBS Fox News\nMedia in Russia China basically I discovered some type of a space time anomaly between Las Vegas and area fifty one at this nondescript site on the side of the road out in the desert\nAnd it turns out that that is one of the most extreme UFO hot spots in\nThe state were incredible footage\nHas been shot of UFOs we're close encounters have occurred and so uh I have of course continued now going around and taking measurements trying to see if I can capture something else but in the meantime here's what I Would like to share with George and um\nI mentioned this to you when we were in Asheville by the way it was very cool that you played a a a group from Ashville North Carolina regroup\nPart [laughter] you know actual is my home town for for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my mystery museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very ...\nFor for listeners who may not know and uh you know that's where I have my history museum and we do the haunted Ashville go stores so very very fitting to play an Ashville group [noise] but anyway George in Ashville I mentioned this to you but it's gotten even more intriguing\nThere is a timeline that I Would like to know share with you in the audience that I think perhaps helps to put my discovery in context\nOkay um and I want everybody listening be the judge okay am I just being paranoid is all this just incidents or are we just seeing different facets of a larger project that is sort of a being slowly revealed or exposed however you want to do it\nAnd of course I never believe in coincidence\nWell you and I have that in common for sure I agree entirely to believe in that would mean you'd believe there could be in effect without a cause and that just doesn't make sense does it ... new\nSo All right let's start with December of twenty Seventeen this is something that's been talked about many times on coast to coast am of course the Pentagon finally announced that that that they were working on this thing a back engineering UFO debris in the state of Nevada\nAh the advanced aerospace threat identification program called a tip\nSo that was a big deal there should have been covered even more by the mainstream media\nBut it was not it was not no I mean it was broken by the New York times\nSo I mean there was plenty of ample opportunity for everybody to really get the scoop uh and this was a program that was a course headed up by Senator Harry Reid who was who was the senator from Nevada\nSenate majority leader and it involves a contract that was primarily given to Robert Bigelow aerospace who has his operation here in Nevada\nTo keep that in mind uh okay so now let's move up to June of twenty Eighteen of this year in early June NASA announced they found quote complex organic material on Mars and grow [noise]\nNow later in the month of June to be precise on June Eighteenth of two thousand Eighteen I discovered this time warp and which was the product of me being the first investigator to take this technology out into the field and use it\nThat night George as I was in my very remote motel room out in the middle of nowhere a winding down out in the middle of the desert I turn on the news and solve the very night that I discovered this time warp President Trump announced the creation of the space force\nSo here I Am next area fifty one and I get that news that was pretty intriguing that was in a memorable night [noise]\nUh and then we moved to July on July twenty fifth now NASA announced as there is an underground lake on Mars and also right around that same time Georgia nap whom we all know well and love who is of course a journalist here in the state of\nNevada and a good one\nYes he is the best uh he released this incredible mind boggling letter that Senator Harry Reid wrote to the department of defense in June of two thousand nine if any of your audience members have not read this letter I just want to point out a few key key parts of it\nThis is a letter where Senator Reid is saying we need more stringent security because of what we've discovered by ... this advanced aerospace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification\nSpace you know a project and and I've got it in front of me\nAnd he says much progress has been made with the identification of several highly sensitive unconventional aerospace related findings\nHe goes on to say given the likelihood that these technologies will be applied to future systems involving spaceflight weapons communications and propose and\nThe standard management and safeguarding for classified information or not sufficient he goes on to say even more and this is the one that really gets me\nAssociated exotic now that ... that ... that ... what do you think that means folks associated exotic technologies likely involve extremely sophisticated concepts within the world of quantum mechanics nuclear science electromagnetic theory graphics and thermodynamics\nGiven that all of these have the potential to be used with catastrophic effects by adversaries an\nUnusually high degree of operational security is required let me pause for a second here so he said in this letter which is a validated it's been verified independently verified it with my own sources here in Las Vegas [noise]\nHe's saying George we have discovered that exotic technology that's going to affect all these things but we have to make sure our adversaries don't\nGet don't get it that's right we we need to get it before they do that's what he's saying\nSo what he's saying is it didn't come from them new so if you discovered something that has that impact that didn't come from your adversaries and you call it exotic\nWhere could have possibly come from um I also want to just mention here briefly a you know there is a an appendix to Des where they go down a list of some of the topics\nThat have been a officially explored with this project and some of these topics there's thirty eight of them are one is a advanced space propulsion a invisibility or cloaking wormholes in space time gravity wave communication work drives brain machine interface\nA laser weapons quantum entanglement communication ultra capacitors and my favorite one is number thirty eight\nRedacted so it's like whoa you're putting all this incredible material out there with the topic and the scientists and the institution a scientist as with and yet still there is one that's redacted so anyway getting back to the timeline\nSo that also came out right around the same time and a ... with ... July twenty fifth All right so that said\nNow we move up to August\nAugust twenty eight team right around the time when you were doing your event in Asheville joined the mainstream media announced that the air force has been doing experiments dropping a new kind of weaponry\nWhich is very similar to a type of earth penetrating nuclear gravity bomb and they've been experimenting with these things and dropping with him and doing God Knows what else\nFrom a beat two at ... air force base which happened to be right beside the area where I got my anomaly and furthermore yes when they were doing their experiments\nJune of two thousand Eighteen when I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space for us\nSo that said\nWhen I got my anomaly and when the president announced the creation of the space for us so that said\nI Am of the impression here that there is some kind of amazing technology\nThat is being utilized to form some kind of weaponry that is being tested around here and I just so happened to stumble into a spot where they were testing their their their stuff out\nAnd it but you see the thing is it doesn't matter because\nThey're humans are not supposed to have technology that will manipulate space time but it looks like they might and I want everybody to know if you doubt what I'm telling you you can download this information for free if you go to Joshua ...

then there came a point when it just sort of drifted away that never happened\nFor gene auto he kept this\nThis uh ... uh till the end of his life and treated it in many cases they say if you talk to the locals better than he treated his wife I mean how little special furniture made for him and gave him a little special room\nSo are his room was an eventually moved to the attic at at the wife's insistence but you know they claim that when finally Eugene died\nA and his wife moved out of the house in the house sat there abandoned for quite a few years waiting for a buyer to come along and I actually did get to talk to some of the caretakers who ah worked in the house during that period of time who told me about just chilling experiences\nBut nonetheless people who were in the community

can create what similar to to ball lightening\nAnd so you have so much of that which is creepy\nAround western North Carolina but at the same time it almost seems to sometimes have a consciousness and

you with us Joshua ... the war in our final segment next hour we'll talk about on to the world war two amazing stories Matthew swing will join us so Josh my friend you are one of a kind how did you were originally get started in paranormal investigating what was that one catalysts that got you into it\n[noise] oddly enough George it was really an incident that happened before I was born really um 'cause I I come from a large family or my mother is the youngest of ten kids\nIt was born really um\n'cause I I come from a large family uh my mother is the youngest of ten kids and my dad is one of seven kids while and I both both sides in my family they've been in the mountains of western North Carolina since the uh late Seventeen hundreds early Eighteen hundreds\nA but there was this one incident that occurred on my mother's side of the family\nIn the great depression or my mother is a mother was named to Virginia Calloway that was her maiden name and when she was about Thirteen Years old she got a camera as a birthday present which was a pretty big deal back to her family was a little better off than most but\nThat didn't last long they they lost everything in the depression but she lives out in the countryside and one day her father a guy named Jack and her older brother who was in his twenties uh named Claude came home from a small game hunting trip and she photographed them\nA holding up their squirrels and rabbits and stuff and when the picture develop my great uncle clogged Calloway her older brother did not have a head\nAnd they they knew that was weird but they were not able to understand enough about photography to realize just how weird it was so fast forward one month later a claud was sitting on the porch of the house\nAnd he was reading a copy of his favorite publication western magazine old gunslinger tells\nAnd uh his father Jack was in the kitchen fixing fixing lunch and they were conversing through an open window and at some point or jak said something to Claude called didn't answer and when the lunch was ready jak went outside and\nI'm here has claws magazine lying on the porch but there's no claws and a long story short my great uncle clogged Calloway was never seen or heard from again\nJeez I'm David ladies involved in the ...\nWell yeah well you know it's actually it's not too far from where there is a national park these days you know the ... national park area and and and what's even weirder is that you know I mean they did everything they got the authorities involved they got you know they were searching the woods\nAnd um you know hearing this fellow at my great uncle who was waiting for his lunch you know in the middle of the story\nAnd reading a magazine and how could he have disappeared was the abducted was the rapture that way did he did he get caught up in a space time slip I mean we don't know but but you see it was compounded by the fact that this creepy photograph was taken\nOne month before and when I became an adult I went back to that area and did everything I could to try to find out what had happened and I mean I've verify the whole story with\nElderly people and ah historians and but still there's there's no explanation for this and and you see this was a big tragedy in my family ah they never got over it they never had closure\nAnd I got to grow up sort of seeing the the sensitive wound that just created and it made me realize that some of these mysterious phenomena or they're not just legends or superstition or or old folk tales I mean the the paranormal if you want to call it that\nThere's something very real that we have to take seriously and so that inspired me to go out and sort of try to define fact ah versus fiction and then finally by the time I got into my early twenties was when I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own to ours\nAnd finally by the time I got into my early twenties was when I really started seeing some bizarre stuff for myself with my own to ours\nGood for you let's go to the final goals here let's go to Mary in Los Angeles to get things started Hi merry go ahead\nI Microsoft is November ... will go go ahead and that was long it will it will\nAlso said yes and how does that relate to how all souls and Halloween\n[noise] yeah well thank you for your call Mary as a matter of fact um my birthdays October twenty fifth\nMy mother's birthday is November the third the day after yours and my sister's birthday is November the fifth and I can't tell you how many people I Know who have birthdays around Halloween including Dr Moulder who builds wishing machines his birthday is on Halloween\nAnd I'll just say a ... if you go back nine months it takes you kind of close to Valentine's Day so maybe there's an explanation for why I Know so many people who have birthdays around or you know October [noise]\nBut um as far as your particular question is concerned so the the the basic tradition of Sao on\nWhich of course we now call Halloween is built around October thirty first and this is the product of the Catholic Church\nComing into the pagan areas of Europe and trying to dominate them and switch them away from their pagan beliefs into Christianity\nWith their own date well November ...\nWell they they realize that you know they weren't ... doing a good job at switching them over to Christianity so instead the Catholic Church tried to sort of work with a pagan and say instead of considering October thirty first\nUm some kind of a pagan holiday you know why don't why don't we kind of a you know sanctify this whole time period\nAnd say that well this is the evening before the spirits of the saints comeback which would be November the first and so we will say November the first is the Halloween day\nAnd the evening before that is the Halloween evening or Halloween and so then uh they sort of combined the pagan beliefs of Halloween with all saints day on November first\nAnd then of course November second they said well why don't we just not only celebrate saints\nBut just celebrate all the soles of people who have died and so you end up with all souls day uh but this is one of those are interesting examples it goes back to you know Christmas we're going to be hearing more stories about this and uh probably is Christmas approaches where", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast
