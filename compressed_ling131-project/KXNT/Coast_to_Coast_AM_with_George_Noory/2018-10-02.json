astrological wisdom\nWas late breaking reporting in an online newspaper format he's done thousands of astrological consultations\nAnd mark welcome back to the program\nOh thank you George glad to be here\nLooking for is that your only website or do you have others\nDo we just started a great their enterprises\nThat that's what I Want her to a\nSeven stars of the great there it's very exciting state of the yard very beautiful\nWhich one do you prefer that we use\nA grape or enterprises my daughter has just been the Web master Web designer look very very beautiful and all kinds of new things on their\nSuper what are you going up to lately well that that's what we've had a full time right well pretty\nMuch um and getting into the world of pod cast beginning thing was with a book and other kinds of things that have been wanting to move into and suddenly now with the state of the art website we're really getting going with that\nYou were with me years ago and when you were first on with me are executive producer Lisa line who thinks the world of you says I'm going to give you a special guest he's a mundane astrologer\nRight and I went what what\nWhat are you giving me somebody who's mundane for\nIt if it's actually uh I I guess\nIn the field of astrology that that's the name that has been around for hundreds of years for people who study pretty much\nIt's it's really earth astrology global astrology it's the astrology of nations of world leaders thing with like eclipse is new moon is full of major planetary alignment in other words it's kinda the opposite he's doing personal horoscope readings although I I've been doing that\nJust as long um for the word again now people think of mundane kind of just ordinary and that's really not what it is\nAre the results the same mundane astrology and personal horoscope type or readings\n[noise] no I mean well you're dealing with the same planet\nFine line there there's a fine line isn't there\nWell again kind of the make or caused them rather than microcosm and so people who are in my field it's just kind of they're they're wanting to take the broad objective universal perspective on things that they prefer to look at the big picture of national events current event the way the world\nKind of where I was I read the ... the world book um you know the almanac the world ... book affects every year would come out back in the fifties and sixties is still going after a hundred and fifty years actually mostly for sports like baseball growing up in New York with all the sports baseball football and so on\nSo I got into that and was really into ... social studies and current events and then of course a President Kennedy came into office\nWith the with the Peace Corps the alliance for progress I was I was a young teenager and then we know what happened you know in the sixties there and I just wanted to keep focusing more on the world the nation in the world probably because of that particular event\nMarch tell us exactly what is strongly gee is\nWell what we're as I said before as above so below this goes back to ancient Egypt the idea of a ... of being called ... or the the thrice great ... which is the actual\nEgypt and Greek name for for the planet mercury and supposedly that was a deity somebody came down and taught all kinds of numbers and mathematics and we really get a lot of our astrology we know\nI'm of the modern astrology we say modern goes back about two thousand years to the time of someone named Ptolemy who is also connected to Egypt but then we go back to Rome we go back to Greece but really Egypt is where there's so much and I also studied all kinds of things we regarding Atlantis\nOr when I first got in the whole field I got into reincarnation meditation metaphysics lived at the ... community after spending a number of years I'm working next to the United nations have what's called the Alice Bailey center or loses publishing and I know you've had some people on you know connected to those areas\nLet's talk about retrograde plan what does that mean\nWell again if we were just if we're all living on the sun or from the solar perspective he Leo\nNothing the pilots just keep going the ordinary cycles mercury has an eighty eight day forward moving a orbit around the sun um we have three hundred and sixty five days each planet has its normal motion but because we're Ninety three million miles away\nAnd the astrology we use is what we were called geo centric every so often all the planets now this is not the center moon George but all the planets\nWill tend to appear\nTo go in reverse from our vantage point oh\nIt's kind of like a this is the perfect metaphor you're at a train station\nAnd you're in a train and your train is beginning to pull out okay now another train right next to yours\nIs going to go in the same direction they start pulling out after you end up kind of looks like an optical illusion for a moment like you know they're kind of ... in your direction but they're like going the other way and it's confusing well that is kind of the idea of retrograde motion\nSo what most people have tuned into all over the decades\nIs mercury going in reverse because that planet does it three times from the earth perspective for about three weeks at a time and what's amazing now into that as an Eighteen if you if I went to Google or as far as one of these places and you put in mercury retrograde\nYear and then you click on images it's still a little George with all kinds of things like stop signs and road signs saying mercury Richard ... don't go here don't go there because people are actually too afraid that the cycles are negative when the planet's going reverse\nIf you have five different astrologers ... would you had five different kinds readings at any given time\nUm well let me answer it one way if people who really studied them to feel like I have with four and a half decades very intensively it\nSay a five of those people me and for others and you gave them the same chart of somebody or the same event\nAnd you ask them you know specific questions I think you've pretty much get the same kind of understanding and interpretation depending on what the questions are as long as the what I Try and do you know we we've often talked about politics and other things over the years because I've been on during the election times and often you know people want\nTo hear a prediction you're gonna go however\nAstrology really works best in terms of ... or as you said and he's studied it or not just psychology and UFOs and ... dollars and everything else but he actually studied astrology hundreds of people got married and he's the one that I use is called before whatever is born at a moment of time\nHas the qualities of that moment of time it's because time should not be thought of as like I'll meet you at ten o'clock in the morning at such and such place so that people think of time it's kind of a convenient system it's really a power and so when a person is born and they have a particular astrology charts\nAnd at their first moments that they take their first breath the sun the moon the planets they're put around in a great circle and they're in different signs of the early ... and the ... puts it altogether and reads it as a kind of I'm\nAlmost like a spiritual genetic code to interpret what is the greater purpose or higher destiny of that particular individual but\n... ... several hundred thousand people around the world are born on any given day and so lots of people have more or less the same kind of\n... solar energy lunar energy and planetary energy it's just indifferent formations some setting summarizing some above some low so at any rate the answer is basically I think that most ... kinda who've been around the horn a long time will come up with a similar result\nArgue psychic too or just the Charlotte\nI'm Glad you asked that question I okay if I say out to the public my my son is in Pisces which tends to be at least as I understand that sign rather reticent to to be\nA for instance do welcome to planet earth for Twenty years I'm not somebody who likes marketing and advertising and commercial stuff I'm much more focused that's why the Monday in astrology virtual things and so I'm fundamentally um I ... it's interesting you asked me that because I have been very psychic\nAnd intuitive but I don't broadcast it but particularly in things like sports because I that's what I Love the most\nAnd scientifically in in sports you're astrological psychic like okay stay with us mark run a break we're going to come back and talk about world events how they affect all of us and the next hour we'll take your phone calls with the astrologer in his website great beer enterprises dot com Martin Lorna\nUm and then October Nineteen Nineteen eighty seven to one day crash I'm not anticipating anything like that at least I'm\nNot at the moment I'm the one thing that is interesting though um is that the the people call this planet\nBurden is Iran of your your rain it's depending on their pronunciation but that planet the first of the outer planets um which is so powerful when America was born because when a Seventeen eighty one\nWhen the American revolution was one is is the same year that Iran is was cited by sir William Herschel and ironically in bath England\nUm but at any rate that planet has just gone into Taurus okay and tourists as the main sign of money and ... New York stock exchange which is a chart that is used by a lot of astrologers goes back to ... Seventeen of Seventeen Ninety two and so\nNot yet but in the o five years\nOr Iran and spends about seven years and a sign that planet which is a planet of\nExtreme change revolution the unconventional soda things coming out of left field shock some surprises Iran us will cross over the sun the solar life force of the New York stock exchange when when that happens it'll probably happen three times in the course of the year\nBut it is a little bit down the road although\nIf that happens with some of the other things I see on the horizon for America which is we're facing Pluto coming back uh which takes two hundred and forty seven years and if you had two hundred and forty seven years to Seventeen Seventy six to get two thousand twenty two two thousand twenty three\nAnd that's one of the big things that mundane astrologers\nOf my field people look at these kinds of things like\nA nation's chart of nations are born like people if you can locate the birth time of country cities have charts states of the union have charts but America is definitely going to have something very big coming coming up in a number of years including I'll probably market changes but I don't see it\nNow what about Chris zones\nNow crypto does this this brings up something I find really fascinating and and this is one of the bigger things in the field of astrology it's part of mundane astrology it's that over about an eight hundred year cycle okay it's actually seven hundred and Ninety four years the ... the planets Jupiter and Saturn which the largest planets they've been actually\nBy people going back a couple of thousand years we can go back to the middle east and they were charting believe it or not because they didn't have\nA all of our modern conveniences they were sky watchers so the the ancient people were not just astrologers they were ... they just didn't have the scientific kind of things that we have now we can locate everything exactly to a degree of ...\nBut basically Jupiter and Saturn or the big movers and shakers and they go through each of the elements fire earth air and water so to make a what's happening is since Eighteen forty one every Twenty years\nJupiter and Saturn have been in earth science okay and that has been the rise of the main banking world the financial world as we know it\nBut what's gonna happen is on December Twenty one of two thousand twenty which is only two years in a couple of months from now\nThose two planets Jupiter and Saturn merged together at the beginning of Aquarius\nAnd then for the next like a hundred and eighty years all the Jupiter Saturn are going to be an air sides and the point here is that crypto currency is are more connected to the air element of things that are more\nA theory that are more online that are more part of the communication world and not part of the physical material dimension that we've been dealing with since the Eighteen forties of the banking world the corporate world and all that so that we were ready to have a big change but we're not yet there\nHave you been following the story of the Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh\nOr should I say unfortunately F yeah gives you can say that a very stormy and\nUm I we do have a couple of things on the website that people can look at I've created something new and my daughter has created it really beautifully it's called astro flash it allows me to do some shorter things so I don't have to write very very long articles\nBecause so many people now they want to kind of a short hit so I've got a couple of things on great parent prizes in art or a earth Aquarius news zones so now earth Aquarius news which is still a website we have a smaller earth Aquarius news segment and grapes enterprises and people can read some of my takes about what's been happening\nWith Brett Kavanaugh and and Dr ah Christine Blasey Ford\nInteresting take on all of this well you can you predict if I mean today one of his color Joe ... says I Can't call um a friend who said that he was a drunk\nWill you know it's interesting with President Trump because we know he is he is he's not a drinker because of his brother died of alcoholism\nYou know and regardless of where people are on the political spectrum\nOr the president certainly speaks his mind sometimes to some people too much but the thing is is that you sort of wonder what is going on here with whether or not um he could withdraw I mean you know it it looks like he's going to stick with it from what from what he said you know last Thursday\nI don't think it's the thing is going to be hard to prove anything\nThrough um you know that such and such an event actually happen however the whole ambiguity of everything is really big and what I did is I looked at the charts for the moment of Thursday when the session began you see that's part of mundane astrology\nAlways limits in charge of a person although you can do that and I have looked at their charts individually but very often if it's a national thing or an international thing with the mundane astrologer does as we look for the moment that something began and it's like a charge just like a baby was born and we look at that chart and that chart\nIs very descriptive of that whole time all last Thursday\nJenna put you on the spot and ask you if you think he's going to get confirmed ... speaking\nWell okay here's the interesting thing you brought up the retrograde this Friday the planet Venus in the science Scorpio which is often connected to not just psychic things but sexual ...\nYou know this is going to make one of those retrograde at the end of the week and Mitch McConnell just said today hey we're going to vote on this thing this week it keeps trying to push it\nI don't think it'll happen but well\nYeah well the thing is is that ... there's too much unknown but if I open hazard a guess you know I Would just say there's certainly pushing forward it'd be a major embarrassment but here's the deal if he doesn't get confirmed there's going to be just as conservative with somebody else who's going to be nominated\nIn in his in his place so it's not as if suddenly it'd be a liberal or Merrick Garland they're not getting in there\nIs there anybody out there that a squeaky clean well I think\nThat would be because they've been saying that uh a\nLot but my question was alert you think you'll get confirmed and I'm like a logical you speaking\nWell after logically we know his chart I Would I Would say probably but I I just think it's going to be based on pushing from the Republicans full force you know Mitch McConnell trying to take control\nThem used to hazard a guess on that side of the equation\nYou still didn't answer me you know I think it will get confirmed\nDo you do okay All right not not that\nI that might be one I I I'll be wrong on but I'll I'll and I'll say now\nYou at least you took a stand\nRight because when the whole thing happened with Trump and Hillary um where so many of the predictors and you know these forecasters were were all looking at everything\nUm I was on and I looked at the numbers and I thought that Hillary would probably win that she did have more you know a popular vote but she lost those key states by small amounts Michigan Wisconsin a Pennsylvania sixty seven thousand votes out of a hundred and twenty million\nAnd that turned the election to the electoral college than Trump won\nSo amazing work now next stop let's talk about Kim Jong un on and his upcoming planned meeting with President Trump the second meeting right what do you what do you think what do you think is happening here\nUm well I'll tell you one thing and I think this little this will be an interesting thing for you to when you talk to your other or people who come on often about Iran and the world situation\nI think it's a done deal that they are going to have nuclear weapons and they're never going to get rid of him\nBut what's gonna happen is that because of the way Trump is doing this thing\nUm in other words it'll be like you develop this kind of Brotherhood [laughter] whether it's a false whether or not a kind of you do these kinds of things that no other president would have ever done\nAnd you try and just sort of like make things nights and then eventually you know right now they just said the other day uh the secretary of state said we would like them to denuclearize by the end of of the president's administration I don't know if you're caught that did you see that\nNew Hampshire did it was like we're wait we want them to do it tomorrow last week why they're dragging their feet and then during\nSo I don't know if it was late friday or something oh you know as long as they do it within the next two years were fine what you know and so I just I've seen this all the way through the danger I think I'm In all of this\nThis personal diplomacy we don't know if Kim Jong un is going to be the leader tomorrow the next day in this country at least we have a succession of how\nAre you also don't know what he's doing his trek\nSo you got the tricky thing we the other thing is\nUh in astrology and this is very important Donald Trump's sharp President Trump Detroit is known we've known as exact birth time for decades and it's not a mystery Hillary Clinton's birth time could have been twelve hours off nobody has figured it out it's not talked about birth certificate it's not as if we've ever seen it\nSo she was kind of an unknown quality in terms of her chart okay we didn't know whether she was morning or evening we don't know the year of Kim Jong on their report\nNevada is recovering from the housing crisis many of your neighbors maybe even you\nDream of owning a home without

you have a specific question\nI don't really you know not really an overall okay well\nWe're about to give you the overview bear with me computer I this is to take the um George hours what I'm doing now in in minutes or an\nAgent and you'd better be minutes on this show right could you imagine the taking hours\nOkay uh you have a it's interesting just like the previous caller another moon in areas okay we're which means like from the past ... recent lifetime\nYou've developed leadership skills that you need to bring through there's kind of instinctual like being in charge being assertive without being aggressive so there was a kind of forceful part but your son sign Aquarius\nAquariums need to learn through groups through friendships through team kind of activities or global kind of things are where you're ... you ... that are sort of close to your philosophy of life and\nWhat's in your heart and you're also born with Pisces rising which adds if it's positive a compassionate empathic kind of energy and also a psych equality interestingly you like the previous caller have an enormous amount of Capricorn the previous caller had sun a Capricorn\nYou have one two three you have five less devising ... record more than even when you have an Aquarius a Capricorn\nUm is worth Saturn is moving and so you also if you want to do this you're you're moving into a strong career cycle\nAnd I mentioned earlier you asked me George something really fortuitous good happening and I said Jupiter going into its own kind of subject terrorists well here's somebody Donna\nYou're born with Jupiter and Saturn ... so it's going to be home coming few over the next year a lot of Jupiter and Saturn so do something in the world or something you know we're making\n'em expressing yourself in society and kind of a mover in shaker ... even in your community or neighborhood or your state you know to do something that you feel a significant and worthwhile\nAlright Don good luck to you hope everything works out so amazing mark how you're able to pinpoint individuals with a strong as\nWell because it's kind of like if if I were a doctor okay and what I'm\nDoing if you just if you said okay this person needs advice about their chest area and you put an x-ray in front of me I just start talking you know the doctor thing whatever it is\nAnd it's right then you'd say okay\nUh looked serious enough that you know we're going to have to put you on antibiotics and then go back and forth a little bit well for how long you know and then come back to me\nIt could be a pneumonia it might be bronchitis will will have to take you know have have you do some you know see what happens so it's kind of like a Rorschach test the chart is is so magical but it's like again if this were a beginner and that they'd be looking around and saying what do I do you know I see that there's the symbol for Aquarius there's Pisces there's some Capricorn but it would\nBut when you have done it for forty six years you know if they're like on the website I have what's called the cosmic calendar which used to be and walk on the planet earth and now it's independent and that's where people can\nSee what's in the sky every day and they can they can subscribe you know for a year or two and we even have a new thing where they can try it for one week for less ... less than a dollar or among through less than ten dollars if it's kind of part of the new great there\nWell that's fantastic that's you've been doing this for so long and you know I I think it's important for people to chart themselves right into the sea the direction they're going for advice\nMy whole goal has always been George again this part of my Pisces what I when I Do a consultation for somebody I hate to say that I mean I'd love to have them come back hey I'd like to do a deeper thing and you know I can do charts\nOf compatibility with a loved one or a parent and a child but my goal is to get them so excited that ... years later they would come back and say you know you did my reading and studying and I'm doing it on my own if I can do that that is the greatest thing that I could do\nCouples ever come to you mark to say are we compatible with well\nI Will say this first of all I don't do this anymore\nBut I used to do a lot of marriage charting really\nYeah it ... but the thing is it's a very\nFine tuned I'm there we have a ... we have reports that we sell coal friends and lovers and there's something called ...\nSo I I Would tell people to go to our strategy you poor thing and they can put in their birth data and get that relatively quickly for me to do things is ... you know it's more expensive you have to do to charge you got to get background information both people\nBut basically astrologers have been doing this for a long time and it's and it's like you look at Venus and Mars for lots of love and or the sun and moons matching up and all the different planets but it's quite complex but you can do it\nAre you like a human too real card\nWell I've created to to row decks one with my ex wife each uh uh we did enter trial courts which have sold well over a hundred thousand copies for the last like almost Thirty years so many different languages and she has done an enormous amount of promotion of that and then I did baseball Toronto and I just ran into the gal Laura Philips\nThe other day I hadn't seen her a while and that has not sold all that well because the publishers sort of will doing calendars but they had never done a terrific project so I've done to row longer than I've done a strategy\nI'm going to give you our next the special callers birth date first of all November\nNineteen Nineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight we're going to Bradley in Illinois Bradley\nDo you know where you were born\nThough Illinois in\nDelano well and we have all the time any idea\nI'm I'm not sure that exact time\nOkay do you have a question from mark who just want him to get going here\nYeah I like the old spiritual aspect to it you know like a recurrent nation also another thing like that which tower under you know make a difference you know are you are a thing as well\nI don't study Chinese now I just want to make it you know I Am aware of the five different elements and those kinds of things and the you know the twelve ... the birthday is that kind of but um what I Need to know is was it Nineteen eighty eight\nNineteen eighty eight November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight okay hold on one\nSecond okay while you're doing that we've got a couple of minutes before the break mark and we'll take some more calls when we come back later on tonight by the way we are going to be talking about flying saucers from beyond the earth would Gordon Moore go ahead mark\nSo November Nineteen Nineteen eighty eight I'm just putting in like close to sunrise this person is a sun science ...\nAnd I believe is the third time in a row we looked like we have another mood in areas that that is really\nTalked about not so unusual that yeah I mean there are twelve five three callers all within areas man that's my that's my audience [laughter]\nSo again we have somebody and this is interesting traditionally Mars which I mentioned earlier is going to hit its own zero point of areas on December thirty one and New Years which is what I said you know it's it's traditionally a planet of war but it can also be a planet of energy a planet of passion\nFor a sports exercise and this person who just called um has the moon in areas conducting Mars and he's the son signed Scorpio and traditionally Scorpio is also ruled by Mars was considered to the ancient Mars is night fine\nBecause it ruled that water side to this person has a lot of Mars a lot of intensity\nUm a lot of enduring\nEnergy that comes through the Scorpio world and currently Jupiter is making a ... a a crossing just finished three times on this individual's Marjorie so he\nThe fact that he made it through on this is probably part of Jupiter offering a kind of blessing just that he's on here and again I Would say to him he also has Capricorn strong\nTo do some kind of a study in metaphysics philosophy um people who have his side Scorpio need to really get into these things\nI'm sort of hit a hot and heavy way and stay with it\nYou pick lottery numbers Mark I'm I I'm I often enter you know the different lotteries Powerball and so on a five years ago I had four out of the five number is a horrible didn't show up wow closest I've come that would've been a\nAlmost two

com work does the media ride shooting star affect anybody's astrological chart\n[laughter] um I don't know that that would actually do something although my favorite magazine is astronomy and yeah you got to Wisconsin I don't know if you get it it's beautiful and the credible gotten it for a long time and they just had and the previous issue with there's a a free program I don't\nRemember exactly where it is I have an order to yet\nWhich I think is really unique with that people can see\n'em they can plot like\nAround America around the world when the moon would a cult a planet or star and even an asteroid to sort of comes close to what you're asking about and that's actually a software program so in the software world these are amazing things but meteor you know we have the you know the different kind of media storms that happen every so often like this one\nIn August you know the Perseids and different ones\nUm there there may be some effect with some people I think more psychic Lee the people who like are prone to you know respond to earth changes you know some people tune in to earthquakes and\nAnimals and you you know things like that so I'm anything's possible that it wouldn't really change the charts so much\nAll right let's go back to the final coal series they line up for you or your next birthday is October Twenty one Nineteen fifty coming up pretty soon a birthday October Twenty one Nineteen fifty we'd go west to Albert in Tucson, Arizona hey Tucson how are you Albert\nAn evening mark happy I'm coming birthday to you my friend oh well thank you very another year oh there you\nKnow they keep clicking by do you have a question for mark I just want him to do reading for you\nOr he can do or reading my question which I've been kind of in a financial limbo for the last year so I was wondering if that was going to change and the other question is about you know it's love and money the money go ahead Mr learner\nOkay ah by the way I did solve the aries three people in a row because there's something called the part a fortune in Arabic astrology which was developed a thousand years ago they were all mathematically oriented that's where we get algebra and there was what's called parts like the part of the birth part of marriage and so on something called the part of fortune\nAnd throughout the entire a segment there the part of fortune\nFor Los Angeles and out on the west coast was in the areas the sign that the moon was showing up in the part of fortunes very connected to the moon and the moon was also is the moon as an aside cancer and is rising in the first house of self expression which isn't the kind of archetype all areas area so there was a reason that happened while this fellow now has a ...\nAnd ... is from from the past from another life or other existence is in the past\nThis person has developed in this could be why the financial thing\nI'm more of sort of a need for compassion may be working in religion and philosophy behind the scenes and it's not ... not very much of a mover and shake her in the world\nSo as an individual people who have Pisces moon come in and they're more impact and paths okay for good or for ill okay and some people with strong Pisces moon can get sort of pulled into they can become vulnerable you know to other people and lose their way but\nThe sun sign of this individual is the sign of a partnership Libra and he also has Neptune mercury and Venus\nThere in that science so as far as relationship is concerned the keynote esoteric leaf reliever is I Choose the way that leads ... between the two great lines of force and my mentor\nA day and Roger talked about Libra as the great pyramid following the mystery of the things which is really Leo in Virgo the body of lie on the head of a it'd be a woman\nAnd so the whole Egyptian mystery kind of tradition it goes back to the summertime of cancer Leo Virgo and leave right so so basically spiritually\nThis person should study everything about the great pyramid and that would be very good because there's a lot of law about mysteries even Jesus going and being a potentially initiate you know two thousand years ago during those last years from you know from age twelve or Thirteen to thirty three\nGoing all around the world to India possibly to Egypt going to a lasting very and in England I mean these are kind of war but may very well have happened so study the great pyramid study Egypt\nA and get into things like reincarnation metaphysics that might help\nAlright anything else they're Albert\n... no just uh how is it my upcoming year looking well\nJupiter you have for planets celestial bodies inside the terrorists are Jupiter is kind of tick off\nWhat are called conjunctions to palace which has to do with solving problems to get into a kind of study about how to solve your problems and developing strategic thinking and you'll also have Jupiter contact your Mars what's called higher on and series\nSo those are all unusual planets but their ... their gifts from the heavens so Jupiter the king of the gods which has a lot to do with you know success power of positive thinking faith Providence benevolence is really ...\nIt gives here so hopefully you can use them\nNext up we're going to the Rockies November twenty of Nineteen fifty five let's go to Jane in Florida and she was born a two forty in the morning a mark boy you're going fast November twenty of Nineteen fifty five what time\nTo forty in the morning ... am to forty AM let's go to Jane in Florida she was on her mind Hi Jane\nMy knees how's everything\nOh I'm going out hey\nHey any question for mark or just reading\n... um or how about general meeting\nAll right mark general reading again November twenty of Nineteen fifty five to forty eight now okay\nWell uh\nHer mom away [laughter]\nWell now we've got the beginning of Aquarius ... uh where you have some strong energy is George and I do as well ... at the beginning of aquarium yeah\nAnd this woman who is called a has the moon with higher on\nWhich was discovered Nineteen Seventy seven entire on is kind of a ... so this brings up the idea of getting involved with a group or some kind of group process would be really good for the soul spiritual standpoint where you're kind of building\nRainbow bridges between your spiritual life and higher destiny and your personality world but definitely\nTeam or group were community were global kind of connections you've done this before in the past and it's still important to keep doing it just like the other a color you you're going to get the fortunate oh Jupiter energy you have\nAn asteroid called Juno the planet Venus which represents represents love relationship\nOr creative artistry in what's called the north no to the moon which is the moon's orbit they're all inside the terrorists are Jupiter is going to help you with all the ... energy that the the big issue probably in your life or being a sun science Scorpio and you have sun close to Saturn\nIs you know um you need to be the warrior the turkey note for Scorpio is warrior I Am in from the battle I emerged triumphant in every suns science Scorpio comes into life\nHaving to be daring and courageous but also off and having a lot of um challenges just kind of like the need to die to the old and then be reborn but we're Jupiter is moving\nUm is very helpful for you over the next a next year next Thirteen months it starts a November eighth and continues into the rest of the fall into the new year so there are are suspicious vibes coming up\nOkay any questions Jane\nUm how about a year going into my ... house of um yeah I see that yeah oh is that going to get any thinking\nWell if you don't okay using to forty in the morning what's happening is that that planet is making what we call a square or right angle\nTo where the moon is and it's also you're at an age where you're honest is making a square or right angle to its own position\nSo what you want to avoid as nervousness and anxiety because in medical astrology Iraq that planet Iran has a lot to do with the nervous system\nSo when people are able to sort of meditate or study particularly a cult or metaphysical subjects or things like astrology encountered subjects than you're using your energy is on a higher level your intuition is developing the good things are happening but if you sort of\nTeenager head to discover the fourth part of our to find a neighborhood park or green space near ... us courts survey\nMost of my family they never

I was I was there during the middle of that and how\nThey died so you were right there on\nOn was born in Detroit remembered the story in a yeah I remember Hi Nick come into the mid west and talking about swamp gas station in haunted him after he said that didn't show or dead but\nBut he began to change his his his mind take more ... particularly after a shock poll a I spent a full day with Heineken job for a lay at the Northwestern University in Nineteen Nineteen sixty nine and and by then a high and they had already\nAnd at that and said the UFO question needed a serious scientific investigation and and and he was no longer going to pull it as something or you know\n... wants to change them Gordon just because something dramatic happened to more he went from being the project Blue Book consultant\nWhich was basically deny deny deny ... all of a sudden a staunch believer in UFOs even having his own organization out of Chicago uh-huh\nI mean what what was that trigger points for him that John ... I always heard it was the ... the police officer on ... a great\nCase they really did April twenty fourth Nineteen sixty four and I kept at a thorough investigation elect case where this police officer saw\nA um a landed craft with I think it was three occupants outside it\nA little ma'am Utah was flipped over car when he was driving in Italy got there and went oh my God\nThat's ... that's ... that's correct and and uh uh and then the thing\n... over a dynamite Shaq just missing it by inches and and uh and throw away and and and ah hind it was quite impressed by that by that case I think that may have been the one case that\nThat started them thinking that um maybe he should reverse stats took a couple more years to do it but I think maybe a ... something to do with it too because a a shock and and I'm Alan Hi Nick or a\nMatter of fact a a high neck was a ...\nJacques or mentors yeah that came over a close friend\nAnd a course his his book was published I think it was last year was twenty seven to ... about the fact that the hunting biography and somebody actually in England now a lady is working on a biography of ...\nThat would be super I Know ... you should be quote in part because you were there\nMight make the oil the I'm I'm In touch with her so cool I think I Will\nDo you think the media today is different from the media back in the sixties because it's my feeling Gordon that the media in the sixties really seem to be interested in UFO cases in took took it seriously\nI mean Mike Wallace when he was on ABC in Nineteen fifty eight\nHe was interested he interviewed key\nBut they're all they're always seem to be censorship going on there but\nI Know well I I can tell you back and uh and the sixty seven of doing the flap sixty six sixty seven the media\nI mean I was up some time 'til two o'clock in the morning and I kept a course in Washington DC fielding calls from is far away as Australia while and uh Germany\nAnd I was on a\n... a a negative speak radio program and journey it in Germany at two o'clock in the morning and the mail man would bring in twice a day huge sex all the letters\nSo the ... and ... and there were these huge flaps you solve them in almost every newspaper that doesn't happen much anymore\nWhere would you have been in Nineteen Seventy one\nIn Nineteen Seventy one I was um and because the Maryland and that's all you're talking about McDonnell now right\nWe were you were you interested in UFOs\nThen of course yeah as a matter of fact a a Jim McDonnell was out of her home he's he spent of course\nYou know James McDonald was the number one I'm\nAdvocate matter of fact he tried so hard to get time to change his mind that he had just slammed his fist down on the hunt next desk and\nAnd and said that high

out there what is you got to tell you about you use and whether this plan it's not\nMy gut tells me after doing all the research writing this book reading mysteries of the skies measures of the sky is was the first book\nEver written in Nineteen sixty eight that went back I'm beyond I went back before the cannot Arnold case ha ha\nThere and matter of fact I went into the national archives in Washington DC\nAnd town ships are wailing shipped captains log\nThat actually described in his own handwriting a disk that came out of this guy went down into the water came back up again\nAnd then circled the ship and then that off at a tremendous through it and and this was like in Eighteen forty eight or something like that and there was another case that I found also in the national archives in the seventeenth century\nWhere um I uh some men were rafting a a a\nOh we're trying to paddle a raft down in the muddy river ah in in Massachusetts when they saw this huge addicts this that came out of the sky I started drawing the raft up\nRiver against it and then it ... it lifted up out of the air for a little bit plopped it back down into the water and took off disappear you how can you handle a lot of those things and and a lot of that was um in my book mysteries of the skies UFOs in perspective\nYou know people like John back in the\nNo I didn't know John Mack and all that it is I

Gordon Moore with us as we talk about his latest work flying saucers from beyond the earth is website is his name and it's linked up the coast to coast team dot com some of these cases in your book Gordon just bring back just amazing memories\nAh I I just used to remember how excited I was every time I'd read a brand new UFO story and just looking at them and flying saucers from beyond your recollect all these all these stories all over again are amazing\nYeah yeah well I I kept some good files which I\nI took her three through the years and I've been I've been wanting for at least ... years to do this book and finally got around to it and uh hopefully it's my uh it may be on the phone but I think I may maybe\nEven about this subject and\nWhy do you think the government really has not just lose what school you know why don't they tell us\nWhy I think they're coming close with this latest program that with the Pentagon I think it's the closest I've ever come\nBut um I have a theory and it it it it may sound kind of a court case but uh I think that we ever known all along\nWhere it is a a saucers come from and that we've been actually exchanging perhaps technologies let's hear\nIt it sounds like a far out thing is that something kill would approve of it as hey day\nA matter of fact ... reluctant without any of the occupation or reports until I wrote the votes strange effect from UFOs in Nineteen sixty nine which was really a night cap publication but for the first time we got into the the occupation cases and uh\nAnd and and things like that but of course the main focus was to get to ...\nNineteen sixty six Nineteen sixty eight and he has a great hopes for the University of Colorado\nA UFO project matter of fact I call my chapter on that liar liar pants on fire the University of Colorado us food products project because the way I'm just symptom of disarray aims of our um\nOut of some of our best cases and I'm In the long run they just almost completely ignored them\nI remember when the con did report came out and who do you lose\nThat was January of Nineteen sixty nine now and from that\nTime on all the funding for a night cap a went out and then a a a there was not kept staff member who was also had the CIA connections and\nI think the CIA had been trying to take it over a for some time of course Roscoe Ellen quarter who was the first chairman of the night cap board after kill took over a was the first director of the CIA\n[laughter] yeah yeah what do you think that she wanted to do like just wash it\nWell I think that's part of it but at the same time I think they wanted to keep it going as long as they had control over it\nAnd um but ... didn't believe that even they call of didn't believe that I tried to persuade him that there was a a staff member named Stuart Nixon\nWho had a who had a practically admitted to me that he was a CIA plant and but the date for some reason didn't want to believe it\nUm which which struck me kind of I'm\nOff balance because I'm\nActually that was the one that before I ever came on board I think it was sixty four maybe sixty three were to CIA agents came into the office and they went through the night kept files of thoroughly over a period of several hours and um\nSo I think they knew all along that uh you know but they have a certain amount of control over it\nBut uh and and kill a\nI don't know I I just don't know how much key oh really new I really believe that it was a CIA took I think he believed the CIA was\nWilling to let my cab continue\nUm as long as they can monitor\nIt as long as they could ... right and I I think he was shocked to as I was when he and I were suddenly fired at the end of Nineteen sixty nine who fired you\nAre but um I think it was a ...

met with him yeah yeah\nYeah I uh I heard something about that actually I met Harry Truman oneself to his titles story behind that it wasn't about UFOs but he actually came to my father's a marina and Nineteen forty\nEight and it was shortly after a Puerto Rican nationalist tried to assassinate him home I remember the ... and\nUh my father asked if um if we can make the president because that that can actually told us he was on board and uh so I said well\nWait I'll ask him and he came back out he says while he can't come out outside and make themselves sane by every body because uh you know it the situation yeah and so I'll tell you what\nCome on a board so we came aboard he says he'll shake your hand you know what he did he shook his hand through an open port hall on the coast guard cutter

is eight four four six eight seven seven six six nine we'd like you to call and be part of our discussion later in the program\nTonight we're talking with Richard Pryor as Richard is a research and development scientist specializes in solar energy and the question is can we power a hundred percent of the planet\nWith solar energy Richard welcome to be on reality radio it's great to have you on here with us tonight\nGood evening I'm actually going on so what's started by um I guess we'll start with learning a little bit more about you tell us about yourself where where are you professionally and how did you get involved in this particular part of science\nA been a solar energy told her that the thirty years' in my life got started in the eighties one very few people who are involved in that I'm not\nExpert on the industry and the the progress in science since then and now we're reaching a point quite very close to two exploding in uh Indiana oh gee well\nI'd say ten to Fifteen Years from now it's gonna be the the major uh industry that you see energy on Senate or in the U.S on the whole country on the planet\nI'm Sorry what did you see the timeframe was that you expected that\nI'd say ten to Fifteen Years all that\nNow I'm you know I just saw a report today and I mentioned in in the first segment that I'm OPEC is saying that they expect oil to hit a hundred dollars a barrel again in the last time we were in that territory we had economic virtual economic collapse\nNot just in the United states but around the world um it was one of the major reasons we went into freefall for a while um you know when we see things like that how much does that provide a catalyst in motivation for these alternative technologies likes or\nTo um be invested in developed and actually brought to the point where they are and economically viable alternative\nI think it it helps set up but not necessarily a I think at forty dollars a barrel will they be cheaper five years from now ... spoke of getting the cheapest way of making it it took\nEffect today today to make a a kid or whatever well with the lowest cost way of doing it just called me to hold it will take solar cell the only drawback\nIt's nuts yet we exploding is that solar energy and not\nControllable it's not the actual silly each works with the weather so we have to they have all of the ways of transforming than liable energy into from our generation\nBut it's a they have some pretty good way of doing that and I like good fading light intellectual\nHating as well is that tend to have you know some nights going to be it's going to the solar driving the economy so\nGood I was just gonna say did I hear you correctly even as it stands right now the least expensive way to produce a kilowatt of electricity is through a solar energy\nToday yes but if you have to remember that that's kinda what he's he's\nCaught in the ... strain that comes with the weather so you have the ... when the sunshine\nAnd if the problem with that the economy needs took you know what it means that you know what that night all in the winter on a cloudy day\nSo transforming that very cheap you know what that we can already make today into something that can be twenty four seven there is a gap money trade gap there that's that's why the invention stopped taking place now the creativity is going off\nWhen GV and I talked about that are actually last week talking about that and one of the biggest problems with solar is if it's cloudy out what's happening or you're not able to I\nI have stolen or that I used to recharge my a boat batteries and and the nature and the end of course I'm constantly judging the voltage coming out of it and if it's if it's a cloudy day I'm getting nowhere near the power we are but I Am wondering what the sunny day\nAbsolutely that's why you have to do just that easy to get out of the books thinking um they'll they'll fall ways of making a that Saudi ... fell at night you know what are they able to you all the time\n... to spread out the results because it's always sunny somewhere so you use that joke but I think he's pushing to bring the power of unity and we have a very strong at a trickle network in this country it would not would not have to make it much stronger out to carry solar power of a\nDistance he's from sunny place to another sunny place that's number one I think some of the only solution number two is of course so energy storage\nBatteries are getting better and cheaper\nThat the id and seeing those units are getting cheaper and cheaper it probably would would get them and spend more yeah smaller and smaller because they are more efficient shake them come from all the sun into electricity\nWhen I get started you could convert about ten percent\nOf incoming solar energy into electricity today the best ... not not in the last\nThing the thing that you can actually buy hunting stole nail approaching twenty five twenty five percent commission\nSo Richard um any of those solutions that you mentioned to solve the problem that some places just don't have nearly as much sun and I think you're an old are you in Albany New York\nI'm In Albany New York and I'm In I'm In Cooperstown New York we don't get a lot of sun here I'm so any of these solutions I Would imagine you have to have some type of storage capability there has to you and your battery involved right yeah\nYeah storage he's the he's the glue so but it's not an old story and if you if you're going to have on these storage\nIt's going to be hopelessly expensive it cannot be done so you have to have the same old commission of spreading out the ... strengthening the breed over building your TV having storage on the phone solution one thing that helps also has to\nWeigh in some form of solar energy although it's it's ... so energy that it is still used by the sun indirectly it's combining a solar and wind so you can take advantage of the\nThe fact that they are valuable than it in different ways and they tend to complement each other or when when you when you\nCombine those full solutions together you get to assume show which is rather inexpensive than on the cusp of being commercially very attractive to deliver a twenty four seven a sign on to the markets\nIf we had um a solar array that was powering our homes now would we are we talking about every home has its own system that independent of others are we talking about is connected\nNow that has to be connected ... and you're talking to someone who was\nAt a solar system on their house from my out all the last twenty five years [noise]\nSo I used to be the homeowner and in fact I uh I have a mixed these semi ... N.Y a medic trick or not I\nYeah a hundred percent solo I I've seen my car with solar power I commute some solar electricity\nOn but\nIn reality T. I'm not a hundred percent stolen us he has he got on the greatest should take like says son on a cloudy day to buy back so having every solo Holmes totally independent cut off from the green on living in the legal system\nThat's not going to work [noise] no go ahead and we need to interrupt but I don't take advantage of the grade and one one example I gave all the ways to two people left me around all the money that could\nCause security sold on the ... hotel then yeah you can't we can't do that a state that I think the Bronx things Queens New York and there is no way I don't know what they are they are too many\nPeople not enough space so we have to design the solar system of the future to be able to study the power to those major centers of consumption do because otherwise it's going to the only marginal solar\nDo we have a sense is I'm sure the math has been done and I'm sure you know what it is um what is the surface area the space required for a solar panel to be able to provide enough power per capita per individual\nI Would have to do the D. V. D. version per individual but I I've done a year we are followed them in fact when just get a paper published today with that number wrong in solar energy Jonah sudden I'm going to open he doesn't speak\nTo two hundred percent solo fall called the United states\n\nSo bear with me a second sure new information hot off off the ... journal hot over the press [laughter] I have to open that figure ... ...\nYeah well Richard is looking for that to remind you the phone numbers aid for four six eight seven seven six six nine I Would love to hear from anyone who is installed solar panels in their home currently in what they you know what benefits they're seeing how much it's made a difference in their ... economics of their home\nAnd I and I can attest to that a very close friend of mine Jeremy ... it's been a big investment on having a they put on his house and now he he was telling me a few weeks ago that his average electric bill might be anywhere from\nNine dollars to thirty something dollars a month with what you're used to be two in change be and you can put the waste that up I guess she sells it back to the electric car yeah and so forth\n... find David jewels Ryan I my electric DTs essentially zero zero all year round so\nThat I Know and everybody cannot\nDo that like ... yeah and then well enough to actually getting ready to put a device on his house it will actually follow the sun it'll actually turned the solar panel to to follow this non where it is at that time of the day\nShow that's that's one way of doing it so I I have that number okay from the paper we just published today and it's twenty\nTwo thousand square feet on matters so to go back to square miles to divide by two point five so about ten thousand square lines\nSo it would require it today with today's technology all the anti us it would require I'm Sorry what was the ... how many square miles a day ten twelve thousand square on\nTen to twelve thousand square miles of surface area with panels on them to um to power the United states as it is today that includes industrial Mitt need everything\nEverything it doesn't include if you add transportation or electric transportation to that you can lead to try that number by sixty percent said it looks like a big number\nCan you put it into context able it's roughly the size of the ... high intensity urban development it's about the same size so high density deadline it's about one third of the size of medium density of and never mentioned to us\nSo now but the ramifications on that there was a there was actually a video that was going around the people we're ... we're looking at a while back and it was of these birds that seemed to miraculously be just exploding while they're in the air and come to know\nThat you're you're talking up another technology here which which will not work which is too expensive and you're talking about the concentrating towers okay well you have the the mirrors focusing on a tower on making two thousand degree temperature boiling water on making steam turbines work\nSo that technology is way too expensive to live as somebody totally different than yeah and the birds flying now of course ...\nYeah exactly oh and my question was with with that many solar panels though I I'm actually in solar panels on homes and everything and they do give off a very reflective look I think you'd agree with\nThat does that would be no more than a window [noise] oh okay well All right I always thought it was more it's not like a mirror but uh no\nInterest in how they should not be arrested if you think about it the solar panel needs to take ... or ... so it's we reflect see me sending energy back he doesn't want to do that so that the ideal ... we're not leave or ethnic TV it's going to try to take in as much as he's gotten on converting to electricity so\nIt'd be definitely different than a lot of the ones that are out there now with America\nYes the the best ... dog black can they'll they'll last Rafik teams in the old one that was shiny I in fact my ... shining this on the new one I have a very ... group now\nWe're talking with Richard ... research and development scientist specializing in solar energy can we power a hundred percent of our energy needs across the globe with solar energy that's our discussion tonight or on the phone number\nIs eight four four six eight seven seven six six Megan toll free day for four six eight seven seven six nine and we'd like to hear from you if if you deal with solar if you if your house was powered by solar and and so forth give us show it was ...
