to George and great to join you\nI was just mentioning climate week with just wrapped up in New York wow and what do they do anyway\n[noise] well they they had a lot of people there are a lot of dignitaries their goals from the website where that they were run it to a race ambition reduce climate change and accelerate climate action\nOr some big notable Tony Blair former prime minister England spoke ... moved from the United nations um actor Hugh Jackman\nWho the rain man the Wolverine spoken so quite a quite a big group also a big public relations steely claim a five hundred thirty five million people were reached in three hundred and news articles\nWritten so a a kind of an interesting thing but uh I Would and and a lot of folks there I think believe that if they change a light bulbs they can save polar bears ...\nIf we all drive electric cars we can stop the oceans from rising and if we build a whim turban towers we can make the storms less frequent and less severe and George we live in a in a modern age of superstition or there's really no empirical evidence to support those sorts of beliefs\nSo they are definitely man made global warming proponents aren't they they are well one and I have never been a fan of that because you know I think one Steven I think you agree were polluting the planet there's no question about that and we need to fix that\nThere's ... and it affects that's\nCorrect I don't think the pollution is causing what they say man made climate change I think we're in solar cycles a I think this this planet or has been warmer during the dinosaur days and we didn't have cars and all the carbons in the atmosphere and anything like that\nAre at least for periods of the last ten thousand years when it was warmer matter of fact it was about two to three degrees Celsius warmer according to a geologist eight thousand years ago when we've been gently cooling since then although temperatures go up and they go down\nAnd you know the other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are conflicting without\nQuote real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment\nThe other thing about pollution as you say we were ah many people are conflicting with a quote real air pollution that can harm people or harm the environment things like carbon monoxide nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide the mercury\nParticulates with carbon dioxide which is a odorless harmless invisible gas and when I speak to groups I like to say to him what to cannabis growers know that the climate scientists apparently don't know\nWhy do you believe that there are so many proponents man made climate change\nWell it it's a bit of a long story back in Nineteen eighty eight Dr James Hansen of NASA came and testified before Congress and they it was on a very hot summer day and he said he was Ninety nine percent sure that\nThe earth was warming in humans were causing as he was a computer model or\nAnd within a year and a half the United nations form Intergovernmental Panel on climate change and just three years later we had forty one nations in the European\nCommunity signed a treaty saying they would reduce greenhouse gases so in my opinion of the first thing is that uh the world kind of jumped to a conclusion quickly on this\nBut uh you know for the last Thirty years or so\nThe computer models have been predicting very fast warming and we haven't seen it temperatures have warmed just a little\nStorms aren't strong or the polar bears are doing fine\nAnd then the second factor though is I think a much of this was being driven forward by momentum by money uh we have a wind and solar and biofuel industries we have deans of sustainability at the university's vice president sustainability corporations\nAnd there are over there is over two hundred fifty billion dollars a year spent every year on renewables to try and stop the planet from warming so the first is the world jumped to a conclusion second is there's there's just a huge amount of money momentum behind all of this\nAmazing what's going on lately the last couple of days have been talking about here's a one or two degrees affecting everything what's going on with that\nWell you know that is really remarkable to I uh Jay Inslee a governor of Washington state\nJust to post an article and CNN quote how does show Trump you care about climate change and he's made statements saying that the forests are a lot warmer and that's why we're we're seeing these forest fires well we've had that one degree of warming in the last hundred and Thirty years one degree in\nDenver yet and I think it came from the sun while I Do too\nBut that come straight from the climate research unit at East Anglia in England the the number one authority on this one degree so so in the last decade maybe we've had attempted degree in ... in Washington for a send to say that all these forest fires are caused by a tenth of a degree change I mean that just doesn't make any sense\nSo people need to get a little perspective there's probably other bigger factors at work um the way we take care of her forests are for example\nAre you concerned Steve that we're headed down the wrong direction here with climate change\nOh absolutely this is a tremendous miss allocation of resources as you say there are\nThere are major pollution issues to be solved today eighty percent of the world's wastewater is discharged untreated into lakes rivers and streams the ocean if you remember a few years ago and Brazil the swimmers didn't want to swimming in the water\n'em and they're just building the first water treatment plants down in Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion\nUm and they're just building the first water treatment plants down and Brazil so that's a real problem we need to solve we have two billion people trying to live on to US dollars a day one point two billion don't have\nA a electricity we have two point five billion without proper sanitation millions die from disease yet we're spending all this money to try and keep the planet from warming and the bottom line is the planet is dominated by natural factors as you say oceans whether driven by the sun\nIt's unlikely that we're going to be able to make a measurable difference with all the things you're doing in California and everywhere else on global temperatures\nThere's no question that the you know the the the groups that are pro or con what's happening with climate change keep butting heads\nWhen I'm beginning to see at least more scientists beginning to feel the way you do that we're dealing with a different kind of climate change well\nIf you again if you look at ... at any of the well any of the uh the predictions about climate change and you see a lot of articles he saw articles written about\nUm what was Hurricane Florence ... and last year we had a couple of major hurricanes ah we had Harvey hit Texas ah we had another one hit I think it was Irma hit Florida\nBut if you look back at history this has happened before we've had a twelve years since Nineteen hundred when two or more major hurricanes have made landfall in the United states these are this is really nothing new\nA hundred and Seventy hurricanes made landfall during the twentieth century other ... and if you look at the actual evidence you don't see that's storms are either getting more frequent are stronger\nOr the U.S government also has data on a droughts and floods if you look for the lower forty eight states over the last hundred years there's no indication we're seeing more floods are more droughts we had more droughts in the Nineteen thirties [noise] we have three times the polar bears that we had a uh in Nineteen sixty\nSo the the dire consequences are just not occurring as people are predicting and people still write these articles but they never showed data comparing the past to the president\nWhen we come back let's talk specifically about your new book outside the green block Steve ... linked up the coast to coast am dot com ... for you first name Steve G. O. R. E. H. A. M. dot com ... ...\n... the new version of the coast to coast am map is now available for I'm bone in now enjoyed ... ... on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today\nOn seconds on you know I Hope you coast to coast too yeah on Jay accent tea\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast will take your calls next hour regardless of your thoughts on whether the global warming climate change we don't muscle you because people have different views Steve the book outside the green box told me about the timing for\nSure well that's this is a book that tells you what your green consultant doesn't tell you a written for general audiences and businesses and a one popular business a phrase use over and over and think outside the box so the\nTitle was think outside the green bucks because businesses today are are really trapped in the green boxes sustainable development there they are forced to do many things ah that don't really do anything for the environment\nAnd so I go through a what I call first before horsemen of environmental apocalypse a which are overpopulation the idea that humans are growing too fast and and populating the planet too fast or the second one is global pollution the idea that we're increasingly polluting the environment\nOf the third is climate destruction uh and the fourth is a resource depletion those for fears are really at the basis of all of a or state and federal laws about energy\n'em and they're taught in the universities and taught in a high schools but if you look at the actual trends you find out that none of those really is a significant problem they've all been exaggerated to a very very big extent so\nI discuss the Fort Worth ... and then I talk about what happens in is happening in different industries or energy materials agriculture a et cetera but it's a fun to read it say a color paperback and uh\nOr energy materials agriculture or et cetera but it's fun to read it say a colored paper back in a\nGot a lot of color side bars and a lot of great quotes and also about a a eight hundred notes in the back so people can go deeper was\nAway for size it's a heavy blonde\n[laughter] well I don't know about that but there's lots of reasons why we put it that way also hired a cartoonist got a nice cartoon at the front of every chapter which kind of summarizes some of the stuff in the chapter so it's a good read\nMore weeds climate change with what's happening I'm a I'm told that the United states today is the world's largest oil producer again have you on\nYeah that happened last uh last month or so we passed up Russia we had passed Saudi Arabia about four or five months ago amazed that\nIs could be temporary because Saudi Arabia's ... talking about turning out a lot of ... additional oil production but uh we're growing very fast the the miracle of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has turned the U.S into the world's energy powerhouse [noise] and uh yeah we're the biggest producer of crude no\nNo I Believe in Thomas schools theory of abiotic oil that the planet is gone in abundance of oil which was natural when the planet was formed it's not just made up of dinosaurs in plants\nI tend to think that way to a matter of fact the Russians have said that for a long time but we know natural gas can be created by all sorts of things including a you know camels and horses and cows and everything else and and many people think deep within the earth\nOf the earth also produces a materials like gas and other things I saw I think there's probably a combination of of something that is fossilized fuel but others others that do come up from the ... of the earth I Do believe that so I I Try not to use the phrase a phrase fossil fuels I like to use that comes into hydrocarbons instead\nYou know one of my simple theories on why the ... theory is the ... theory is because most of the oil that has pumped on this planet it's way way down there oh yeah in Lansing dead animals get down there\nThey're finding now below twenty thousand feet of rock yeah\nSome of these very deep wells they find oil and you got to kind of wonder the other thing is that a lot of it has been you know found in the polar regions too and and uh those regions tend not to have as much a plant life but I Know we have shipped shifting of the polls and other things that can occur but yeah I I Do think it's a\nIt probably is a combination of factors and maybe it is being produced down down in the ... of the earth what\nIs the argument about overpopulation and then it's a major problem for all of us yeah so\nNineteen fifty um we had this huge population growth rate or across the world in up in until\nIt got up to be about a three percent per year by Nineteen Seventy you know the big reason for that was we had declining um infant mortality had declining death rates as we solved all these disease problems\nAnd so a bunch of people like Paul Ehrlich of population bomb fame said that hundreds of millions of people are going to starve to death and the Nineteen seventies the Nineteen eighties [noise] but they didn't\nUh first we had a global agricultural revolution and even though population grew to seven billion at it more than doubled up by two thousand and five we had triple the agricultural output but the other thing nobody else saw is that the fertility rates have been dropping the fertility\nRate is a number of of ah children a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average is having five children during her ...\nChildren a woman will have in her lifetime and back in Nineteen fifty for the world each woman on average was having five children during her lifetime will today that has dropped down to two and a half\nThat said dropped in half and the reason is we have a society moving from an agricultural into a industrial and then a technological a sort of a state we have more women entering the workforce there waiting to have children they're having smaller families\nSo all none of this was for seen it all occurred and the great news is that uh we're probably going to get the global zero population growth within about fifty or seven years and so we're getting to a soft landing on on the population issue\nAnd the benefit yesterday Steve in downtown Los Angeles for the red cross in Philly you can't fly in a as we were driving to get to the venue I saw things that I haven't seen in years you know because I spend a lot of time in St Louis\nI saw so many homeless people living in tents on the side of the room with more garbage in young Ruth strewn all over the place\nNice where's that was his and he ... in Los Angeles yeah I you know looking how homeless\nPeople in in in the county of Los Angeles there are so that really is a tough situation\nWould you would you call waste dump them or you wear a solution\n[noise] uh it certainly is it it certainly is a litter problem as a minimum but yeah probably pollution you know the other thing though if I might if I might comment the government to California keeps making housing more expensive\nYou know you now have to every new residents has to have solar cells and I understand they're they're gonna twang everything they have a electric car plug in\nSo you just add about twenty thousand dollars to the price of every home every residents of California does isn't really going to help the problem\nNo you're absolutely right what would you recommend that people start doing personally to combat the situation [noise]\n... ... people and businesses or you know actually a waste is actually a pretty good news problem as far as what's going in the land fills\nA that piqued about Nineteen Ninety in the United states is now starting to trend down we're doing more recycling um but uh businesses need to reduce real pollutants that we've touched on before\nUm nitrogen dioxide sulfur dioxide particulates et cetera are not carbon dioxide\nUm so uh the the efforts to reduce that really I mean again carbon dioxide\nIs what they're pumping into greenhouses and California to make their cannabis crop grow\nA bigger and faster its its plant food\nAnd it's right or the idea that ah that CEO to as harmful is crazy and and people always show you these\nPictures that where you have this dirty looking air over China if you can see the error that's not causing global warming all of the major global warming gases a greenhouse gases number one is water vapor that's the biggest greenhouse gas to as carbon dioxide three is a methane those\nAre all invisible so if you can if you can see the air you gotta clean that up but the greenhouse gases are are really not causing air pollution and so we need we need to get our our uh aimed at the real pollutants air and water and and quit trying to stop the planet from warming\nSteve you talked about in people coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of upheaval is this\nWell we've had a ... a basically a rape\nYou talked about in upheaval coming in energy and climate regulations what what kind of ... ...\nYeah well we've had a ... a basically a rate payer revolts now in Australia just this last summer in Australia um\nWe had a a Scott Morris and take over as the uh the new a minister\nOf Australia Malcolm Turnbull was turned out and leaving the opposition was former prime minister Tony Abbott who is called for withdraw from the Paris accords\nUm the prime minister Morrison says is number one priority is to reduce power prices while we keep the lights on wait a similar thing up and Ontario by the way both Australia and Ontario electric rates have gone through the roof more than doubled over the last ten years\nKind of I'm pushing their

that we solve that problem by giving them money I don't think that's the right way I think the way is to uh\nIs to ah help ah teach 'em to use free markets and a property rights and um a lot of other sorts of things that would help those economies to grow and you know the good news is that\nA those are those are people are growing\nA we have about a about a I think it's about six hundred million people now that are under nourished across the world uh uh that's uh that's about the little less than ten percent of the world's population used to be thirty percent Thirty years ago\nSo are people are are getting more nourishment uh they're getting\nPercent of the world's population used to be thirty percent Thirty years ago so are people are are getting more nourishment or they're getting more food famine has been basically eliminated um it used to be that every decade twenty million people across the world would die from famine that was in the early Nineteen hundreds\nNow every decade it's less than a million people died so we are making a lot of progress but I didn't want to suggest that we just ship them money [laughter] uh you're right on that\nLet's go to another caller barbers in Los Angeles hey barb welcome to the program good to have you with us\nI I haven't seen the thing they can tasked with gas fine and you can test\nFor a while and there's a lot of work being done with our ten and then a king and you have faith that frequent guest on your head David Brown with alcohol and dad and his outfit to um\nTake with that and then second ... Oklahoma has more earthquakes in way dealing California from oil drilling fracking primarily and\nActually that is true they are having more earthquakes but it isn't really fracking it is the it's the injection of the wastewater from fracking that is causing those are like well that's what I mean by the ... yeah well you're right indirectly it is\nBut uh they're working other other places where we can inject water all all day it's that's a really a problem to be solved by geologist or they need to tell us where we can safely inject water where we camped and then uh and then will reduce the possibility of quakes\nYour possibility Steve that this entire plan is to just have some horrendous catastrophe that something could happen just shattered the planet to\nAbsolutely it could you know I I Hope that never happens and and you know all we can do though with with these things is adapt that's what we\nWhat we do with the storms that's we do with the sea level rise we've been doing that for a thousands of years uh there's really no evidence that we can control the climate we can do something locally with temperatures and locally but what with weather but not on a global scale\nI'm very unlikely that we can control the climate at this point\nTo British Columbia Canada we go to the first time caller Terri Hi Terry thanks for calling\nFellow man that's a good night to be having this discussion I most appreciate it\nA George ... first than if the current ages the information age use or are the cutting edge and you have my total respect thing to you Mr Gura them I say I am the Lone Ranger [laughter] I have lost most of my credibility\nKiller researcher but people think I'm Crazy or heated and bringing up these these arguments that you do it means nothing ... there's\n... boom warming is a very sexy position\nBecause people feel smart and that if I just you know save my balls or do whatever I'll save the planet and [laughter]\nI'm sure you've heard before but a big thing that I Love to bring up in this totally discredited in our life list are going to address this or the Ninety thousand cargo ships at sea they're pumping Sulphur into the air\nThat must have a profound effect on 'em\nWell there is there there is an issue right now I'm cargo ships use fairly high sulfur fuel fairly for dirty fuel um and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but ah\nIt was fairly high sulfur fuel fairly for dirty fuel um and I think the uh I Can't remember which organization is but the but the international organization on shipping\nHas actually agreed to go move to some different a lower so for fuel types and a lot of folks in the industry think that it's going to be a problem it's probably a good step though so I'm generally in favor of moving to lower so for fuel overtime\nUm there's a lot of people also talking about cutting greenhouse gases from ships though it primarily carbon dioxide I think that probably is not such a good idea\nBut that is one of those real real pollution problems that need to clean up we also need to do a little ah improve uh the problem with the litter of plastic and the oceans that's\nAnother issue that we need to work out in the lord as Asian was the international maritime organization\nThank you that's [laughter] that's it they're predicting that the the increase is going to be a huge uh in the next several years by twenty fifty you've no action is taken the increase by up to two hundred and fifty percent not to jump the sulfur yeah [noise]\nUh possibly so yeah I I couldn't really comment on that but I think so I think that's probably a good step\nLet's go to Bruce in Portland, Oregon Hi Ruth go ahead\n[noise] [noise] Hi how you and your you and thank you for filling in my blank spaces that I have no control over that hands\n[laughter] okay no\nI'm Serious I'm begging is I think we ought to pay it forward um right now and if they can give us some kind of a of a plan that they can make our world more free I'm\nLike my aunt paying it forward now putting our technology and in in a place where we can\nBring our energy you where it all in the free for everybody that would be great and I think they can do it\nAnd that might be he is asking if you are here donate you making our our uh dams in a\nEcosystem better and I've done that we're looking at it even even the little people out here like me and in bed is bigger than I can pay it forward right now I think that we all can live free I mean without anything\nThat would be great but Steven they're going to want to make money on this some aren't they\nI mean one of the great points that I talk about in the uh the second chapter of outside the green boxes the rise of democracy or the United states basically was the first modern democracy now we have\nUh just about I think it's almost Ninety nations that have that have a form of democratic government so it's going from zero to Ninety nations\nAnd with that you know we get the benefits of legal equality and freedom of speech religion rule of law limitation of slavery women's suffrage personal property rights a lot of other things so the world is getting freer\nOh that's a very positive thing and it's all part of this idea that everybody is better off there's a lot of people going around saying the world's gonna collapse overpopulation we've got pollution we've read all these terrible things\nBut people are healthier lives and and one aspect of that is the rise of democracy\n... what do we do with people because this to me is one of the most heartbreaking situations people who cannot afford electricity or their gas or let's say it's the dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it\nWhat do we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nThe dead of winter and it's going to get shut off because they can't afford it\nDo we do with those kinds of folks I mean it's it's sad\nYeah that's a tough situation actually United States is in better shape than many European places because uh we have very low cost electricity um [noise]\nA price us here in the United states they often put up a graph comparing Europe almost all your the nations in Europe is higher or electricity prices and we have here in the United states we have the lowest cost natural gas in the world right now we're the biggest petroleum producer\nBut we should we said though that nobody nobody gets shut off during implement weather or can we say that\nI Am not going to get into that I Do think many of the the uh the utilities have that sort of policy that they're\nEither not allowed to do that by law they have a policy where they're not going to do that during equipment weather and they tend to postpone things in the summer I think\nFour hundred seven one four or five\nOne eight hundred four hundred\nFour hundred seven one four or five that's one eight hundred four hundred seven one four or five one eight

welcome back on final segment with Stephen Moore I'm Steve when you're out of vents what seems to be the question that most people want answered\n\nWell um there are many um\n[noise] you know I speak a lot to businesses and one of the things I run across as they they tell me you're preaching to the choir [laughter] yeah but the funny thing is though they don't realize that the majority of us business\nThinks that the climate was on the energy laws are foolish in many ways\nThe headlines or grab by a lot of the big companies like apple and Google and uh the political leaders but but the kind of the rank and file of of American business um thinks a little bit different but they don't realize that they're in the majority\nAre so it's a little bit of a strange situation\nUm [noise]\nLet's see what are some of the other major questions why why are all the climate models wrong is some is uh something that people come up with and that has to do with some of the assumptions\nUm are they concerned about anything\n[noise] [noise] well they've you know back in Nineteen Ninety the uh United Nations and the inter governmental panel on climate change predicted that a temperatures would rise three tenths of a degree Celsius per decade\nOr with a mix of five tense and low of two tenths and if you put those on a chart\nThose rights pretty fast but over the last Thirty years we we are much less than that so we're\nWe're below the estimates of the United nations that they made in Nineteen Ninety we're not seeing the the rice that was forecasted which basically says the assumptions that the climate models are wrong and natural factors dominate global temperatures\nLet's go to Joe in Long Island New York he used to the Rockies Hey Joe go ahead\nSteven thrusting show uh actually I Want climate change I wanted to be warmer but [laughter] Alaskans\nA and a comment a got a quick uh my first question would be a we just had a factor in Indonesia unfortunately and they said that they weren't really warm that that was supposed to be a week and that was working with a papal cut up\nAnd they said that they weren't really warn\nThat that was supposed to be a week and that was working with the people cut our job on this thing\nSo I I relate this to a ocean temperatures how well monitored all ocean temperatures and the satellites come into play with anything to do with that the second question would be\nA the political climate you know ... ... talk about the last couple of weeks twenty four seven as the uh you\nKnow Brett Kavanaugh are in his shoes and ... and um you know it does make me think that the senators\nDon't have time to study science never or the interest and really don't have a good grasp of science maybe they took one course thirty forty fifty years ago and science and never really updated themselves on their own\nUh and uh you know I don't want to pick on trial is already gotten blame for the recent hurricane or in the Washington Post and then my comment would be uh you said the nuclear ... or a industry uh was traditional\nAnd I think it's a like a lot of people are a potential disaster waiting to happen and I know it doesn't contribute to climate uh increase CEO too if you look at Chernobyl\nThat's still only buried it's still a lot of it's never been contained nobody can go within fifty miles of the place all these years later\nSo uh you you take New York for example you got to the point right now and I'm a big metro area or something that happened with that then what happens in New York City\nSo you got a whole bunch of things that are I think there were three of them one was what are we doing with ocean temperature measurements the uh the national oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has I think they're the ones who put out these diving\nUm a measuring devices I forget the name of them again but they have thousands of 'em out there now but\nAh they've only been deployed for about a twelve to Fifteen Years so we really only have data on the ocean temperatures are from measurements are over the last twelve to Fifteen Years before that it was just you know people will take them and ships and kind of measurements are going around and those were very accurate\nThe um\nThe thing you said about ... uh what's um let's see ... the third one was the nuclear plants I think one of the big issues with nuclear plants that they need need to solve its they need to be able to shut down automatically\nWe still have plants and most of the ones around the world that are relying on cooling systems in the cooling systems fail fail\nLike happened with the Saddam in Japan and then we have a chance for a big melt down so that problem needs to be solved um the other big problem with nuclear is is just frankly natural gas is so darn cheap right now nobody will build a nuclear plant and I think the third one was um\nSatellites well you said something about governments and what's your question yeah I'm\nSaying I I think you know him and I read or undefeated about five times in the U.S Congress I think the majority of ah arguably more than half of the United states so members of Congress right now do not think global warming is a dangerous problem out most of those around the Republican side of course\nAnd as I mentioned we have we have we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia in Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this\nYeah we have we now have a climate revolts if you will in Australia and Ontario so I think I think political leaders are starting to get it uh this has been a disaster crisis for more than Twenty years now and we're really not seeing the disaster so I'm hopefully I've covered most of your issues\nI think the biggest problem we've gone as an ex clear from the sun that could wipe out our power grid in the run duress useless wherever that\nThat's possible probably a big explosion there again if the if all those ... go off in Antarctica and milk to big bunch of ... the south of the of the peninsula down there that could be an issue there's many many things that could occur\nUm again we need to adapt as well we scan and the biggest one is an ice age boy I liked this warm weather folks I Do not want to see the start of the studies that\nWe've got we've got against Robert Felix who believes were in the early stage of an ice age\nBirthday who knows Walter in Pennsylvania and taken away well go ahead\nBy Georgia needless to say Greg did talk to you once again George thank you water\nShortages out with all due respect Mr Gura sounds a lot like a Dr Kim ball ...\nGeorge with all due respect to most of them I don't think that Dr Paul Ehrlich there has been discredited at all I think George I think it's just common sense\nAbout the human population on this planet cannot increase out in the NIH dumb now George we share this planet with myriad other species are not modern library culture I may have allowed a kid a man on the ancient a bane of law\nOf Simon but modern agriculture consumes much natural habitat that in Africa the human population is driving to yell at the station just as in this\nCountry are you know we have largely eradicated the great a herd of buffalo bites and\nOh so you know naturally you you could not twenty million\nUp the great\nBy sitting hers that used to be twenty million in a hurry you couldn't add them ah it would be compatible with the er agriculture where the ... horribly wrong we have law expansion fields of corn and soybeans and wheat so uh\nYou know I I just think it's common sense that the human population now\nCannot increase out in a lot of them\nWell there comes a point Steve is they're not then you know you can't have a population of twenty billion people on the planet\nNo you can't and and you make good points well but the the the uh predictions are now that we're going to level of about ten and a half billion there

I think some people misunderstand that\nI did a little disclaimer inside the cover and it was kind of a play on words\nBut uh basically what I said was in his marches big foot has not been deemed real these works over worker fiction and the point I was trying to make was in the eyes of the world everything\nAbout big foot is fiction for the most part what do you go before say the Patty film or to date after the Patty film or most of the world looks at these things with a wink and a nod\nI mean when I have conversations with people about a big foot when I have conversations with people about a UFOs\nYour typical conversation is that if somebody looking at you with a big grin on their face listening to what you have to say and then saying to you come on you don't really believe that\nThere was a guy who called the program years ago when our bill was still alive ... book any claim that he shot to ... ... and had them and of course\nI don't know what happened the guy you know definitely don't know what happened to the recorded ... what are those kinds of stories in your opinion on Senate or made a\nWell you know [noise] what are we talking about George we're talking about one person it's like a he said she said\nRight I Believe me the proof [noise] yeah I Believe that\nThese people have no ax to grind I heard that story a when a or did it and I'm thinking about it the man was not being paid\nHe could have easily just shut up and walked away he didn't\nHe wasn't trying to sell anything you know ah he was reporting\nWhat had happened and the fact was he like a lot of other people had a certain amount of guilt about it\nOr having seen it they really didn't know what to do with it they knew there was going to possibly be some repercussions\nAnd so they buried him a I've had a couple of encounters a where animals had been killed was said to have been killed one of them are wasn't self defence\nAnd ah this man solve this thing was going to kill him a and\nWhat are you to say about that am I to say you know you're wrong for doing that you should have you shouldn't have done that you shouldn't have pulled the trigger I mean I can only I Can't imagine\nThere and that's a difference than just going out into the wild to look for one to shoot it\nWell that's that's correct you know if he'd like I could um well I don't know let me let you continue I have so many things you or it could\nShow we will do them in we've got a break coming up in a couple of minutes your show up at\nUh like I said I have some people are who have seen bodies a couple of guys say they

basically golf cart so they could ride around rather a ...\nAnd they're you know trying to gain an upper hand on some of these I personally I think there shoveling against the tide [noise] but um [noise] people feel like they have a need to try to take some of these animals down\nA thankfully as they're doing it to me there's going to you know food kitchens and whatnot but it's a it's a real problem\nI had a call ... ... year ago\nFrom an individual who was fishing and he caught to trout and he said as soon as he kind of realize what was going on he saw a big forward\nLooking at him about eight feet away and he said he's holding the two trials the guy is in the big flood\nLooks at him and he went oh my God what am I going to do so in a panic he handed the to travel to the big foot in the big foot took them\nLooks at them and gave one back now does that sound real to you or do you think the guy called and made it up\nWell I'll be honest with you a that is most one of the most unreal\nStories or if I heard that I Would have discounted at a entirely however having said that I had a gentleman\nWas canoeing in Vermont and ah he had taken a lake in to a creek\nLet's hold on to

and\nAnd ah he was lining up some trout on Iraq near him as he was catching them maybe was camping on the side of the creek\nAnd there's plenty of course being the cook 'em up for dinner so he had caught a few brook trout late I'm On a rock and when he turned over Detroit we're gone now his first instinct was that a raccoon took more raccoons took them and\nWhen he turned over Detroit we're gone now\nHis first instinct was that a raccoon took more raccoons took them and I've actually had this happened to me fishing the connect quite river or wherever I heard a little Russell in the bushes and I turned to my head and a rainbow I had laying up on the side of the river\nOr I see a raccoon stick it says\nLook left and right grabbed it and went back into the grass so I Know this happens and that's what he thought\nSo a little later on he was putting more fish up there when he saw a long arm extend out at almost ground level\nAnd the huge hand grasp the pile of fish not just one fish in one school grab numerous fish and retracted back into the weeds and that when he saw that\nIt was game over because he knew this was something in the woods that he hadn't bargain for and the problem was that where it had reached out at ground level his tent was set up about fifty feet away from them so shortly thereafter that he\nGot the guts to go over there and repack up his tent and started to make his way out with the canoe but he had said that he thought it was a big ...\nObviously what else has a long hair rearm in a big hand standing out of the bushes and then he also realize that this thing had to have been crawling on its belly in other words will be sneaking along kind of like a soldier trying to sneak up\nIn Ninety company\nAnd was able to know that he was fishing saw him fishing sure what he was doing by placing these fish on the rock and then had positioned itself\nOr in such a way where it could get up there to get the fish and retreat back into the woods without being seen but according to him when\nHe saw the first group of fish missing\nHe was actually sitting on a rock smoking is pipe and he had his peripheral vision looking out towards the rock now now being mindful he wanted to catch the raccoons and the act was what he was not a raccoon at all\nAnd uh he was pretty he was pretty frightened off by that\nAnd intel on with these reports hotter people describe the creature in terms of height neuro big hobby\nYeah well it it really varies I Would say a minimum you're talking a seven feet tall a\nAnd I had a point you yeah [noise] yeah\nA lot of people say the comical shape Ted there's varieties of a a hair for coloration ranging from like salt and pepper\nChew a lot of people use the term or burned or read a and then of course brown and black so that seems to be a variety and then we have two different basically physique [laughter]\nUh it seems that you either have these kind of almost ... very early\nA beer like for lack of a better term and then there's the other one that appears again and again and it's described as being like a weightlifter or a ... you know Arnold Schwarzenegger or to the nth degree type of body extremely muscular\nOr was this you know Arnold Schwarzenegger to the tenth degree type of body extremely muscular a veto chest you know Bolger your thighs you know just like a real monster so these these are the things that people are seeing and then it just varies\nI had one I'm a one story called the tree stand a incident I named it with this fellow claimed that his trees stand who's twenty five feet in the tree which put his feet at something like twenty feet\nAnd this sasquatch and a group above the size watches it seemed that the group was distracting him making our own noises in the woods while he was bow hunting and he couldn't see because of the density of the trees and the fog that was laying in this valley in the early morning\nBut he had said he recognized as a hunter that these our noises will not real in other words they were being mimicked\nAnd as he was kind of paying attention to this and sorting out the pieces\nA sasquatch snuck up on him from the rear and jet Li grabbed the heel of his boo [laughter] think about how big this thing had to be even if he was wrong in this measurement\nNobody sits there trees stand ten feet off the ground I mean he said twenty five feet so what if he was at twenty feet and his feet or ... I don't know Seventeen something had to have tremendous height and reach but the amazing thing about that story was the\nWay he said that the creature gently grabbed his book\nAnd he jumped to the point where he almost fell out of the stand and when he looked down this thing was looking up at him and he commented how he almost what that is just wanted him to know that it can do that that they could sneak up on him and ...\nAnd then it left the scene and everything went quiet again\nYou know the name of your book big food here in the woods tell us about the terror portion what what's going on out there\nWell I mean first of all when we talk about terra or when we used the word bizarre uh in regards to big foot I ... I take the stand as to what is more terrifying\nIs it ... is it not enough terrifying to see a ten foot tall monster walking across the shoulder of the road or is it more terrifying to have one linking you in the woods or when you're hiking with your girlfriend\nThese things are out there they're frightening people\nA lot of the encounters a somewhat casual wear this scene from afar and then the people exit hastily but then there's other ... encounters where it's my opinion these things don't want the people to be where they are and\nThey seem to exhibit behavior that in my opinion they chasing the people out\nThey want to monitor the region and so they they\nDon't want them now and I think if you push the envelope a you're going to be in the sorry state of affairs a when you talk about this gentleman that said he had to fish and the the big foot walked over and he gave him to him [laughter] he gave him one back [laughter]\nGentlemen that said he had to fish and the the big foot walked over and he gave them to him [laughter] he gave them one by telling you right now George that big foot if I see that big foot I'm gonna get wheels like pop up on a Kansas\n[laughter]\nWe're going to speed up the film real and my legs are going to be turning like the wheels on a call running out of the\nWilliams does anybody ever report Bebe big foot\nI have a I Do have an account or this is very interesting another fisherman and here's the thing George I believe that\nAside from the accidental sightings which there are numerous ones the vast majority of these sightings of being hand by people who are out there doing things that your normal person when they say normal I don't mean like the abnormal normal but\nThey do and things are involved in things that the average person does not do the hunters that fishermen there in remote areas uh the loners they're people who are getting out and going into places for peace of mind to exercise whatever the case may be\nThe all new radio dot com app is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone\nFor anywhere\nFrom the justice of heart ... studios DAM north Las Vegas ...

I don't even know what to say about that you know and yet this is something that was passed on you\nTalked about mood knocking\nThat the people were hearing what's going on with that what's not so\nWell you know this is one of the things that we we see on the television a relative to a big foot people running around knocking on trees with bats and sticks\nOr they apparently believes that this is some type of communication are between big foot you knock they not back with the signaling each other in the woods but this is really odd this account came to me and to me if you believe this\nIt really disapproves of the board knocked because according to this couple a this guy's name was ... he was a [noise]\nA semi pro landscape photographer a and he and his wife were in an area called lower Crabtree meadows in twenty seven teams July so this was fairly recent\nThe two of them were walking into this area to take some panoramic pictures now some of this guy's pictures are actually on line\nFor sale so he says uh so he he also commented that I don't know when somebody is touted to be a professional but he had been doing it for twenty five years and never considered themselves to be a professional at any rate there in the valley taking pictures\nAnd there was nothing in the valley they hadn't seen any animals and then know el ... there was nothing around and they heard a loud knock emanates through the valley\nSo he's got his cameras set up on the tripod the wife has a pair of binoculars and she starts scanning around and sit through a husband I see something pacing around over there on the hillside and he says what do you mean you see something pacing she says I see something there's something\nOver there pacing around on the hillside\nTo lay the legs\nSo he swings this time around using a telephoto lens he's trying to look through there she's got it now he sees it\nHe says even though it was so small in his lens at the distance he was looking\nHe knew it was a big foot there was nothing else around there and he ... he described it as looking like a nervous man waiting for a bus this thing was just like pacing back and forth running it's arms up in the air I'm like you said the nervous man waiting for a bus\nSeemed very alert to\nYeah well a show then they're watching this thing it stand still raises its head up into the air like a howling wolf\nPuts his hands by its side just like you will I Would do mhm patrol voice forward and then they had been knock you know what I I Can't even do it but you know like if you click your tongue against through your mouth\n[noise] you've got at George is like only like you know a ...\nShow he said it wasn't the knock at all but it was more vocalization that the creature was able to do somehow with the it's wrote its tongue its mouth who knows you can ask him questions\nBut he said it was not a knock at all so then that was really interesting that somebody had caught such a thing you know\nIs it in your opinion is is it a blight gr man like\nI don't know George I you know ... aren't you here it's ... it's its own thing you know\nIt's all you know like in in a blue walked on Ford's very rarely will and he walked just standing up right it uses its arms and it's not colds yeah on a move along as a chimpanzee does too mhm this seems to stand up right all the time\nOr not so really yeah uh I mean people have encountered them\nUh hitting all fours\nWho would look like a beer to me you should do that\n[noise] yeah but a little different or I'll give you this is this is really a strange encounter a this was called the balloon is citing the balloons citing this guy had been given a gift certificate by his new wife for his birthday for balloon rod\nYou always wanted one I got a he was afraid of heights and his wife didn't know it [laughter] so ah the\n[laughter] ... they came one day went uh to meet up with this balloon is out in the field and uh he was scared out of his which split the he fought through it and they went for a ride and he asked the guy\nOr to try to keep the balloon as low as possible and the guy kind of weight to them and said you let me know when you get really comfortable and he said there were about five hundred feet drifting over this farmland and more land\nBut he is what happens which is really a unusual they got to a point in their flight there were other people in the ... with them by the way it was like just him and his wife to probably five or six people in there\nThey got to a point where the pilot or the balloon lowered the balloon over all wooded area so that the ... was scraping the branches\nAnd they came down and did that and everybody was cheering and everything you know ... trying to ...\nThe tree and all of this then he'd lifted it back up again\nAs they made it across the next field he did it once again he lowered it down and they just moving slowly along scraping the tree up and they all started cheering now he said you'd think they won the lottery the way the people who are carrying it on and it's gone viola but here\nWhere the big foot comes in when they're scraping over the second series of trees that was bordering a field\nBusting out of the tree line as the balloon is guided along gliding along comes this big foot he starts out walking quickly looking over his shoulder and the guy said I Swear he was looking directly at me\nEverybody said look at that and one lady snapped a picture of the thing\nThat kept quiet and you can't control the balloon this fellow said that after this thing think took several you know very long and fast strides walking\nIt hit the deck on all fours and took off he hid it looked like a racehorse at the Belmont raise you see that's unusual isn't it\nWell I I mean you know I've heard of this I I have a story and one of the books that cold along came a spider\nWhere these guys were hog hunting so here we go back I told you I had some accounts of ... feral hog on the on\nThese guys were hog hunting and they were sitting in a field uh coming up on dust ... waiting for the Hong Kong to come down out of the trees that were already some out in the field they were in the tall grass\nAnd the grass was sporadically patched in other words there were clear areas and areas of hide glass of grass working your way around the field they sure what he described as a furry army homemade sticking above the grass that's what they were looking at all these shows like this dome\nAll black for they were watching this thing moving through the grass in spurts similar to like a spider wanted most quickly and stops moved quickly and stops\nFinally they catch this thing coursing and opening between two patches and it's heading towards the hogs that they were looking at which we're still far away\nWhen this thing came into the opening he said it looked like a ten or twelve foot long spider on four legs with the head sticking up what they saw was the head\nIt's scurried into the bushes or the or the grass on the other side making its way towards the hogs and as they were watching this thing it ... joined up and women stood up they knew it was a big for it and\nThis thing made a lunging leap like\nSuperman dive on to one of the ... some type of quick moving on and on the ground and left the field with the hog under it's\nAll on a bizarre story William we're gonna come back and take promise phone calls next on the coast to coast\nOne of the perks of being a ... or is that you can participate in our twenties monthly Lyme chances used or read the transcripts leader your jewelry chance with insiders and the second do the the month this visual used as a leader in the months\nAnd last time we talk to you told us about China's plans to build huge solar farms which could spike silver demand we also talked about California being the first state to require new homes to have solar are there other states\nMany are in the process but the latest trend is community solar what's so that that's\nWhere cities install solar panels and homeowners share the power Minnesota's doing this and if it's successful the program could Sikh community solar expand nationwide even globally\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly that's why some experts are calling for one hundred dollar silver and according to the world silver survey demand is already exceeding supply it's starting to get exciting\nKevin our listeners are passionate do you have anything you can send them so they can learn more\nWe do George we're going to make a special offer it's our latest sky high silver report the report is a twenty dollar value but your listeners get it free just call one eight hundred to nine nine Seventy four

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nHey I'm welcome back our final segment with William machine and we're going to take the calls but William before we take calls where do we get the book big foot terror in the woods\nUh the book uh there's actually four volume fifth on just came out a there are available on Amazon and pay them back and and\nSo you know you can have your druthers whether you're a a Kindle user or if you're like oh a paperback book which I kind of food for myself I like to feel the pages and\nTouched the old school but nothing wrong with that yup yup\nLet's go to Chicago Robert's with us to get things started hey Robert go ahead sir\nThank you George structure you hear me okay on you know we can\nThank you William two questions first of all have you ever seen a photo of a tool or make sure that were captured or killed in Pennsylvania in round two Seventy Michael this is thing really looks like the real McCoy\nThis was in Pennsylvania now in a circle Eighteen Seventy they're all in this one big shut up and the other big towards a Romanian\nAnd the second question I mean as you mentioned that you knew some men that shot\nA big foot what happened after the ... was shot why would you go down like they should have what kind of weapons are they out well\nHere's an answer your first question no a month a mill you with the uh two big foot in Pennsylvania\nUh but I have a number of historical accounts one of them was quite an interesting uh that came from a photograph taken from a a grandparents' house after the ... final grandparents had died\nIn which was depicted a work camp in Virginia at the time uh that was set up a after Roosevelt pet established a uh the protection of the parks\nAre they they needed to start making ... an access to these parks and structures so people could go in there and stay in a bathroom facilities and rangers stations so they had assembled this civilian core of workers\nAnd these guys were in there basically roughing it in the wilderness in these newly protected uh a wooded areas that were to become a national parks and they will regularly having encounters with what they called the hairy men\nAre in fact in the one in ... account in a one of my books called the hairy men one of these things came into the camp and tried dragging wanted the men off of this caught any all the men at tactic throwing a handout taxes\nAnd grabbing guns shooting at to thing has it ran\nA out of their uh encampment now the the odd thing is about these things\n[noise] it seems that shocked on fire has almost no effect on them are in fact in one account called the pheasant hunters this guy hit this thing at twenty twenty five yards with both bottles of a seven and a half lead shot\nAnd he said the thing didn't even flinch and kept running through a briar patch\nOr in answer to your second question about a big puts being shot or in my account called the fifth bullet this guy was hunting in um I think was Idaho\nAt any rate he came to an area or in the woods where he was confronted with a mountains in ridge line on three sides in front of him and he ran across what he described as a quantitative cut\nSticks he said this thing did not randomly form there in fact there was nothing about this pine forests lent itself\nTo having this quantity of sticks and branch bows or bows and branches formed in this type of thing and the inside had about a two foot deep layer\nOf branches as well as well for me what he thought was like betting so his initial thought was that hunters had built this thing as like a shelter when they were out there but that was soon change\nOn this ridge line that he had initially seen coming into the place he was now seeing a dark figure standing at the ridge which started to charge in his direction down the hill\nNow he estimated that this ridge line was about a Fifteen hundred feet\nAbove the valley that he was standing in and he said that the rate that this thing was running down the hill was impossible for a man to do when this thing broke to the base of the ridge\nHe estimated now that it was about six to nine hundred yards away from his position and at the time he was a hunting with a vintage Korean War vintage am one car being\nAs it got closer he leveled the fight on it and pumped around over its head\nThinking it would scare it it kept running he described this thing as looking like the cop in the Terminator movies when that that ah cyborg or whatever the heck they called the Terminator robot was are posing as the police officer\nAnd how he was running relentlessly with the arms pumping and like nothing could stop them\nEven load is gone fired a second round dad he sure he hated it had no effect on them and they kept running\nHe fired off third and fourth round and this thing kept coming at him now was closing in he's squeeze the trigger on the fifth bullet which is why and then destroys the bullet and it finally drop\nAnd when he walked up on it he got closer we shot it with another round\nHe got even closer to and he realized the thing was was not moving in that it was gone\nAnd he left it where it was now here's the thing George\nFirst of all this guy shoot this thing in self defense he's in imminent danger or this things coming at him like about the hell he shooting at this thing and the bullet seem to be having having no effect on them\nAnd yet when he's short lying on the ground he conceded that had been wanting to do was multiple blood patches where these bullets had actually hit it\nBut why these things can go now we all know if you go hunting\nIf you don't hit a moose ... or email or deer if you don't get a good long shot or hard shot some type of solid organs shot\nThese things can run and hunters to lose their a quarry not being able to find it because they can go for miles or you know they could just disappear on you if you don't get a good shot\nBut these creatures it seems like to me if you are going to take one of these things down it's gotta be a head shot it's got to be in the neck or the ... and\nSomething much sadly then you have to take them now well I mean what are you going to do George rhino

another a definition of the word foo fighters and it's the it's some unidentified flying objects that a military personnel see while they're in the air\nI did not know and they call them foo fighters and I didn't realize that that's where the name came from but um it it's they've used that term sense I think World War two and tonight we're going to talk about that specifically plus a whole bunch of things as it relates to\nEat cheese UFOs extraterrestrial armed forces um encountering in combating first armed forces where the U.S military or the military even other country these things are happening far more frequently\nAnd far more commonly than we've been told and Frank Joseph has written a book about it and those were going to talk about the this is why we need the space for us we do need to pay for that will be there was a start starship troopers was that one with\nThe whole you know that was just as bad when you saw the second one was horrible yeah first one was that okay that's

missed the eighties slip through the slums oh you didn't do a lot of them [laughter] anyway let's bring break into the program he framed welcome to be unreal radio pleasure to have you on the show today\nThank you the pleasures on line ... been looking forward to your book is called military encounters with extraterrestrials that says a lot just in the title what's going on here\n[noise] [noise] well there are thousands of books on UFOs you probably know um but so far as I'm aware there has been no book that has really made it comprehensive study of the military records\nThat a document in a magnificent way or the encounters between what I can only refer to as off world vehicles manned by intelligence is that er and out of this earth\nAnd the military forces of various countries around the world and what is remarkable about this book and I couldn't even begin it this way it just sort of evolve this way\nIs that a rather than just you know a couple of farmers in the field saying that they saw some your phone and come down some green little guy note there ... or something like that you know [noise] um instead what we have here are the testimonies of truly professional\nTrained observers\nAnd the thing about it is is that if you witness anything and you're in the military I don't care what services even what country it is if you observe something and you make a report about it\nYou are under law obligated to tell exactly what happened to the best of your ability and if you don't if you say fudge that will send you to Leavenworth sat serious\nAnd either you when you see something that's out of this world like I'm some a disc or something that's happening combat with you or with or whatever your\nComrades and you you chose not to report it I didn't see it at the same thing in the police department sometimes police departments of police officers will see things they know are not altogether ah reflect very well necessarily on their bosses and\nThey will say I didn't see it or or maybe they will say that they did see it and they're known as a whistle blower and so we have in military encounters with extraterrestrials or military whistle blowers these are very brave men and women mostly men\nThat I'm a sauce things that we're not in the book and they had the guts to report it and\nSo what you amount what is it a moment to here is that every ... every incident reported in this book is documented I mean I can go to the back of the book and see it's quite a large\nA ... a source reference bibliography it was not a ... really it's more military records are that are available to the public mostly a ... a mostly available that are\nA declassified but not much discussed\nAnd so you have in in Togo in some some of the most convincing and beautifully documented testimony of the show that this you off\nAnd that is actually has been going on for decades it's not theory and it's not just hearsay a these are professional uh witnesses to something quite extraordinary\nLet me ask the military want you to report it and they want you to report it hundred percent of the way the way you know and everything but then you have the situation with aviation pilot when if they admit something receive something a lot of times bill\n... job store to get those on the line absolutely\nThat has happened and especially with a civilian pilots there was a Japanese airline pilot for a jail pilot who had very excellently documented encountered and not only with himself but with radar operators on the ground and he had\nA a fortitude to tell exactly what happened and he lost his job that's quite common I I don't deal with that in the book I tried to stick to the military sources as much as I possibly can\nAnd it's to the crowded especially of the U.S air force and the U.S navy that as recently as just last year last December not even a year ago\nThat some of this material is being declassified now and they're allowing some of their uh pilots to come out and say what happened and they are even providing some of the videos or so there is a slow disclosure that is is going on right now it's just remarkable they're not quite as\nTight fisted on these things as they used to be so we're in an era I think the transition where there is going to I think that there is going to be full disclosure ah but the navy and the air force of may pioneering efforts in this direction I think they feel\nThat it's best to go about this in a rather slow methodical way rather than just spring it all on us at one time\nWhen you think that the U.S military would deal with the plane companies out there do American news companies want anything that they are planning because those planes around me are much more abundant than any military out there who you think that they would\nThey would actually want pilots who tell when something we've seen so they could document that they could get information on it would you think\nWell not really because of civilian um uh owners of the major airlines\nOr they want people to feel they're flying the friendly skies and they want to know that there is total safety in total control involved and or something as controversial as you know look out your window and there is a a vehicle that's maybe three or four times larger than you're on the aircraft that you're flying and\nIt can be a little bit disturbing so it's best if I think from a\nBusiness point of view that at least they feel that that's not to be disclosed but the military though I think is the head of that and certainly in the army as had believe it or not the army has had almost as many\nA documented sightings as the air force has but the army has been very very closed on that for the most part but the air force and especially in the navy or haven't been releasing material and I include some of that in the book is really fabulous stuff\nWho ... who had been occurring\nWell the sightings have been going on as long as mankind has been around\n'em but the great shift that has taken place and as far as I Know my book is the only one that has really um noticed this although I have to take my hat off to Stanton Friedman who certainly has made some pioneering efforts in this direction but from what I can tell from what I Am able to understand\nUm there has been no really a negative or bad confrontations harmful confrontations between humanity anywhere\nIs from some elsewhere are there have been many sightings I'm going back all the way back to ancient times I even include a couple of those in the introduction but the big change happened\nIn World War one because in World War one was the first time that human beings we're able to do two things they were able to fly heavier than aircraft and they were able to put heavy explosives on board those craft\nNow you're dealing with a society that has maybe been around for much longer than ours has maybe thousands many many thousands of years and who have the ability to\nGo from one galaxy to another is astounding as that might be not just from one planet to another but to transcend the galaxies witches appears what they're able to do\nThen they've seen probably many planets like ours many civilization was like our own\nAnd they it is not hard for them to extrapolate from the beginning of a society a civilization that can have heavier than aircraft with heavy explosives on board\nDo what they are only a few generations they'll be in space and that's exactly what has happened between Nineteen fourteen and the present time little more than a hundred years\nWe've gone from the ... from the beginning of the Wright brothers and shortly thereafter with bombers by plane bombers going less a hundred miles an hour flying over a few hundred miles to now we have announced the creation of the United states space for ...\nI think what really troubled second only to do from the U.S but really troubles these extraterrestrial intelligence says is that now this species ourselves we have now the ability to put\nCraft weapons atomic weapons nuclear weapons into space and I think that that is very worrisome for them and that is what accounts for the sometimes violent and life taking skirmish shows that have taken place we have actually been in an undeclared war\nWith another another species and intelligence species for more than a hundred years actually began to Nineteen sixteen\nAnd uh the documentation for that I think is laid out pretty clearly it's been a war that we have a one some of the battles but we've lost most of them\nAnd where it will go I Do not hold a but I'm the purpose of my book was to chronicle and to document this silent war or the ... undeclared war that has been taking place in is going on at this very moment\nPenetrate a end of the solar system and beyond so that\nThat is a scary prospect quite honestly\nYou know maybe we're a mouse about do you fear that it was dressed real extraterrestrial cats that we're going to pounce on\nYou know no I don't speak to us now not saying anything in the book that hasn't already been said which is interesting it just hasn't been put together as a goal they did\nA I was kind of surprised when I I guess anybody can do is I went on to the U.S navy a website which is often the public\nAnd uh I when I searched their archives which are also available to the public nobody's stopping and I and I found other huge blunders material about all these encounters with that the navy has had with UFOs going way back to World War one\nAnd not World War two for one I thought my God so I think what happened was that ... I'm just guessing that some high official in the navy I just said oh well we got all our records will just without even realizing what he had put them all out there for the public\nTo see and boy you can mine some pretty shocking that I don't think they even realized uh some of the higher ups in the navy exactly some of the terrific material that's out there so I I put that in the book and it's not against the law so I wasn't afraid of ...\nOf my fellow kind a my fellow human beings\nBut when I felt like I say I felt like amounts to be pounced on I think that's I'm thinking about us as a humanity as a whole\nAnd I don't think that the the eighties or you want to put it this way a care whether we blow ourselves to bed or not this or not but there are concerned that we started a waving around as nuclear weapons\nIn space that I think it's a little disturbing to them\nAs you were on tour ... information and things like the website ... mission did you go to ... ... you\nKnow I didn't because uh I I found really all I needed right there and uh\nThey want to release this information or not I have no control over that and\nI really ... uh my job I felt was not to get too in depth on that why what they felt about it and so I'm not be very interesting I suppose I just wanted to write a comprehensive history I didn't want to linger too long on any one thing but I wanted to provide the reader with a basic\nBut a pretty thoroughly history of all the shooting that has taken place all of the the violent encounter is that suddenly began in Nineteen sixty nine continue to this day there have been deaths on both sides\nAnd um losses of ships and\nPlanes and material\nAnd um mostly it's it's certainly under reported in some cases it's been pretty much unreported but the sources are there I just but that's my job as a journalist is to hook up these sources\nAnd then to provide them so that the reader can see that this is something that's really took place at this as a dock I document every single incident that's reported without exception uh his foot noted and I have source materials for everything so it's not something that\nI just made up I heard somebody say\nOh this is the actual ... mostly military uh sources or a substantial news a new sources you know like a New York times for example and or whatever that's worth and\nOh you know the times in London and things like that some pretty good sources that I've tried to provide for these are accounts\n... you're saying that the constitution was back in\nJuly nineteenth sixteen\nUm that's when\nSomething like about if I remember correctly about Seventeen Seventeen different munitions plants across the United states mostly between the eastern seaboard and the Mississippi River were blown up and I tell you about blown up they were destroyed\nAnd that these were mostly owned by the ... the dupont companies this is a piece of information that I got only from a a British source\nPut me on to the other sources for this I don't believe it's really been published in the United states which is kind of remarkable because these incidents took place in the United states and these munitions plants that were being blown up were being destroyed\nAlmost invariably associated with terrific sightings of what people in those days referred to as flying hats or silent airplanes Errol planes as they call them back then\nUm and these sightings were made either ... just prior to these enormous explosions that\nTook place or immediately thereafter sometimes they were described as\nA metallic Mexican hats and could this is the days long before UFOs signings or before anybody even considered or thought about such things there was one munitions plants\nAnd that was blown up it was called the big time planting New Jersey and when that place went up it registered at the same blasted the same effect as a five point five\nEarthquake on the Richter scale\nAnd as far as I can tell nobody was killed in any of these blast remarkably few people were injured a about a it was a course blamed on German espionage agents well it's kind of a remarkable because\nAt that time Nineteen sixteen this is just the year before the United states went to war against the imperial Germany\nKaiser ... was doing everything conceivable to keep the United states out of World War one quite obviously and not be at his hands filled trying to beat virus Russia France and England he did not want the United states do anything to antagonize the America\nSo he had no agents over here and ... and he would have been totally disavowed anybody that would have been blown up a munitions plant\nSo during World War one that was put out by the federal government that these were German agents going around blowing up these munitions plants than after World War World War one as recently after the war is Nineteen twenty\nThe same federal government came out with ... an extensive report saying there was absolutely no evidence that any German\nEspionage agents were any ... enemy aircraft which in those days be preposterous were flying over these plans and bombing them and the cause of all these uh Seventeen are so munitions plants blowing up is unknown\nSo and it was just about that same time very shortly thereafter\nThat this wonderful a documentation of these before I'm a U.S soldiers there the first interesting is the first you a full report is from uh the U. S. army these army soldiers were guarding a bridge\nOr at the Massachusetts I'm a naval yards when they were um men asked by a craft that made absolutely no noise at all it was in the middle of the nice about two o'clock in the morning\nThey were guarding this bridge this craft this looming his craft\nA scoop down of the sky came at them very closely like was diving on the bridge they opened fire on it or they claimed to have hit it\nAnd that that ... an incredible speed and they thought that it was a some kind of a German or aircraft of psychiatrists at the term is still planes capable of but nobody any aircraft capable of performing like that and certainly\nGermans had no aircraft to spare for\nAh going over to Massachusetts in Nineteen Seventeen which when that took place\nAnd a ... incident was also a accompanied by numerous sightings a before and after all these Mexican hat says they refer to them and they know how to describe it that made no noise and had no lights on them except at nighttime they seemed luminous including ... speeds\nAnd made a maneuvers that even today would be impossible show this these were the opening shots\nOf a a a a ... a World War a war between worlds and I believe that the destruction all these\nUm dupont munitions plan C. Seventeen munitions plants in Nineteen sixteen\nWasn't effort on the part of these\nExtraterrestrials to inhibit os and also I think ah\nTo send a message to us that this would not be tolerated if you wanted to blow up your your own people with a with artillery and so on that's perfectly fine but we don't like the idea of you know being able to get off the earth and bring your your heavy\nWeapons uh above the earth because we see where this is leading where it's going to you\nKnow I'm sure that would that would I was the beginning of it I'm sure they would start serious here are just rank your book between rural ... were were brutal", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "03"}
