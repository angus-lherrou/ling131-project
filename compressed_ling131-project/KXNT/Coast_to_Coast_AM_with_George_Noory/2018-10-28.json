the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific which didn't like Halloween show but a lot to talk with the GW Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch\nAnd it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their

think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this ... this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a\nA writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight in Los Angeles we're not competing again he\nExtended the Dodgers ended up playing last night uh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but uh but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nBetween you know the creator and the creation and in fact in the very first\nVersion of a robot before the asthma version of a robot um the robot that has created in the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties or sits down and read Frankenstein\nAnd then has a better understanding of life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot com to a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun about\nEight or a cover up\nThat may have been exposed Google Earth blind spots over the experimental military base\nMaybe where US government hides crushed UFOs that according to a defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada um and what they had recently uncovered but but if they did\nWell then you know they would it would become the new Roswell\nI'm kinda happy with the old role as well and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nCan evening so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel in and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this is the time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans were for Halloween what do you do if if\nIf Ross was kind of Halloween all your lungs in a way for some people with the discussion of aliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to grade farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about\nSeven miles out of town where they participate in the coordinates\nOr the great family at\nThe coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on a UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they can get every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people that go out and really try to experience aren't that hard that\nFeeling of getting off the NFL life and you're a\nCrash in Nineteen forty seven other people go out here in my state park ah which again has and history at the bottom last and and it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful lake great place to argue camp and things like that but again I'm\nMore more of the stars and the telescope can people get dressed up and they feel that they become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that theory if there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with them especially around\nHalloween and during the UFO festival in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through Roswell on my way to\nA new position will be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roswell right so we we we\nIs this will be teaching you to Kansas State it my my ... my younger son and I always wanted to go to ... so we we we mapped out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to give you a hunter Roswell before we come back up again\nAnd it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there anybody we're interested in being able to go to the crash site\nUm or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of the crushing Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international year from him and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm\nDefinitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe a in addition to that we have a U.S a tour of that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and you're a first for over twenty plus years and he will take you to the exact location\nOf the timing of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the bulk or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a Mac Brazil's rent a house is still\nKind of in in place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land and so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend that people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nUh we you know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nAt the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great store I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have two amazing aliens decorate a for each holiday especially now for Halloween\nPuts on a big fall festival with our police officers and things like that for the community but um these they're about six foot aliens and people love to take pictures with them and\nYou'll hear the story of you know our employee of the month his name is Bob and ... and uh you know people really come here searching for the truth\nWe as local we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and do the research\nWell that'd be great thank you and we should let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the U.S food and\nUm so our population has doubled in size we're we're account about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we see a little over two hundred and thirty thousand visitors\nThat on the UFO museum and Research Center\nOn good really good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts\nPretty good\nPretty good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you Juanita and if I'm if I'm driving through town and get a chance I'll say hello okay yes prepare where\nThe ... to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism or public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a J W let me just tell you very funny book you read his great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic sides on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to this ... this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[noise] yeah that's about right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month and a quarter million so the massive amount of people for the small city to have a set of orders\nWell I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not it's not a narrow subject but you picked Halloween insane that subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications\nOf the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago about on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example I didn't realize that ... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem\nThat had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that felt wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest one of the strangest for them you know there are [noise] you know the first for trout America you're a victim was in Connecticut\nAnd Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of course yes injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt is the honestly it's really a problem today even in ... and I'm also developed countries are still being people are being asked you for being with us but the the strange thing about that to me of course all of the planet that have had this problem which is pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and I feel in Massachusetts\nSomething amazing happened which already taste while I was actually a contract almost staggering about this what they think that you can check it out on top of the kind of weight that might result started coming for like a kinda barbaric ... hot excuse the pun well I\nI think that works beautifully on a Richard astro here we're talking about the power of waking up your immune system which has hailed this gentleman's hot perhaps the immune system can be called one of the bodies fears this powers to he'll visit\nC. A. R. N. I. V. O. R. A. dot com or call one eight\nSix six eight three six eight seven three five that's one eight six six eight three six eight seven three five\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nSo the J W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look at some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven viral do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt link usher England\nA long ago turned its tend to which is incident in which ten people were hanged in sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden there's a witch memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nDraw in Sweden there's which memorial to the more than Seventy victims who were be headed in burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused\nAnd that's just some of them and not even all that happened in America but its Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that for the big questions that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors obviously that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\n[laughter] oh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nThen it's kind of a you know it's a moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually for you you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy real killer tree famous worlds exposition right you don't know did he do go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right through and I think to sort of that one is that\nYou know the tragedy in Salem itself was basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trial right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations are around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door in what's now Denver's was at the time of failing village\nFor sale itself doesn't really have a kind of kind of a generational connection to it it was just the sight of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim of a witch trials I mean the actual which is that live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since since I was kind of become Halloween count as well so at the terminal which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today and twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess and this is important in this ... this great distinction can't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder [laughter] they were executed\nAnd they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah and that is a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that Salem is kind of ruffled with for you know probably ... century that a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy that's kind of underneath the underneath or Fort Ord so to speak and part of it that's left connected to the tragedy with more just around\nYou know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they\nCelebrate Halloween day I mean they celebrate a season basically for that\nAbsolute pandemonium [laughter] it really is so they they don't celebrate Halloween day\nI mean they celebrate a season basically so that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really has bled over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit found the Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowds it's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of Salem itself\nIt's Mardi Gras beads\nIt is it really is um you're talking again hundred thousand people packed to the small down time of the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes a freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars washed the fireworks all kinds of stuff\nSo you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras is a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans Mardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get in Mardi Gras in any way but there's probably some amount of alcohol than consumed during this celebration\nOh definitely actually right now we're in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts\nThe families of them right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween booze is a part of it but this is within the party\n[noise] okay so ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean it's the little known for being hunted either ... or there were a lot of haunted houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims you have monsters cause of the film was trial then just involved which is in the story involves\nDemons and m's than shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass so you have all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or up three hundred and Thirty years of history so that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries\nSo yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in Salem um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other side of the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky pathology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time out there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the ... and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more in the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest as more just in the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nLet's let's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the ones that really creepy ones is one of the Boston trailer victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual store called event that then I can reverse\nThe ones that one of the Boston strain that victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual store or vent but then I can reverberate and have kind of all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jails there\nSo all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know macabre kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials all that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of of the ... around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was there somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm curious do was there an attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\nNo no he was ... or the building actually still stands it's it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there there was real police that station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know scape\nAs PR move for his next big event so now he wasn't down there do in order to stay on the busing but you're doing is a is a scape escape routine\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into the\nFor you Dr ... to be okay to do this all over

wanted to pass along with all sincerity I I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nUh whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler the wages of\nOr the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking tonight the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow\nYoung men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies are unforgiving it's a hell of a thing killed demand take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have\nOh well yeah ... and and I will tell you though it it did present a small problem regarding\nOur interview tonight because I had started to read the book and then I was told but if the red Sox make the series he can't be on with us\nSo I had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the Bo Sox made it into the series I I packed the book\nIn my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving to K state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of the two of them on so I Move into Manhattan meant to be ... will be like almost neighbors and yet\nI wind up in Manhattan I Am very well and they\nGo oh totally cool so that so I packed\nThe book and then I got the call like four days later on always good to go like uh the book is the head of the overnight me a book so I had it in my hand but unfortunately loves them and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading\nEspecially because I can tell already you're building up\nTo a climax that I Do not want to miss with this true story of the the uh the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your co author is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nCarter my daughter ... daughter my daughter she uh she worked with me on a book\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption\nOr my daughter she she's a she worked with me on the book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a ticket that out and then ... say that when I worked\nOut well I'd probably did somewhere but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say a great book obviously deserves all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case\nUm is very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the\n... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would have had to cancel out of it I Would have been torture to keep all we have to be going well over here on earth\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] oh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the Boston Straggler along with hundreds of other ... in a book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or I Would I did um\nA a I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took an emphasis in the box and stronger case and publish some theories about it which may be right or wrong who knows\n[laughter] well I Love that I ... I may revisited that 'cause I'm always been very interested in as well but demands on the train is a story it is it just speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and rule do the cleanup true crime and I asked her once I said is is there any story\nToo old to be told\nOr when it comes to you know re telling a story about a\nMurder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one\nThat either been incorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also it's true for all the time that that will be of there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody has connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a ... a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now with these totally innocent\nThey write their their trip while they're there for people who were extra lovely executed for crimes that may have been convicted by the man trying to them I Would go so far as to say I'm fairly certain the crime was committed by the man from the train but\nA local person was executed and I'm Alive\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure they uh uh but there there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob who when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by right from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight the last that we are pretty sure that was him writing well although there was a there was an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say to him\nSo I looked in the ocean\nThere's an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that it can\nSay I looked in the I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois it sucked the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house\nI'm ... and ... the mayor\nIn around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nOf was murdered along with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved and they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into the sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always that it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them\nUm but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\nThe it it is possible we haven't we assume\nThat we did not find every crime that he committed we just we found those uh which there were enough signature\nA sick statement or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're there for him but they they may well committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my parents' scratching at writing down\n[laughter] I wouldn't have to murder a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody but it made me think about it and so if I got something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a a a poke anyway\nSo how many people do we think were murdered along America's railroad tracks by a single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and bucket right there's a hundred percent ... that that is crimes were certain okay I'm a Seventy percent ... percent bucket and I've kind of ... percent bucket right and I'm ... total up the numbers of murders and each pocket and multiplied them by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder the total we came up with a hundred and one that actually include the two people who were murderer were executed by the state\nA lot for crimes they committed and read the uh somewhere between four and nine people who were who were murdered by a Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or it may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions as murders because they were innocent I'm Julie said somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims risk guy\nOkay that's right All right so ... gets through a a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's M. O.\nPhilip being in the late ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long this could be a long after I'm not a long way the person booth could be a long answer because there are a lot of things that ... them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happened within an hour at midnight\nA family is murder most off from a family including how young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies\nLive usually in a small ... at a pound too small to have a police department [noise]\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad track\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with Iraq the ax is found in the in the yard of the victims are in the yard of a neighbor and the actually the ban then at the same as a crime or handle is washed her finger prime\nThe house is locked up tight to all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law the or or\nThis killer or the one from this morning but just because there's a lot of doubles and running around these days including ... getting a big win a fun job show the we were just a hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I had to cut you off because we have the heartbreaking ... really it was\nGraduate or after they because I was going to run out of the things to say but I was able to find\nThe heart of type ... like a little bit but yeah ... ... what's that like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they um they ah the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night for you to hurt on the weekends up until Nineteen ten the crimes almost all occurred in areas in which the primary industry was ballgame or one of the primary industries was logging\nThe or doors doors and windows ... shot I think I mentioned that they um [noise] there's all there are clear geographic patterns and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them back to curse just north of Portland\nOr so that that would be a link between them they uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take a lap from inside the house turn the wick way down low so that you just gave out a little bit of light take the chairman a off the lamp and set it on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed murders\nThe other thing is that he would put poet blankets over the head of a sleeping person or a half a second before you had with an axe or you did that a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from flying back and hitting hitting him as he was\nPerjuring someone there are quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along\nLogging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the town that I grew up in his logging town but he was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nA new era that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed them poet or another\nThing I've got mentioned ... all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he that he may have ... whether it's first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not\nNot a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\nUm we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something\nMy with my publisher which I knew I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murderer in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing on it secret there because it is done in in secret the facts about it are never\nFully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting titled than this this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\nYou know any it fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they ... they couldn't have done these things\nUsing drifters or people in the hope much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims rights were John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demand from the train is is he is he's called ... and we have to call them that although we'll get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the climate ... leader on almost don't want to because they don't want to ruin them so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but then there's a couple of good football games to strengthen dinner\nSo the ... but this guy he nobody in the president does him for us to just assume that there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a home near train tracks\nNow because there's a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out which is\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWell from Eighteen Ninety eight nine ten eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight the wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nInformation of this type have little ability to spread from town to town\nBy Nineteen twelve the national wire services were were organized a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when they went to his most famous crime below Scott Iowa in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first more than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even wham\nLogically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes and there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the er er and and towns that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies\nAnd you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that I mean we're in the United states and all the rest of the year\nYou would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't\nAnd there is no other crime like that I mean we're in the United states in all the rest of the year\nYou would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the insurgency of\nThe jurisdiction of sharing of police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national an investigative a body of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces is also what are the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time I'm [laughter]\nI thought I was probably knowledgeable about it I was astonished to to realize how backward and ineffective our judicial system was just a hundred years ago ... it's beyond belief how\nPrimitive the investigative\nProcess that's war at the time of the crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the curia weaknesses of the of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture they ah they knew that if he committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered that was you know no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first\nOf all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they ... they had no resources to come after him\nAnd and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean the the ... yeah and this was a ... and then ... I'll even throw in another ... ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn 'em ... is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science [noise]\nUm yeah and I ... I wrote about this little bit in in a in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nLike telling them this is who do it's it's not science\nGet all the health care they need making a person's house adaptable for them to go back home and live\nEducation benefits and less focus on getting them a job and if something happens to the veterans and you know where the spouses advocate\nWe help our veterans for three the way that paralyzed veterans of America does that is their national service not sitting down located throughout the United states\nWork is important because people depend on us and they know when\nThey come to paralyze residence America they going to get the right answer and they know that we're there for them twenty four seven [noise] because we are\nChanging knives building futures that's paralyzed veterans of America to learn more missed a PBA dot org [noise] a public service message from paralyzed veterans of America\nFrom the justice of heart ... studios infant G.

Iowa I'm and do the crime story which\nAs you pointed out earlier is the one that starts to to give away um ... the communities are already catching on at this point to the fact that there is a killer on the real way tickets tickets through what happened in ...\nOn on the night of a gym nine Nineteen twelve oh the lights were out in Alaska due to a um a dispute between the police cars city council and the power company so\nThey had city lights and street lights but they were out of his and the town was in complete darkness as this Sunday night there was a church service\nOr a Sunday night church service organized by one of the victims but I've ... the woman who was the head of the house after the ...\nAfter the ... I didn't get into this in the book\nBut I think it's true I don't believe in divorce can murders would ... would ever have happened when they did had the light spin on and the reason that was true is that he had committed another atrocity of just six days earlier about a hundred miles away\nAnd he normally would not have\nA had another outraged that quickly but because the lights the city was plunged into darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it up anyway ... um\nUh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service and and uh the little girls spent the night with the their friend the little girl was a member of the family\nOn the morning of June can no one is starting around in the house the a and the uh uh\nHis brother finally comes to break into the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the town marshal\nAnd he his name as as a tank court and Mr Horton courageously goes through the house\nYou have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that uh a craze murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here as a dark house or he's holding matches in front of him\nOr with no gun to no form of protection holding matches in front of a front of his other themselves going from room to room finding bodies their eight dead bodies in the house and like if my log house in a small quiet mid western town the um [noise]\nUh and all of them have had with an axe\nMy log house in a small quiet\nWestern town the um [noise] uh and all of them have had with an axe the access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl\nThe man from the train was a it was a pervert than he was interested in little little girls and the the little girl was usually found in a\nIn an added to suggesting that she had been a she had been outraged after that they um [noise] uh\nIn any case the crime was not there was a a great uproar is you can imagine but the crime was not solved\nA two years later a con man named Jay and walk or some came to Alaska\nAnd realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry he can keep donations coming in by keeping people angry or ... and he did that by using a a very prominent local set of them Frank Jones of finance or the crimes\nThere isn't any chance of the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he had in any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute Frank drones divided bulldoze a in a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did or didn't do it\nFor several years uh and became\nA K better badly divided community we have families on one side of the line wouldn't play with families on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop if their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them that this battle lasted in Alaska for even though\nA walk or something with eventually run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time and the hard feelings emanating from it persisted in the city I Would I Would say for two extent that they persisted the President's Day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the the person whipping up sentiment in making a false accusations of profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern for all too often how\nUm crime stories unsolved crime stories are treated yet yeah it's the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case\nPolice officers working the the crime still the crimes have been at that time might have been solved by after that period of time by somebody reading a letter confessing or somebody knowing somebody but\nBut it wasn't it went to almost literally like fall in their lap which again comes back to the the power of storytelling\nAnd how he just by keeping my telling a story to beginning middle and end all of these events it doesn't matter how old the story is is that it will get people to listen again in to reconsider again and most likely to connect again\nTo that sense of outrage about what had happened\nAnd so you know a static police report won't necessarily\nYou know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right and and and they do that but also teach to the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it that is you know the core sensationalism but it does it make it shouldn't make you feel it\nIt it makes it it gives you a sensation again it it it that is you know the core sensationalism but it does it make it make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened\n... had they had they built it you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been any had there been what had the town done to try\nTo come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this con men coming to town or afterwards\nThe um [noise] uh ... well there was I don't know that there was that type of sound about I don't know that anyone built a memorial to them I I'm for many years the bullets or\nAuthority that I Would say that still true today that ... the the chamber of commerce tribes pipes and let's go wish the bullets go was known for something else right right they are ... there is a house for the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of of more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe um [noise] a lot if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but ah where the ... what ... is known for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial right yeah uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a\nProper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people most when people without\nA without one and the the more family was very well like they are and the community uh thought well all of them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them or by that I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... there's an effort to try to say just enough to be like a statue\nBut it is interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned the economics peace not explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of it's done is not a you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps of trades crimes with the double murder and Colorado Springs I it murder two families in one night and joining out the ah ah but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah all that fat house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it just said that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so so it goes to run\n'em but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nOr you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the men from the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nA ... or ones that are very unlikely but the the shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders were going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of entire family and what a bad as it is a rare that that was them and it is now but uh uh there were very very unsolved murders in that era\nYou know I mean just even as you mentioned there just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long because there wasn't a lot of funding but so is ...\nWe're in any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long is it wasn't a lot of funding\nBut Joe ... let's let's let's go down this path of of the process that you use to try to actually\nYou've narrowed down to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example for us and including going through ships registries and signing whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders in white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ... and so they were able to trying to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port and in each one of these ports there was a murder\nSo it it it just it but you have to you also have to START I mean it it's not quite a needle in a haystack but it's it's at least maybe um you know to to look at it broadly you're\nYou're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing the search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that a name could even be found given the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries ... during that period\nYou mentioned the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read\nProbably twenty bucks saying jak river was this guy or whatever it was that guy or jak they are and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't I\nDon't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are silly they um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas and Rachel says that she did expect to find them but I didn't the um uh but when we walk the crimes backward\nA there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight that Rachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him the um uh and that was because I have told her that this guy wouldn't make mistakes and in his first crime he did make\nNumerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was\nThe uh uh but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would\nThat you would a suspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few things\nYeah please do you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nReally matter you know we will they'll let you go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes in the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him on top of this is the same guy maybe that crime a month ago down south for the\nThe uh uh that\nCriminal had size six feet the um ... there's another crime in Maine and Nineteen oh two in\nThe that criminal had size six feet the\nUm ... there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals there were there were a pair of boots prance that were central to the trial\nOr again size six feet this is very uh the the so we we know that this is a small man well it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet\nNot speculation he did\nWe know that we ... it was believed that he was small because I'm the or\nA ... and in other places when he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling\nIf a person of normal size a person of\nA if a person a large man could not swing an axe over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for\nThe uh uh\nIt was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you can see clearly rather it's the guys basically left handed or basically right hander that's a pretty easy thing to see\nIt was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed\nWe had said that he had to be a well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap than he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settled down into an area [noise] we had said that he must work as a longer because\nAll the crimes for about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him first stories about him specifically say that he was an experience blogger\nThe uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA ... girl a that was there in the first crime in the first cry he always killed the man of the house first and the a and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime\nThe he always used the blunt side of the X. oh you'd never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say you never killed anyone with a sharp ... but it was always his intention to use the blunt side of the acts in this first crime blunt side of the acts\nAnd as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the uh so the crime just matches up on too many points for you to think that this isn't him\n[noise] so then she started to look for science would bore left handed and filed Nick ... I didn't even longer ax murderer\nOr ...\n... well how did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nWhen he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who when he first crime is obvious who had committed it because he was living with the family which that's a common thing or a cereal murders first crime he often kills people to whom he is directly connected and\nCan be tied so we killed the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew\nHome and he is directly connected and can be tied so we killed the first family and Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who have done it because he fled the scene and I would say they were looking for is just that all of these other facts about the first about the criminal\nHappened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a ... ... the man on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using there was all Miller the weather that we watch it ... it was a German immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not um there's speculation he could have been using a false maybe even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found that I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found a the the ships record in which you entered the country about him Eighteen Ninety the ... are probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country\nI'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if\nIt was more like it in there and walk side to side\nWith the uh uh and the uh uh uh they they so if he had been in the German army a German Navy so ah they found that ship within which became what came into the okay\nSave your life is run by earned a nonprofit agency that help working families achieved posterity ... save her life will help you have any that can you feature\nYou'll receive weekly coaching emails reminders to save and you can earn up to sixty dollars in reward for saving your own money that's right you'll get paid to save [noise]\nIt's not too good to be true Jessica I save her life Klein says she's walking testimony that the program or\nThe program is real and you do have learned more I'd save her life dot org slash Nevada that save her life dot org slash Nevada so what are you waiting for this method sponsored by nonprofit earned aired in cooperation with the Nevada broadcasters association and the nation\nFrom the ... studios they intend ti am north Las Vegas game ...

with being punished [noise]\nSo grab a line here and join the conversation with Bill James I think we've covered a lot of things demand from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer how he did\nIt Ninety death um and yet as he says he's not even sure that they know all of the people that this man Paul Miller\nA could've killed starting an Eighteen Ninety eight until he was a while until he stopped um but what we have is we have a name and we have a description\nCurious to see whether that my jogging anybody else's memories of a local story in their community like you did with me earlier in the show we'll find out next uh coast to coast am this is Ian but it [noise]\nMy mom was in the OJ work as a matter but then there are some of the I think he\nHad the action is that he used the word they lumbering type of axes\n... uh mostly uh like an axe that was found in would pile\nAlmost all of the house I see murders\nWere ah were houses burned word um times\nCoal a buddy either water coal use an ax to split the wood or break up the cold right\nHe would he would use the coal actually the boy that would actually whatever you found outside the building\nWell see now that answers actually to my previous question about dropping the act's I wasn't so much thinking in terms of\nBigger print evidence I was thinking that could lead somebody to find out where he had purchased the acts but you're saying in every home he picked up the acts from the nearby would pile and use that so whenever a type of actually had it in the house when he left behind\nWhich is another point about Nineteen ten and writing and it was very common for people to have an act\nNo yeah wouldn't while outside their house oh yeah\nWe're is why I connect to the story I grew up in a small town in that I think the fifties and sixties ... at our house and I I chopped\nA lot of ... with them or to burn it out\nYeah my dad till ... similar story but then he and his brothers you know they would have to fight over who's going to be chopping wood and and when we were growing up we had an ax around the house [laughter] we we did a lot of woods jumping but for some reason my dad was attached to it All right so let me bring in about Paxton whose in Chicago\nAnd the first time caller line for Bill James author of\nDemand from the train very interesting Paxton\nFascinating\nJames author of the men from the train very interesting Paxton\nGuys fascinating I'm an English teacher and naturally I I lean pretty heavily I posed this time of year\nI I wanted to ask your guests ... feet if you noticed any ... any parallels between holds a vision you wrote about it and that says\nThat the murderer always has a guilty conscience and really tries to get caught and some of the more famous stories like the black cat well ironically berries and acts and his wife's head [laughter]\nRight that's the way he describes it and and when the Tom he he's not going to be caught so you know you will see at wall but the cat up in into the wall and uh you know he tried to get brought them into the basement and said look how followed the ...\nYou always try to give them so what\nThe uh uh by the way while doing research on the crime book\nI I happen to find a a story in a Paris newspaper in Eighteen forty six a which is apparently the original story from which the cast of ... or multi autos is base the a a poll also of course was it was a avid reader crime stories as as I'm sure you know\nThey are anyway the answer is no ... is he absolutely was not\nTrying to get caught in fact he many many many cereal murders are sort of playing games with the police and sometimes they want you to know who did it uh but they just don't want to because I don't want to be convicted of it but that's one thing that's quite unusual about this man is that he had a very unusual\nA aversion to being caught he didn't he wasn't he wasn't he absolutely was not trying to get caught and he was taking very intelligent\nAnd very well thought out you're basically of action not ever to be caught one reason he never took anything from a crime scene even the you know if there was a hundred dollars sitting on the shelf there\nYou wouldn't take it because he knew very well that if he was caught fleeing a crime scene inflating a scene with or something that could be\nTied to that scene you know a lot of people were executed for that the uh so no he was he was very nice to have a quite unusual extent yeah I had a an aversion to being caught\nThis is serious restraint right there I think we're a guy who didn't have any money the the uh the chosen disciplines um thank you mentioned was go to Marie who's in Athens, Georgia until she goes for Bill James ...\nHigh ... in in um well I was calling because I I was kinda curious person about how you got just now talking about the acts and um my my brother and I we were in fact again and murder happened it was after the civil war in our family um\nAnd he is my great however many that grandfather that was he was killed with an axe\nAnd then I think that his wife and maybe fan did that and ended up being a brother in law that was convicted and um he lives right out and I feel like I guess they have that same field workers would be blamed for bank anyway and so we were investigating that and then\nMy brother was murdered a year ago\nAnd then his son is in jail or killing the guy about two years again right now so if there's a lot of that around ... um\nAnd I was wondering you may you mentioned earlier about if a person you know I didn't I\nAround but um but I was wondering you ... you mentioned earlier about\nA person you know if they didn't make a lot of mistakes and the person that we believe that he'll my brother ... I'm going to be ... [laughter] well so far he's gotten away with it and so how do you find out I mean about a person if you um\nYou know where they're from but I'm just wondering if maybe he had done this before you know what I mean he was because every little detail he's saying who have known what you're going\nAnd then we can do to prepare for the first time\nOr a certain view for your emerged story Ruckel was ... New York and\nAh I Wish there was a bigger deal would be helpful through your but are are there really isn't\nI mean I I think as I said the Americans we were just very fortunate to a crime this treasure trove of information about the ... the first crime the er but I it's not something you can and we ... we could ritual and I were to sit out\nSo you know there are ... crimes like this\nWe wouldn't it wouldn't happen for ... because he wasn't something that happened because we were smarter because we knew were doing it just the way the crime set up where the story's set up the workforce\nUm religion to chew my uh in New York I'm poor James on Tuesday um\nYes good morning gentlemen and when the light to a a C. E. on your ah your\nBack in the satellites of were a good luck with\nThat Web looking forward to it but I have um a a two part question with some comment and I'll listen I'm over the uh well it's not the ad in New York it's it's over the\nInternet [laughter] the first part is now we have is that she would already stages at at hand\nAh people at the FBI or consider that profile is so I like to know\nIf you put this in a more modern contacts how a such a an FBI profile of Mike Mike slash this guy out\nMuch for the um also I like to hear more about and whether it's in the book in terms of somebody that innocence that got caught up including the black people who um [noise] wound up but not even going to trial but getting Lynch and the last part\nIs a ... you mentioned about the state of the police at this time at the turn of the century [noise] I didn't that saw the um [noise] ah I recently read a book by um\nNo ... it's called how the eye which became white this is on the Jacksonian Arab pre civil war and he actually described police besides the fact that you know they had to always looking for fugitive\nBlack folks but they off he described them as basically competing gangs are basically street gangs wouldn't volunteer fire department\nThat had competing fights and and demonstrations and I like in common that whether he's familiar with the gangs that came up as as a that formed in the police and I'll listen over over the Internet thank you so much\nYour for your most intelligent person you're I'm somewhat familiar with the ...\nThank you sound like what I hear where you're most intelligent questions\nYeah I'm somewhat familiar with the firehouse gangs are from New York and pretty civil war because they are I wrote about them in the book popular crime or they were in a it was a woman this gets back to pose ... there was a woman named Mary Rogers\nOr who was murdered in a New York and I want to say in\nEighteen forty five or thereabouts a poll oh fictionalized that the murder Murray road Jay but the actual woman's name was very Rogers the a and the uh\nThere was speculation that firehouse gangs were responsible for her crop for that\nCrime that they that it really is an odd thing that there were these fire houses that were really just just a\nA house with his family Joe's of pretty unruly people uh and they they were kind of ... in the city I so yeah I I Do that that's an odd story isn't it\n[noise]\nWe've got callers coast to coast leading to talk with Bill James gives a minute here's we wrap up the last question\nUm we talked about how there were intact gangs of fire departments and\nAnd I I think if anybody wants to know more about that too it's handy to go to ... you can watch the movie streets in New York right to ... ... ... there's a lot of them was during the news is kinda cool though she lifted the ... the question about what at Indiana modern police were FBI profile or take a look at this case\nI I haven't asked them do that because the that would not be in my nature I mean you know what this is my\nBook is written to say this is what I think and if you think something that's up to you I I but I wouldn't ask the up a John Douglass monitored a well known profile or has spoken and written about Alaska or one of his observations was that ah the\nUm well he had several observations about the ... the crime that lined up with what we believe for other reasons one was that the murder had to be older because he is extremely organized I mean he is on the chart of how organized is is burger this guy is\nUnbelievably organized or the or and and also he he um he said that Robert ... Kelly who was accused of murder is a really couldn't have done it a because his mind is very disorganized but also because\nHe was not physically strong enough um we know that the Paul Miller was physically extremely strong and extremely agile the um uh\nSo you got something there's something there but not a lot I mean I haven't I haven't asked profile or for his opinion I frankly wouldn't care what they have to say because you know they got their opinion I got my ... a lot of the book is about\nInnocence accused of the crimes that I'll tell you briefly just one of those stories and murder in Maine and night you know to a\nMan named Henry Lambert who was white obviously and that's that was accused of the crime\n[noise] he was just a a he was a a a knock around it was I got a an an educated illiterate French Canadian who uh who uh you know ... borderline homeless drank quite a bit\nHe was accused of the crime and was in prison for Twenty years or before a it became a cause for lab in Maine and a very good lawyer eventually work work trying to free him and did free and the governor of Maine eventually\nA graphic added a full pardon to him all that aren't based on a ... on actual innocence a buddy\nThat happened after he spent Twenty years in jail there are a lot of stories like that in this in the book it's it's quite it's a terrible side effects of what happened to\nThe New York police are are not relevant to this story because they were by Nineteen ten in the New York state police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated not relative to now but but relative to the places\nNineteen ten the New York city police were relatively organized relatively sophisticated not relative to know how but but relative to the places where these crimes occurred\nThese crimes occurred in places that didn't have a place to park they are they are they have like a city Marshall and that was it the or not it's not really that the are already that connected to my book\nNo fairness um money just to illustrate ... in that movie of how those gangs tied to operate within the government is the where everybody was vying for jobs even if that meant getting in like to keep them\nUm and and um and by the way I think ...\nOr would do indoors what you've done I think you might think you'd be a very proud of the way in which the what I Hope so it's a nice way to say no it really mean it did I don't think I think they would endorse it and I think they would find some interesting insights and there but this is the first time caller David is in Chicago on coast to coast am for Bill James Dave\nHow am I going to have to say\nI'm I'm Glad to hear you back on and cause the calls\nThank you miss yeah thank you\nUm I have a couple of comments first Mr james you're a large and I think and you you um didn't do your homework Bill James basically invented favor\nMaster for baseball\n[noise] so I have heard and uh yeah that that's his advisory capacity I Know ah I I had heard about that on Twitter but I I really I didn't want to get too deep into that but I'm Glad you feel for you to bring it up in in law him for that\nBut uh yeah I I I think he needs to be lauded for that I use out of their visor you pay to buy or just the Boston Red Sox now but he basically invested save all matters so his ...\nAnd I and what is trying to say about my this book is I think you're catalyst in the bottom of why I\nI'll forgive him for that because I Love you\nAnd what's the broader point you think I'm missing\n[noise] I think you're missing [noise] you know that you're talking to a legend\nOkay well if a bill if I haven't even having a ... appropriately treated you as the legend you are please accept my 'em up on the ...\nThe British are saying that that gave it's awfully nice of you the idea of a bar to go back and became but uh I my most of my career has been working in baseball and I appreciate your knowledge doing that and a first date you're kind of comic\nI understand that and I understand why you wouldn't want to make it connected to but I just think that needs to be sad that he has a large and All right thanks and his band baseball more enjoyable to me throughout my whole life they have your hamster or you know you know what I'm saying though\nAnyway the the reason I call them is silly thing at a time of year by you pointed out in Nineteen Ninety are Eighteen Ninety eight was the first smarter than boxing ring you are and and then I was curious I started thinking about what was the border murders the exporters\nAnd if there's any connection to them to\nSee it it's a fair question the question we get a lot is a it could these be connected to New Orleans packs murderers and and the answer that with his easy no they're absolutely not connected to New Orleans ax murder the but the losing boarding cases not as easy to uh\nTo reject because of a time and place however it's quite a bit\nThis is not as easy to ah to reject because of a time and place\nHowever it's quite a bit different than our murders ... committed with a heavy AK ... in the middle of the night the Lizzie Borden murders committed with really a a hand they hatch at hand held a hatch it in the middle of the day and and they do not have really any of the\nBut I don't have very many of the signature elements of our crime so I don't think they're connected all by camp\nOr I couldn't say that it you know an odd connection between the two crimes is that uh\nThat you probably know that in that Lizzie Borden case there was a man staying with the uh uh the board and family are on the night before they were murdered and he was a a farmer who had a farm maybe ten miles from Alaska\nSo that's an odd connection\n[noise] uh and uh I think that Lizzie Borden pieces interesting I think it was the first thing that came to mind for a lot of people and and maybe speaks to the idea of going into it it does connect in the sense that it was a family\nIt was a house it was ... and then it was a it may be a crime of opportunity um in in grabbing an action that was near a hat you know that was that the property that to inside\nUm and the idea that it was in and out\nReally quickly and then nothing was stolen which is another piece because you know that was ... you know why why would somebody going to the house and killed were it not for that that was the part of the motives piece that was presented you know against Lizzie Borden was that she stood do inherent property which makes sense\nBut I did it did give me

the Halloween festivities that are coming up we'll talk more about that coming up and just a second and we'll\nWe'll go around the horn 'em to a couple of places that are celebrating\nHalloween on the way this Wednesday of course George Will have a terrific Wednesday night Halloween show but\nUh we'll also talk with a J W Oscar who's the author of the season with the witch and it's a whole book about the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts you might remember a show we did a couple of months ago\nAbout uh the Salem witch trials and how historians have been changing their views on who were the victims or rather whether they were like really that much of a victim in it so it was fascinating go back if you remember of\nCoast insider and listen for it but coming up next our this is another\nSo it was fascinating go back if you're a member of coast insider and listen for it\nBut coming up next our this is another sort of historical trip I think you're just going to love along the rails of America the men from the train discovering America's most elusive serial killer\nOh this this is this is a great story you'll love hearing about it with Bill James who was a\nA writer and not just of um of general interest books like that but also he's a a sports writer or in Boston and he was of course following very closely what happen tonight\nIn Los Angeles we're not competing again he extended the Dodgers ended up playing last night\nUh it was like a double header rolled up into one single game uh but uh but tonight a little different uh Bo Sox lead the series now three to one the\nDodgers will get another shot at it coming up tomorrow night to send the series back to Boston three to two but\nVersion of a robot before the ... version of a robot um the robot that is created in the very first version of I robot which was in the late Nineteen thirties or sits down and read Frankenstein and then has a better understanding\nOf life afterwards anyway the experiments that inspired Frankenstein are up at coast to coast am dot com to a great story to read and and also this one to from the sun\nAbout eight or a cover up that may have been exposed\nGoogle Earth blind spot over the experimental military base\nMaybe where US government hides crushed UFOs that according to the defense insider you'll see more about that about the the ... test range in Nevada um and what they had recently uncovered but but if they did\nWell then you know they would become the new Roswell\nI'm kinda happy with the old Roswell and I'm very grateful that we have a chance to talk to who was needed Jennings who joins us on the phone on coast to coast am good evening Juanita\nCan evening so Juanita is the director of public affairs for Roswell\nI'm and she promotes Roswell as a travel and and you know as a professional opportunity and people move to Roswell all the time but this is the time of year where you get a lot of tourists to come in for the Halloween festivities so I just wanted to ask you what your plans\nWere for Halloween what do you do if if if Ross was kind of Halloween all your lungs in a way for some people with the discussion of\nAliens and invading armies and all of that if if it's if it's a Halloween all year long what do you do special for Halloween\n[noise] um most people go out to grade farm which is a local farm and ranch community just about seven miles out of town where they participate in the coordinates\nAre the greatest family ah the coordinates together like the hieroglyphics that were supposedly on a UFO spaceship that landed in Nineteen forty seven or they can get every single year and it's just a great opportunity for people that go out and really try to experience aren't\n... aren't that feeling of getting our NFL life you're of a crack in Nineteen forty seven\nOther people go out to bottom or break state park ah which again has a mystery at bottom rare and and it is our ten miles from Roswell beautiful a great place to argue camp and things like that but\nAgain I'm more more of the stars and the telescope and people get dressed up and they feel that a become one or they may come down and uh you know it's just that that the area there is something here that land it and they're trying to connect with an especially around\nHalloween and during the UFO festival in July\n... so I I I'll be traveling through Roswell I'm I'm moving coming up I'm In a couple of weeks and I'll be driving up through rose well on my way to\nA new position I'll be teaching it to Kansas State and my my older my younger son and I was always wanted to go to Roswell right so we we we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to dip hunter Roswell before we come back up again and it seems\nWe we mapped it out from Phoenix even though we have to go a little bit out of our way to get onto the Roswell before we come back up again and it seemed totally worth it to us just to be able to see it but how much can people tour when they're out there anybody we're interested in in being able to\nGo to the crash site um or to go to any of the other locations that are linked to the famous story of depression Roswell were what can they do\nSo they can go to the rival on international UFO museum and Research Center which um is a great opportunity to really dive into their historical and the research a part of the crash I'm definitely would check out the library for those who are really the seekers and do you believe\nA in addition to that we have a U.S a tour of that is done by a local researcher he's been doing research on the crash and UFOs for over twenty plus years and he will take\nYou to the exact locations of the timing of the incident and on top of that during the festival not next week but during the festival for the first time last year the bulk or families where the crash occurred allegedly they will take you out to the crash site where a knack for themselves rent\nA house is still kind of in\nIn place and you can see where the crater landed in in the land\nAnd so those are just a couple of of things that I Would definitely recommend\nThat people check out and um you know search for the troops themselves\nOkay so ... to use the word allegedly in there which makes me suspect you're not a true believer of what happened you know something we don't know\nI I Do believe there are some people still are kind of on the fence and so we invite people to come and find out for themselves\nA we know there's a lot of research there's a lot of a local people here that um people can talk to you when you go into the UFO museum uh the locals know who the tourists are because\nAt the sticker and you will come and walk down our main street and go into areas that one which is a great store I bring your camera take pictures stop in the ... visitor center we have to amazing aliens that we'd decorate for each holiday especially now for\nHalloween puts on a big fall festival with our police officers and things like that for the community\nBut um these they're about six foot aliens and ah people love to take pictures with them and you'll hear the story of you know are employers the month his name is Bob and mark the alien and\nUh you know people really come here searching for the truth and we as locals we we don't want to say one way or the other we want them to figure it out for themselves and and you can research\nWell that'd be great thank you appreciate the let me let me ask you how many people show up every year in Raj well for the Roswell festival for the for the crash festival that happens in the summer the UFO days\nUm so our population has doubled in size we're we're a town about forty eight thousand and especially on the big anniversary of the festival um you know we've hit close to doubling our size on average per year for tourism we see a little over two hundred and\nThirty thousand visitors that on the UFO museum and Research Center\nHunting good really good and pretty close to what they get in Salem, Massachusetts a until all of bringing our next guest next but thank you want to you know and if I'm if I'm driving the time we get a chance we'll say hello okay yes\nSince uh and so I'll I'll bring in our next guest next but thank you Juanita and if I'm if I'm driving through town we get a chance of say hello okay\nYeah I think they're\nCorny to Jennings is the uh the the the director of tourism or public affairs in uh Roswell New Mexico a season with the which Jay W Oscar\nThe subtitle is the magic and mayhem of Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts a Gemini let me just tell you very funny book you're either a great sense of humor really enjoy all the sort of a comic sides on a serious subject because\nAnd we'll get to the second this is this is a very unusual place in America but it has an even more extraordinary place in the timeline\nOf American history but I thought it was interesting you mentioned that in Salem, Massachusetts they do about a quarter of a million people that come to visit during the month of October or is it about right\n[noise] yeah it's about right there are about forty thousand usually I'm On Halloween just how itself it's about a hundred thousand people come um and of course of the month and a quarter million though the massive amount of people for the small city to have a the borders\n[noise] well I Love this idea so this is one of my favorite kind of books it's a deep drill down on like a well I mean it's not it's not a narrow subject but you picked\nHalloween insane the subject so it sort of you use that as a as a sort of a lens on all of what happened in and the implications of the uh the Salem witch trials um but it's it's really informative and we just get a guest a couple of weeks ago\nAbout a on the popular opinion on how historians have been shifting their views\nOn Salem and I you know I learned a lot then too but we'll learn a little bit more tonight for example\nI didn't realize that a ... ... that there are other places around the world outside of Salem that had massive\nHanging and burnings of of which is before Salem, Massachusetts did\nYeah I always try to tell people that felt wasn't the first ever which trial wasn't the last one the ... and do a trial wasn't the biggest wasn't the strangest for them you know there are [noise] you know the first for trout America you'll at a victim was in Connecticut and Europe they're reaching like thousands of victims of course yeah injuries\nBut we don't really hear about that which is really I mean I Know that there there are some festivals in Europe that they keep that alive but still that's an extraordinary number of which killed\nIt isn't it out it's really a problem today even in in um those are developed countries are still being people being executed for being with us but the strange thing about that to me of course all of the planet that have had this problem just pretty much every day on the planet there's only one which city and that's Salem, Massachusetts\nThe government protects the costs of Medicare plants will decrease this year so you have to ask yourself are you getting the best right help markets offers a free service with access to thousands of Medicare plans nationwide to help folks maximize their benefits and save on\nWhat is it people need to keep in mind\nEnrollment in the right plan is not automatic with so many Medicare options that can be confusing\nMy advice don't go at it won't get unbiased helped to find a plan that may cost less and cover more with lower copayments more choices like dental and vision and the freedom to choose your doctors with the enrollment deadline only weeks away it's important to act now our health markets Medicare assistance as freight\nThanks my this is Michael ... for health markets\nFor your free Medicare assistance coal eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two that's eight hundred six nine for forty five forty to eight hundred six nine for forty five forty two\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nSo er Jay W ... author of a season with the which I just had to look up some of those steps that we had mentioned more vaguely two thousand eleven viral do Norway erected a memorial to the Ninety One victims of seventeenth century witch hunt linkage your England\nA long ago turned its ... which is incident in which ten people were hanged and sixteen twelve and toured tourist draw in Sweden which memorial for the more than Seventy victims who were beheaded and burned in sixteen Seventy five\nIn Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in the late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole\nI live in Germany a staggering four hundred and fifty victims in late Fifteen hundred generally sixteen hundreds in Spain a whole museum dedicated to the witch trials in which some seven thousand people were accused and that's just some of them and not even all that happened\nIn America but at Salem that sticks out and so why why do you do you conclude Salem, Massachusetts has become so synonymous with the craft\n[noise] it's it's really a mystery honestly even that's one of the big question that go with the book and I think it's a combination of probably two dozen different factors honestly that gets Salem as which city one of which of course is that where you know it's in the United states of America and the U.S kind of invented marketing\n[laughter] oh yeah that's a big part of it but I mean not a big part of it that's a small part of it but there's about a dozen other reasons why kind of Salem grabbed onto that moniker and kind of held on to it you know over the course of about two centuries\nBut it's kind of a ... it's the moniker of shame ... right I mean it's not that's not usually what a town holds onto you know that even you know it's we just talked to somebody from Roswell in and that that was an incident that was that happened there\nBut ... and they they take advantage of it for you know tourism purposes and for whatever other reason they want but it's like usually words you don't hear about Chicago celebrating the fact that it was the home\nOf that crazy serial killer tree famous worlds exposition right you don't know that he does go on their way to put up signs and go it happened here folks\n[laughter] right now to get through it I think to persuade for that one is that\nYou know the tragedy in Salem itself was basically just to the court happened in Salem right it was a civic part of the trials right actual family members and you know the people who really bear that shame over the course of generations are around Salem the actual the actual stereo started next door to what's now Denver's was at the time to film village so\nSale itself doesn't really have a kind of kind of a generational connection to it it was just the sight of the civic proceedings\nUm and then on top of that today which city means way more than just the victim was trials I mean the actual which is I live there today it means the cartoon which that's kind of represents Halloween since ... since then it was kind of become Halloween count as well so it's a determined which has a lot of different definitions for Salem today at twenty Eighteen\nYeah I guess ... and this is important in this ... this great distinction\nCan't help but feel do and sometimes I Can't get away from just remembering that this this really is about innocent victims of murder were executed and they protested their innocence until the end and there's a whole industry tend to build up around them now\n[noise] yeah not a big ... dealing with that responsibly as something that feeling of kind of ruffled with for you know probably two centuries and a lot in the past few decades especially figuring out how to balance you know the actual tragedy the kind of underneath the underneath or Fort Worth so to speak\nAnd part of it that's left connected to the tragedy with more just around you know a city identity and all these other kind of thing just become and into an Eighteen\nWell go back to my central question than from last half hour which is then how do they celebrate Halloween in Salem, Massachusetts\nAh with with absolute pandemonium [laughter] he is so they they don't celebrate Halloween\nDay I mean they celebrate a season basically so that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really bled over into\nSeason basically so that they felt it was called haunted happenings which technically starts October first and October thirty first um but really lead over into longer than that\nSo if you want to experience Salem don't go in October don't go in late October go in September early October or any other time of the year do you want to visit found the Halloween you're just going to get pandemonium crowds it's a lot of fun but it's definitely a different type of experience from the city of failing itself\nIt's Mardi Gras beads\nIt is it really is um you're talking again a hundred thousand people packed to the small down time of the city for failing to the city but doesn't have high rises it's not like you know massive it's a small city and it's everything happens within you know five or six blocks\nAnd you have a hundred thousand people there to party to wear costumes the freaky each other out to you know go to go to bars watch the fireworks all kinds of stuff so you're you're definitely there for you know again Mardi Gras is a good analogy because you're not really experiencing New Orleans\nMardi Gras you're experiencing Mardi Gras during Mardi Gras\nUm but ... and I imagine for a lot of times in October ... which is to in ... in in there so you're probably not going to get the same ... did you get in Mardi Gras anyway but there's probably some amount of alcohol than consumed during this deliberation\nDefinitely actually right now we're in the middle of a nor'easter so that you know cuts families on right now for Halloween weekend last weekend before Halloween [noise] right yeah those are the part of it this is within the party\n[noise] okay so ... ... you mentioned haunted happenings but I mean it's a little known for being hunted either ... or there were a lot of money and houses were were there are there still visitations from the victims of the original Salem trial\nOh yeah there's all kinds of algae around that it's it's really hard not to have that mythology like if you didn't want it it'd be hard to fight it off because you have again everything you need for what the classic haunting right you're innocent victims\nYou have monsters because of the Senate most trial then just involved which is in the story involves demons and empty and shaped sisters and goes everything we're in the trials for the big monster mass so you have all those kind of elements and then you have a city that has you know four hundred years of history or up three hundred and Thirty years of history\nSo that is just you know a lot of people over the centuries so yeah there's there's all that kind of stuff happening in the ... um ghost tours there's spooky places there's the other side of the executions you have everything you need to build the kind of spooky mythology around the city\nNow you've been there most of these I should say you've been there right you go there to oh yeah all the time I was there two weeks ago\nSo what have you ever gone and seen anything that was paranormal related that seemed to be still situated didn't and in some dimension around Salem\n[laughter] you know I haven't but it's it's my fault so I I built a career kind of a visiting strange places spending the night of the band that asylum and murders and all kinds of things and I've never had an experience\nSo my interest that that is more than the stories themselves you know until the day I have an experience my interest is more than the stories of it in Salem is chock full of like this really great spooky you know goes the stories are on that but no I haven't had anything cool happened to me yeah\nWhat's so what's the best what's the best ... story that post Salem witch trials that you've captured while you've been there\n[noise] um well what are the ones that really creepy ones is one of the Boston stream of victims happened in Salem so it has that kind of connection to like a real you know real actual historical events that then I can reverberate and have kind of all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape on the jails there so all these kind of spiritual is\nAnd I can reverberate and have kind of all around that Houdini also visited Salem and like escape from the jails there so all these kind of spiritual is kind of and you know the cops kind of events happened in Salem that nothing to do with the witch trials\nAll that kind of some kind of feed into that kind of cauldron of a of a mythology around Salem\nYeah but Houdini was a bunker right he was somebody there to celebrate and he was or somebody to to to mock these people that we're creating these images so I'm ... ... was there an attempt to for him to do like ... or something while he was there\nNo no he was so there's a the building actually still stands it's a it's a condominium or apartment complex now but it used to be the original jail there the original police station and he was just there doing one of those things that used to do what he was in towns are performing who go to a local police station or somewhere and perform a quick active you know escape\nAs a PR move for his next big event so now he wasn't down there doing more of a say on busing but who is doing is a is a scape escape retain\nLike ... ... ... you you mentioned that there are still which is in Salem how did they get along with this idea of the the ... celebrating painted the victim who did these innocent people who denied that they were which is where do they how do they play into\nIf the historical West is what you want

I I just want to make it clear that real life murder is not a parlor game\nUh whenever we speak of murder it's important to remember that the lives lost whether it's one desk whether it's Jack the ripper the Boston Straggler\nThe wages of Salem or the most elusive serial killer in American history about which will be talking to night the lives lost represent children who will never see adulthood adults that will never see their children grow\nYoung men and women who had their human potential to offer the world taken away truly innocent people who died at the hands of evil\nIn the words of Clint Eastwood in one of my favorite movies are unforgiving it's a hell of a thing killing them and take away all that he's got an old that he's ever going to have\nOh well yeah ... and and I will tell you though it it did present a small problem regarding\nOur interview tonight because I had started to read the book and then I was told but if the red Sox make the series he can't beyond with us\nSo I had read about the first three chapters and then when I heard the Bo Sox made it into the series I I packed the book\nIn my boxes that are heading to Kansas 'cause I'm moving decay state understand you live in Lawrence, Kansas a lot of\nThe two of them on\nSo I'm moving to Manhattan meant so it'll be ... will be like almost neighbors and yet\nI wound up in Manhattan I Am very well and I like\nTotally cool so so I packed\nThe book and then I got the call like four days later and always good to go [laughter] like uh the book isn't what they had they had to overnight me a book so I had it in my hand but unfortunately awesome and I lost a few days reading time so I haven't finished yet and I love nothing more than doing an interview on a book I finished reading\nEspecially because I can tell already you're building up to a climax than I Do not want to miss with\nThe true story of the the ah the America's most elusive serial killer demand from the train so you're in Lawrence, Kansas and your your co author is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nAbout quarter to my daughter ... daughter my daughter\nKansas and your your coauthor is your wife Rachel McCarthy James\nAbout quarter to my daughter read gone with my daughter she she's a she worked with me on a book [noise]\nOkay it doesn't specify that's what I did make an assumption I'm Sorry I should have a ticket\nThat out and then ... say that but I worked\nOut well it probably did similar but I didn't see it but in any event I just wanted to say I'm a great book obviously deserves all the accolades that ... that you are getting for it and the fact that you very likely crack this case\nUm is very much to your credit so I I Want to start if I can with the uh by the way to congratulations on the ... of the red Sox win tonight and what a game last night good thing you weren't booked for last night huh\n[laughter] yeah I Would add to cancel out a little bit of torture [laughter] to keep them on a we have to be going bill well over here on earth\nBut you and we mentioned the Boston Straggler last uh last hour you have some experience researching that to do I get that right\n[noise] oh I wouldn't say so they ah I wrote about the Boston Straggler along with hundreds of other ... are going to book I wrote maybe six or seven years ago called popular crime or a ... I did um\nUh I was living in Boston at the time that I was writing that book so I took an interest in the box and stronger case and publish some theories about which may be right or wrong who knows\n[laughter] well I Love that I ... I may revisited that 'cause I've always been very interested in that as well but the mentioned the train is a story it does it speaks to something I mentioned earlier I was interviewing once and ruled the queen of true crime and I asked her once I said is is there any story\nToo old to be told\nOr when it comes to you know retailing a story about a murder and she said absolutely not\nShe said it doesn't matter how old the story is she said which which best is it's actually\nYou is the author can bring something new to the story if you can solve it that's the best thing especially one that has either been\nIncorrectly adjudicated which we know is certainly a case in in the book so far as I read it but also it's true all the time that there will be there'll be somebody who's falsely accused sometimes even convicted sometimes even executed\nJust isn't the case here in the demand from the train a series of murders are happening around the country nobody is connecting them\nYet but in in one at least in one case a ... a a a local guy is accused of robbing a family and killing them and he ends up being killed for being executed for it and there was nothing he could do even though we know now these totally innocent\nThey write their their tip while they're there for people who were extra lovely executed\nFor crimes that may have been committed by the man trying to do with them I Would go so far as to say I'm fairly certain of the crime was committed by the man from the train but a local person was executed and I'm Alive\nThe or the other two it could have happened but you can't say for sure they uh\nUh but there there were also nine people nine black people who were murdered by a Lynch mob\nWho when I was for crimes that were almost certainly committed by right from the track\nWhat year did the murders start\nFirst with an Eighteen Ninety eight alas that we are pretty sure that was him ... although there was a very interesting\nEighteen Ninety eight the last that we are pretty sure that was him was Nineteen quote all although there was a ... there's an interesting crime ten years later that has earmarked but we can't say that at Penn\nSo I looked in the ... I was trying to find an index for the book because I grew up in a town called ... or ... Illinois I saw the town where I'm home alone takes place I grew up not too far away from the the home alone house I'm ... and\n... the mayor\nIn around the turn of the century in were neck and one of the first mayors of the town\nI'm was murdered along with his wife in their home\nIn a crime that was never solved then they happen to live right by the railroad tracks is that right yeah\nAnd it was a story I'd always been told by my mother because um she was kind of into this sort of thing where I get it and uh and ... the the belief was always it was just some drifter who came off the train broke into the house robbed them and then was able to catch a train and get up and they never found them\nUm but when I was reading this not thinking wait a second that could be somebody else in the in the chart of demand from the train\n[noise] they ... it is possible where have we assumed\nThat we did not find every crime that he committed with just we found those uh which there were enough signature\nA sick segment or a characteristics of the crime that you could say with some degree of confidence that they're both with him but they they may well have committed and probably did commit other crimes\nThat are we just did not have enough information about it but that that's a new and actually I I I've never heard that story before at all and if you hear my parents' scratching at writing down\n[laughter] when a murder or a hundred years ago\nI tried to actually find out something this afternoon on it I couldn't\nUm and I wondered whether somebody maybe from the Historical Society had more details but it was Saturday and I couldn't get a hold of anybody\nBut it made me think about it and so if I had gotten something wrong you know forgive me but it's worth a ... a poke anyway so how many people do we think were murdered along America's railroad tracks by a single perpetrator\nDemand from the train or who's anonymous for a reason or ... you know during this period\n[noise] well what Rachel I did was we\nPut the murders and buckets right there's a hundred percent ... that that is crimes were certain ... Seventy percent bucket or forty percent bucket American percent bucket right and I'm white total up the numbers of murders and each bucket and multiplied by their likelihood\nThat I'm a ... that ah\nIt was our our criminal and the murder the total came up with is a hundred and one that actually include the two people who were murdered who were executed by the state a lot for crimes they committed and they the uh somewhere\nBetween four and nine people who were who were murdered by a Lynch mob for crimes that he either did commit or it may have committed\nSome germs are the actual murders and his own hands as opposed to murders for which he would be responsible including the executions\nAs murders because they were innocent um do we say somewhere around Ninety like a solid Ninety victims his guy because that's right All right so ... gets through a a typical\nCrime as you as you see the pattern developing\nRight All right so ... gets through a a typical crime as you as you see the pattern developing in the late ... uh nineteenth century early twentieth century what was this guy's him oh\nWell this is a long this could be a long answer I'm not a long winded person booth could be a long answer because there are a lot of things the tie them together the crimes happen near midnight almost all of the crimes happen within an hour at midnight\nA family is murder most often a family including a young girl is murdered without any warning and with no known enemies they\nLive usually in a small ... at a town too small to have a police department [noise]\nThey live near the intersection of two railroad tracks\nThe I'm a very often bodies are moved their killed with an act the act is found in the in the yard of the victims are in the yard of a neighbor and they act as a van and at the end of the crime or handlers washed her finger prime\nThe house is locked up tight all the windows are the window shades of polls windows if necessary are covered with black it so that you can't see it all the doors are all law the or or\nThis killer or the one from this morning but just because there's a lot of doubles and running around these days including son devils getting big we should say the kind of fun a show the we were just a hated the interrupt you because you were doing such a great job with the\nExplanation about the the similarities between the cases and I I think you were coming up to the end but I had to cut you off because we had the heartbreaking ... really it was\nGraduate or after they because I was going to run out of things to say but I was able to find\nThe heart of touch every little bit\nMore than ... what's that\nI should like thirty four of them aren't there or something or\nSomething like that they ah they ah the crime you normally occurred on Sunday night for you to hurt on the weekends\nUp until Nineteen pan crimes almost all occurred and areas in which the primary industry was ballgame or one of the primary understood was logging\nThe or doors doors and windows ... Jeff shot I think I mentioned that they um\n[noise] there's all their clarity a graphic patterns and the murders if one occurs just south of Portland them extra curse just north of Portland or so that that would be a a link between them they uh\nUh one thing that is odd is that he would he would take our lap from inside the house turn the way way down low surges gave out a little bit of light take the chairman a awful lap unfettered on the floor usually under a table\nA and then carry the lamp around with him as he committed murders\nAnd the other thing is that he would put poet blankets over the head of a free in person or a half a second before you went ahead with an axe or you did a lot and they probably did that to keep the blood from flying back and hitting hitting him if he was\nPerjuring someone there are quite a detailed pattern of behavior\nYeah very interesting and so this is starting in the in the late Nineteen century and going to the early twentieth century following along logging lines that actually would be consistent with where this murder happened it's not that the\nTown that I grew up in his logging town but it was in between logging towns and if you just go north up into Wisconsin where that line started\nUm that was plenty of logging was going on in in Wisconsin it was it was insane for that matter Michigan just around the other side of Chicago so very likely could have could have followed them ... another\nThing I forgot to mention there all the all in warm weather with one one possible exception there's one crime that he very may have ... whether it's first crime which was just an outburst of anger and not\nAnd not a plan to vent probably that occurred in cold weather but he had to flee through a cold weather and after that he never murdered anybody cold weather it's always warm weather\n[noise] um we're talking about America's most elusive serial killer and Ninety would he be America's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt yeah it it probably might be like\nAmerica's most prolific serial killer or is there anybody else who's contending for that to be around\nIt yeah it it probably might be but I had this discussion with my with my publisher which I Would have which was that they were going to want to say was the worst serial murder in American history or the first or something murder is by its nature done in secret\nOr the ... that in fact that is that is one of the earliest definitions of the word murder is a killing on a secret there because it has done in in secret the facts about it are never\nFully known and are not ah not normally are fully exposed and um you get a lot of different people who claimed to be\nThe worst serial murder in American history I don't think anyone has a better claim to that disgusting title than this this person but uh I'd I'd I wouldn't want to make it because the reality is we just can't document all the crimes to be attributed to a really anybody\n[noise] yeah I mean it's fair to say that if they were the most successful serial killer of all time very likely nobody would ever know about it and they ... they could have done these things\nUsing drifters or people without ... much in the way that you know some serial killers have already performed but in the area of like ten to Fifteen victims Sprite or John Wayne gay see using runaways and other things that helped him to elude capture for so long so\nBut the demands on the train is is he is he's called ... we have to call them that although we get to what you think you'd be discovered about this in terms of solving the crime a little bit later on almost don't want to because they don't want to ruin so close to you know finishing I was reading all afternoon your easily but then there's a couple of good football games distracting dinner\nSo the ... but this guy he nobody in the president does him for us to just assume\nThat there was some national awareness of the killer who was lurking along Americans railways be careful if you have a whole new train tracks now because there is a guy going in between all of these towns what kind of word was going out which is\nAbout killers along trains during this killing spree\nWell from Eighteen Ninety eight Nineteen eleven nothing at all the ... and that this has to do with the organization of the wire services at that time in Eighteen Ninety eight of wire services were at a very primitive stage and because that's true information had very little\nUh immigration of this type have little ability to spread from town to town by Nineteen twelve the national wire services were\nWere organized a story that was printed in a small town somewhere it would be picked up by the Associated Press or your PI or or the other wire services of that era and published all over the nation so after he had been killing people for about twelve years\nIn October of Nineteen eleven all of a sudden there was a a sudden awareness that this was happening so when he went to his most famous crime ... in June of Nineteen twelve everybody knew immediately that this is him and this is the latest crime in this\nTerrible series that's been going on but for the first\nMore than ten years that he was killing people nobody was connecting the dots at all even when\nLogically they should have that even though you you look at the crimes and there's a case in Virginia West Virginia where two crimes are committed six weeks apart the a ... and ... pounds that it's a little less than eighty miles from one to the other as the crow flies and you\nThe uh uh and and towns that it's a little less than ... miles from one to the other as the crow flies and you and the crimes are extremely similar and there's no other crime like that I mean we're in the United states and all the rest of the year\nYou would think that people would connect the dots but they didn't they add the first crime was was hung on the shoulders of a man our little who was later executed for and the second crime was it was investigated as a totally separate events\nAnd that was interesting because they were so close to each other\nBut that doesn't just speak to the lack of say the development in the Associated Press wire or it doesn't it's not just that it's also it speaks to the insurgency of the jurisdiction of sharing a police departments and sheriff's departments and there was no national\nOr investigative a body of like the FBI yet so there was nobody that you would report these two anyway that was going to keep track of what was happening around the country at the same time\nThat's exactly true and that introduces us also into one of the major themes of the book which is the and you know I've been writing about crime for a long time I'm [laughter] I thought I was probably knowledgeable about it I was astonished to\nRealize how backward and ineffective address additional system was just a hundred years ago ... it's beyond belief how primitive the investigative\nProcess that's war at the time of the crimes and what the man from the train did was to\nExploit the curia weaknesses of of the of the criminal justice system to evade capture they ah they knew that if you committed a crime and got out of town before the crime was discovered\nThat was no no way really to\nTo connect it to him and he knew that if he committed a crime and the big city the police were going to be all over it but if he committed a crime in a small town that had no police force first of all it took them two weeks to get their boots on but but even when they did they have no resources to come after him\nAnd and forensic medicine hadn't even really started yet I mean there's ... ... and ... this was a ... and then ... I'll even throw in another ... even in prosecuting that some of the things we we learn um is that even up until the Nineteen forties\nI'm juries were completely suspicious of crime science\nUm yeah and I I wrote about this little bit in in the uh in a true crime book I had written about this murder that happened in my family in that they the ... the jury's the the the defense attorneys appealed to the religious nature of the jury's\nBy telling them this is who do it's it's not science", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "28"}
