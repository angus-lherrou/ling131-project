fell in love at C. F. R. B. ten ten so there you go a coming of an hour is one and two lieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis or as we say up\nInvestment in sophisticated mass killing weapons the People's Republic of China\nIs a great power with global ambitions led by a new kind of communist leader focused on a rapidly growing his nation economically and militarily\nAnd together China and Russia collaborate to dominate our future and that pseudo alliance could well become the catalyst that leads to the prophetic and times\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis author of alliance of evil is here for hours one and two hours three and four and let's see what shall we do I thought maybe we could exchange some veal recipes\nAnd of course they're continuing to fuel the anti key of a civil war which I call them the eastern part of the country and that's after having seized Crimea and of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland\nAnd of course two provinces in two thousand and eight from the republic of Georgia and they're pushing back against the Baltics against Poland Hungary Romania or the entire a former Soviet satellite regimes\nAh that's something that I Know when Mr Yeltsin or the new president after Gorbachev stepped down came to this country met with Bush Camp David [noise] we had the opportunity to do more than just give them a few crumbs we could have\nBrought them into the fold and I think that that really is you indicate ... you know fueled the rise of Vladimir putting and you know ... of course has captured the imagination of the Russian people and as a direct result\nHas really fueled\nNationalism and patriotism in a way that a ... they're somewhat um I Would argue blind to perhaps what the West is looking at because\nThey want to rise again they want to be a great power again and they do have them the means through their nuclear arsenal and of course I'm putting you know here even this week when he was down and so she was arguing that you know we have a modern weapons systems\nThat really a push against the emergent and they're very capable west and he talked about the oven Guarda twenty time speed of sound a nuclear capable go anywhere breakthrough any a defense system\nWeapon system a hyper sonic weapon system much like what the Chinese are working on so the Russians are really for to find themselves they're pushing back they are concerned about NATO and we did violate a the initial trust that we wouldn't push against them we did and so we find ourselves\nIn a very dangerous position today a visa V. not only of course putting but also president Xi in China\n[noise] how much has the narrative of Russian collusion hand cost the Trump Administration into perhaps\nSmoothing over relations pulling back from the brink if you will because now\nBecause everyone is seeing a I'm a Russian under their bed in the closet in the White House um that he has to be asked to appear\nAlmost overly aggressive against the Russian how much has this this Russian collusion narrative endangered American national security\nWell I I think that it has and in fact potent said once again this week\nThat he believes that Trump clearly wants to stabilize and improve U.S Russian ties\nYou know when they met together\nAnd Helsinki this July uh they talked about a host of issues not of course all those are are not out in the open because president's talking confidence about things of concern but one of the things he talked about was the ridicule reduction of nuclear weapons throughout the world and of course it starts with both Russia and\nThe United states I think that a President Trump is pragmatic he he does want to you know kind of get the rhetoric lower or not only with the Russians but with the Chinese now if people argue well what's he doing with this trade war and and like\nWell he's representing if you look at the national security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people\nFor security strategy and the national defense strategy that were published in the last year\nHe is trying to make sure that people understand America is first he's not going to sit back and see other countries take advantage of it is but at the same time he does want stability he does want the in the tensions uh but at the same time it's very high today for a variety of reasons\nWell let's pivot to China you mentioned the trade wars [laughter] uh ... and how people need to appreciate how this trade war strategy or terrorists uh against China is is not just economic it's also national security and that if\nI Would argue if we don't engage in this trade war now\nWe're going to have to end up fighting on the battlefield later is this an attempt to weaken China significantly economically so that they can't uh a cheese military supremacy over the United states\nWell clearly we have as the number one and number two economic powers in the world there is a lot of competition but there's a lot of commonality a lot of mutual interest\nTo keep both economy's going along\nAnd the Chinese and in the last year or so have seen somewhat of a you know there are what six and a half percent growth in the last quarter which is down over the previous quarters [noise] uh [noise] but the fact is that we need one another\nAnd yet if we continue to allow them to take jobs to manipulate you know our businesses and Robert intellectual property and Trump says well we're losing something like three hundred billion dollars of intellectual property to\nChinese you know not only cyber attacks but through your company to company relationship and company to state relationship with Beijing then that's a national security issue he makes it very clear and the national security strategy that\nYou know economics is national security\nWe can't afford to lose jobs we can't afford to let\nOur wealth go to China and so he's trying to level the playing field he wants a fair playing field arguably president she said much the same but from a very different position so are there hopefully gonna meet within the month maybe in Argentina will see\nAnd if they do maybe we can get kind of movement in the right direction I Know the Chinese media is is trying to figure out Trump you know just like the\nAmbassador to Washington from Beijing said on Fox News this past weekend they can't figure him out and I think that's to the Americans advantage you always want to keep your opponent you're adversary or even your friends to a certain degree guessing and Mr Trump certainly does that\nIt is a ... alliance of evil yeah between the Russians and the Chinese and perhaps there are other uh components to this Islamic terrorism perhaps but in terms of ... the Russians and the Chinese becoming\nUm the bed me is is driven by ... in any way are are there still vestiges of a communist ideology here or is this simply about hedging many\nWell as a combination of things uh I don't it's not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy as it was I Would argue during the old Cold War um\nI I don't if not as simple as communism versus liberal democracy if it was I Would argue during the old Cold War\nA potent for his own ideology is about order and bringing jobs back to Russia bringing confidence in where the nation is as opposed to what they would call an amoral west\nA and the things that they represent they paint or the west is what Hollywood is viewing all over the world and they said you don't want that in fact\nYou know putting is is famous for embracing Christianity and family values and\nYeah and the things that you know used to resonate in the United states in the fifties so he you know even though he ... he still is perceived widely as a leader of the common man\nIn the ... in Russia and as a result there's a lot of confidence in him you know they have adversaries but\nYou know it was just this week you had you know a gentleman by the name of Valerie ... who is the chairman for Russia's constitutional court who even started to you know hint\nAt perhaps we ought to amend our constitution much like the Chinese did this past year and allow potent in this case to serve\nBeyond twenty twenty four because he was just elected of course ah\nYeah this past march you know they're beginning to see that we need longevity and we need to have the capability to ah keep the momentum going in and they feel confident that food is doing that much as the Chinese are feeling confident and president Xi is well\nYou're not exactly painting prudent as an evil adversary and yet the ... the title of the book is alliances evil so why why should we aside from the fact that the Russians have a vast nuclear arsenal\nWhy should we be fearing ... and an alliance with China\nWell what they're doing is they're weaponize eat everything against us you know if you look at political ...\nPredatory economics strategic extortion information warfare um covert action you know I I could go through every one of those Richard and there was a long history and in fact in alliance of evil I go through sixteen indicators in which those things just\nThis online banks for closing on how they even have documents then I signed for home equity loan only I didn't what a

Cold War has the mystery of the end times finally arrived\nWho do you perceive us the greater threat right now to the United States Russia or China\nImmediate threat Richard is Russia a given their provocations\nBut also a military capability or which they're not shy to exercise around the globe I'm very you know the chief of naval operations animal rich\nOr have said recently we were in the fourth battle of the Atlantic the first one was in World War one Second World war two the old Cold War with the third one or the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and a beautiful\nOr with the third one now the Russians have put in place a nuclear submarine and you know a ... a diesel powered submarines that are just as capable almost as certainly hours not only in the\nAtlantic but Mediterranean and elsewhere and of course are confronting us militarily or in the air or they're back off our coastlines are they're very aggressive in terms of cyber as we know all about the allegations and\nIn justifiably are the sanctions put in place because of their interference in the twenty sixteen election in here recently or in the twenty Eighteen mid terms we arrested\nOr someone of course this was a Chinese person or in Belgium you know these sorts of things are not to be ignored or the Russians are\nBellicose and they're you know claims against us and to a certain degree now we're pushing back you know President Trump's not a you know backing down and that I gave them if there's you know some given some take but maybe\nA it's not a favoring an outcome that uh is going to suit is all ah and then of course you joined that with what's going on with the Chinese and perhaps in the south China Sea East China sea and of course their belt and road strategy ... an issue all over the world where they're buying\nUp infrastructure and using that as a\nWay of planting their People's Liberation army capabilities you know literally across the globe you know do I say Russia is more dangerous now China is certainly the long term more dangerous adversary\n[noise] while we vanquished the former Soviet Union economically we brought them to their knees or they have an economy which is why they're GDP about the size of Texas now why why couldn't we do that again with another arms race\nWell we are in an arms race or I mentioned earlier the hyper sonic weapons that\nAre putting puts forward keep in mind you know you're right there GDP is miniscule compared to ours um but they hide a lot of the stuff so it's not really as obvious as one would think in terms of how much they're really plowing into their capabilities\nNow he said this week you know we have these capabilities and our experts don't contest that yes they are working on capabilities and they probably will feel them and and the near future and are they willing to use it as well put and says\nYou know he's not going to be the first to use nuclear weapons even though you know there is a strategy called escalate to de escalate which is in their twenties Fifteen doctrine that in fact they might use a tactical nuclear weapons which is\nYou know why the U.S Congress or in the national defense authorization act twenty Nineteen now wants to fund a new counter to\nAh that to provide us a tactical capability in Europe so you've got all these kind of flattering around there I I Would say right now because of the capabilities that Russia is posing against NATO or and they\nOf course the more strategic capability that he's been modernizing with his platforms and his uh weapons or\nThat there that the mere threat in the long term threatened and especially if they collaborate as they are as I pointed out earlier with defense ministers consistently meeting and you mentioned the Vostok now twenty eight team\nJoined exercise which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts served indicators and demonstrate that these two nations are you\nScience which is going to be an annual exercise these sorts served indicators and demonstrate that these two nations are pushing back against the former dominance that we had across the world and arguably you know you can\nCome up with the conclusion I think that perhaps were not as dominant perhaps we are weakening or certainly up until the ah the Trump Administration came in and started to refuel our defense industry\nA and our Pentagon to have capabilities that we were really bleeding a and therefore we're not able to stand toe to toe with the rising Chinese\nMilitary and of course though not as big as the former Soviet Union the Russians have capabilities that clearly we don't have and we're trying to catch up with even now\nLet me ask you about NATO article five course the cornerstone of the the North Atlantic Treaty Organization an attack on one member of NATO was an attack on all of its members should we really go to war with Russia if let's say they roll tanks across the stony in border we want to go to war maybe World War three over in stone yeah\nWell that's a that's why you know Trump has been over there you know of trying to shake them up saying you've got to spend more and yeah you know even the idea of accepting Macedonia we already have twenty nine members do we need all these other little countries\nYou know might Russia or go in and and and disturbed that country and then as you're right we could clear article five and we have to go to war now there's only been one of the declaration of course that was two thousand and one when we were attacked a\nYou know in New York and Washington and Pennsylvania and and the like can we declared war on terror and we're all over the place to include Afghanistan et cetera so [noise]\nUm no I I don't think that we should you know jump at that and I think that's what is in the back of Trump's mind says you know I'm not sure I Want to throw my entire nation's capability and wealth and and statue in future into the hands of these little tiny nations need that may not have\nThe wherewithal not only to push back against the Russians but to ah you know make these tough decisions so\nThat I think is very much on the forefront that's what John Bolton perhaps is going to talk to his counterpart in the Kremlin next week\nYou know certainly you know the defense ministers are are talking that I Know the general Dunford was just over at his counterparts and NATO and\nAnd he was saying look you folks you've got to wake up and he said yeah they are waking up to the threat posed by Russia [noise] uh but we as a nation you certainly the United states\nYou know had better make it very clear that if if we can't back a an article five declaration by even one of these little tiny countries that are threatened Lithuania Estonia or even\nPollen which is a you know really\nA very concerned about the Russian Bear and what they might do perhaps similar to what they did with Ukraine these are all issues of\nGreat uh you know magnitude that um we've got to decide and thus far we haven't back out on a NATO but perhaps that's something we need to rethink\nLet's talk about China um we've been hearing all about Russian collusion in elections and so forth are Nikki Haley the UN ambassador and the president has accused\nThe Chinese of of meddling in the mid mid term elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states um\nFrom elections uh there's obviously a huge amount of economic integration with China in the United states I'm the big concern as I see it again comes back to cyber warfare and all these talks about\nA Chinese made computer chips in components in electronics they may have a back door\nOr even in US military equipment talked me about the series the seriousness of that ...\nWell it is a very serious threat in fact over the last year and certainly at the Pentagon you know the\nA defense secretary Jim Mattis uh put out a mandate say look you know even in these Chinese made phones you know ... you were not going to sell them in our\nIn our post exchanges are ... you know our our stores are we're not going to buy certain items because we're

future war world to that well\nYou know we have that alliance and to keep in mind I have no doubt that the Russians and the Chinese\nAre just you know very tight now out of necessity\nDon't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them\nThe Chinese are just you know very tight now out of necessity\nThey don't want to be contained by us and I don't know that we can contain them but they want to form their own little alliance and to a certain degree of his belt and road strategy of president Xi around the world and collaboration with the Russians in\nMilitary exercises this is all painting a picture where you can see a divided world emerging a so to abandon NATO even though it has all sorts of you know warts and problems with it at this point might not be well advised\nBut certainly allowing turkey into our secrets into our systems with a Russian made air defense system is not a good idea you\nKnow far for me to to um stand up for the house of Saud by\nA given that so much of the narrative of the show the\nMurder has come from the Turks and also cutter or another sort of sworn enemy of Saudi Arabia is it possible do you think there's anything to the the idea that that cutter turkey are trying to\nDrive a wedge between the United states and uh there's there are their allies the Saudis with is\nOf course you know that's a sort of thing that you know\nKind of the poker and the Internet geo political world that takes place all the time behind the scenes you know who were the people that were in the\nYou know the Saudi embassy that night uh I suppose some details will eventually come out with the clandestine type of operations no one nation to another or perhaps not nation states but other activities\nTake place unfortunately all the time you know we're in a tight spot what can President Trump do he can sanction entities and individuals\nOr even if the ... the show was you know demonstrated to have been murdered as it would appear to be by a Hinch men that were under the\nLeadership of saw him on don't know but that could be clearly we could cancel the arms deal but I mean we've been not only a hundred and ten billion it's far in excess of that and we have a lot of people on the ground working hand in glove with him but we risk a relationship\nWith a with the Saudis against Iran and of course the Saudis interestingly are aligned with Pakistan Pakistan has nuclear weapons\nUm and the packs of course distance from us now aligned with the Chinese so you you've got to look at second and third order effects of any decision geopolitically in that part of the world\nOr otherwise you end up with no one that you can go to and work with a given your your vested interests and of course the the Yemen situation we've been helping them a great deal the rea Riyadh government\nAnd trying to battle the who tease others of course the Iranians you know through proxies in that part of the world um I Wish it were simple it's not simple uh the world's divided\nAnd of course as we see is what I call the\nAlliance of evil Russia and China you using the mechanisms behind the scenes through a variety of proxies not just the north Koreans in the uranium but others\nI think are a era one is going to be one of those proxies to a certain degree even though he would like to think that he can rule the the Muslim world um I think the Chinese have a better idea for him\nA ... if you were in John Bolton supposition or you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what\nRight here for him a ... if you were in John Bolton supposition you had the president's ear who knows maybe you do or what would you be advising how how is this how do we counteract this how do we step back from the brink of of war\nWell I I Do believe that a boat and we will talk to his counterpart about uh you know renewing new start which expires in twenty Twenty one well we've got to do that or it's neither country's best interest to not have a an agreement that isn't for civil the problem is\nAnd the Russians notice that um Nineteen eighty seven I N F treaty was ah was violated or with their own cruise missiles\nAnd uh you know they probably will admit that behind the scenes or you know we've done a lot of in the open a so I think that will will get something I Know that\nYou know they had was from Trump asked for you met with putting in Helsinki in July but yeah they did talk about that issue and potent surreal is you know yeah he he has grandiose ideas\nAbout the fact that he can meet with the world leader ah on the west Trump you know in the eyes of the the Russian people means that they are great power again and of course you know putting his meetings with President Xi on a frequent basis\nJust solidifies that viewpoint so if I were both ... and I ... you know I I've I've talked to John Bolton before and so I ...\nI kind of have a sense that that's what he's going to do you know he he's a real pragmatist he is a tough guy\nBut he does have the president's year and I think that that's it that's going to be the top of the agenda and of course uh he'll probably try to deal with\nThe issues in Syria um and with Aaron Rowe on a course a uranium the Iranians are our problem for Israel\nUh we we have no question I think after Netanyahu revealed months ago you know those volumes and volumes of evidence regarding their nuclear programs\nYou know we don't acknowledge it a lot of things but I suspect that uh you know there's good reason to believe the Iranians are up there is no good\nOr is there were to be regime regime change in in Iran and and hopefully that'll come about by the Iranian people are just getting fed up with the situation with you and chasing the mullahs out of there if Iran were to become a secular\nNon align nation or you know again leaning to the west as they did for many many decades\nHow would that change the situation because obviously what's going on in Syria is it's not about a civil war it's about a proxy war and it's about Iran so if Iran has regime change how does that change the equation\nWell if you don't have the ayatollah running you know the you know the military and their diplomacy or you\nKnow to promote their their sheer world view a and the autocratic world view of of the removal of when I I think that you find that they're not involved with the Hutus are not involved with\nAssad a there are less involved with Russia accept because of economic interests and perhaps even to a certain degree with China um [noise] and it's\nProblem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia you know Riyadh into Iran is going to continue\nThe problem is the age old tension between the Sunni and Shia Riyadh and Iran is going to continue um but it it if you're not involved and you know in fueling terrorism such as his law and\nYeah southern Lebanon and you know encouraging him off and\nYou know Palestine and so forth and you know we'll have an easier way in that part of the world we can we can work with them or the Iranians are wonderful people are very bright capable Persian people and they have a long history I Would hope that they will\nReplace their autocrats with people that are have a a more a better sense of history and were\nWere they ought to be going a but we're not going to eliminate all the tension unfortunately\nWell another followed from that are positive aspect of that might be a liberalizing Saudi Arabia because before the Iranian Revolution I think Saudi Arabia was far more liberal but the habits were sort of seen as a counter measures to the she influenced so maybe we'll see\nTV grown past us ... dot com and download the UFO Dee Dee absolutely and I do go to us ...\nAnd who who Amazon apple groomed us ...

D\n\nLieutenant colonel Robert McGinnis is with us before we go to the phones are Bob let me ask you the last three years well projecting into next year the Trump Administration is earmarked proximate lead to point to a to point three billion dollars increase defense spending we had\nSeven hundred and sixty billion a couple of years ago seven hundred and five I think last year in another seven hundred coming up this year ah it is is that enough I mean a lot of that obviously is going to salaries and so forth but is it enough\nYou know half of it you're right does go to the salaries and that's why people often say well gosh\nYou know you know how can the Russians and the Chinese be such an adversary and in competitive with us while they hide most of what they're spending on their own national security you know the answer is uh we'll see\nUm the concern is here this past week the president came and said we're going to all parts of the U.S government must ... five percent well we went through this ... quest ration period in which had just crippled our readiness our ability to go out and trained to be ready to fight\nTo replace you know with your new aircraft for these\nAntiques that we're trying to fly around the world the same thing was ships you know it's an incredibly expensive\nTo have an armed forces and you know it reminded me of of something that a Ronald Reagan said you know and this was you know obviously a few years ago and basically says that\nIf you want to be free you have to be willing basically to pay the price and the price in this case is to have a modern armed forces nobody's going to seek to contest well today we're being contested a seriously on all fronts by\nA both China and Russia especially combined as they're forming a new alliance and so if we sustain as you know the chiefs of staff and the and the chairman of the joint chiefs General Joe Dunford if we don't sustain heavy investment in long term capabilities\nUh then we're going to fall behind were already falling behind in terms of hyper sonics in artificial intelligence or even in an investment in our our blue water navy uh\nUh the last couple of years have been great it's only putting it on our rights glide path if we can sustain it\nLet's say a say hello to the west of the Rockies in Las Vegas good evening good morning Steve welcome to coast to coast am\nThank you very much a Robert you were talking about the uh Chinese tapping our electronics for information or I'm really concerned about is what if the Chinese have programmed to an end date into all of these electronic chips\nSo that everything shuts down at the same time some time in the future\nYou know it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen\nYou know it's it sounds a little paranoid but I think it's very feasible and that's really a something major that could happen quick question Steve is that possible Bob\nWell I'm not an electronics uh no expert however I Do understand the question and I share that concern a and that's something that I think that the Jim Mattis our defense\nSecretary a is concerned about that\nThings like that could undermine the complexity of our systems and if we get a programmable and reversible inundated\nElectronics aboard our satellites or missiles or aircraft\nCarrier ships and it's and so forth and we\nCould find that this could be catastrophic so you know I I think there's plenty of caution today a there's a wakeup call across a certainly the U.S military and I think our allies are are joining that understanding that uh this is a very new world that we're facing\nAnd we have to be very careful of\nOf the type of equipment that we do embrace and so this is I don't think it's out of the possibility\nIt it reminds me of um what's your ... um the U.S spy plane that held in ... was held in China for some time uh I think it was maybe a near collision involved and and I'm\nI'm I'm Wondering if that that might be what we're talking about here perhaps it was ... it was ... it landed there because of being hacked into somehow\nYou know well you know that's the sort of thing that we are very concerned about a cyber the battleground of cyber as a woman before then I point out an alliance of evil and\nGo into great detail is two and not only the threat of taking down our own infrastructure a hacking into our elections and doing all sorts of things that we hear about every day and this is an existential threat to us and in fact when you look at the\nPresident's strategy and he says that there's\nA there's a possibility that we would respond to\nA cyber attack a with a nuclear weapon that's how serious it is today a and yet you know there's so much we don't know so you know could somewhat take on an aircraft could take down a satellite takedown of\nLos Angeles I think all that is possible or if we don't put fire walls and the capabilities to prevent this in place\nOne card line Don is in Kent, Ohio John good evening good morning welcome to coast\nBrother Robert happy Sabbath a and lieutenant colonel I I really appreciate your service your patriotism and you're with them during the meanings that you have do they ever consider the Bible prophecy of Daniel eight where America will attack Iran and destroy it\n[noise]\nHave to remind me of ... and Daniel late where you're looking at dawn I'm you know I I understand perhaps where you're coming from a you know I I don't know that that's something that we would do unless we perceive that the threat was a against\nYou know our key allies and against our interest in those five it claims that you know did he go from the west will come upon the whole face ... years of all not touch the ground\nAnd it will destroy the ram that has the two horns of the the ladder on is the bigger on that comes up last in the first one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last one\nThe two wars of the the latter one is the bigger ... that comes up last them the\nFirst one would be Iraq that's already been conquered but the last one that comes up will be destroyed and claimed that no one will help it says that you know a a nation that comes from the west will not touch the ground which means it's going to be unable or an air force\nAttack or Iran is you know a huge country and that and um but it's also states that no one will come to her aid\nOr and I find that kind of interesting since it has you know alliances with the actual North Korea China and uh uh Russia\nAh so you know it's a and this was a dual application prophecy also uh I Know Alexander the great a competent but he did not use\nOr anything but an infantry a probably a column a hundred and some yards wide they're not covered the whole earth as or explain to you know this prophecy so ah and actually it also mentions that he goes I'm from the west will have her\nOr has the wing husband eagle\nAnd those wings will be plugged in I have to stand up as a man so uh I didn't know if the joint chiefs are considered any of those biblical prophecies in their uh\nUh you know summation of this whole incident over their\nGreat question John Bob Let's say you\nKnow I I understand you know we're done it's coming from the eagles certainly you know we like to think of as the United states and its\nIts use elsewhere even in revelation\nOr the possibility of interpreting and like that you know I I tend to you know of shy away from\nA uses Jesus and and going more in the direction of extra Jesus in terms of you know what's the context of that particular scripture [noise] I have not studied Daniel aid to the degree that Don or would\nYou know benefit from an analysis of that so I I really can't answer the question though I Would say that yeah it's not my experience that our chiefs of the armed forces\nAre terribly a biblical illiterate and therefore are in tune with a Bible prophecy I'm not that they shouldn't be but I just don't get the sense that they are and certainly the material I read doesn't suggest that they have\nA Susan is on the wild card lining

sixteen in the Bible people have yes and yet\nPeople painted drunk three sixteen on his eye patch is three years before that game when ... when he won the BCS championship game against Oklahoma\nSo three years to the day he he played the Steelers he had the halo showed up at John three sixteen and passing three sixteen yards thirty one point six average per catch even CBS carry the game the rating for the game was thirty one point six percent\nWas the highest rating again God for the game but\nI remember right now as they were kind of position thirty one minutes and seconds the only

much for being here it's a terrific to have everybody along with me tonight as I see some myself where just inexpensively stops working\nYou know it's kind of interesting when you are investing all the high tech gear and then it just doesn't want to work in any way we get a great show wind up for you tonight um it's actually going to be the show with David [laughter]\nYou know that means necessarily under that we've got to get on the program and they're both named\nDavid ... the first guess we're going to have automatic very very excited about while I'm excited about both frankly but the first one I'm just kind of out of our normal uh topics of discussion but the Halloween season I think it's very very appropriate and we're going to have like David Howard sport and join us in the first hour of the program\nBut since it's the Halloween season I think it's very very appropriate and we're going to have like David Howard sort and join us in the first hour of the program\nHe is I'm an actor and\nHe is best known for a movie that came out relatively recently called Tara fire it's on Netflix right now I Know that 'cause that's where I saw it\nAnd um he plays a character called art the clown I'm art the clown made its debut that character made its debut in a a movie called all Hallows eve which was a series of three short films and which are the clown I'm kind of this is the thread between the three\nAnd a\nBut his feature film or what's called Tara fire and it was a really really good fun slasher kind of movie it's not for those who weren't\nA ... into Gore and I'm not a big Gore movie fan in fact that stuff kind of turns me off but this was tastefully done it didn't have an ... an excessive amount of Gore in it yet it had enough that made it interesting and the way it was done\nYou know with a full head of steam heading a right to Halloween here I mean it's just I I last night I knew it will like we're in January it just became twenty Eighteen and I was trying to scratch my head to how it can be twenty Eighteen already and now we're\nWe're into the ... the fourth quarter of the year and uh we're talking about Halloween and soon it'll be Christmas and then it'll be another New Years and then I'll be saying what the heck how to get into twenty Nineteen that's how stuff roles\nBut as a refers to Halloween\nI'm as you as most of you know any way I I'm not just the the host of your radio program here I'm I'm also a horror film fanatic\nAnd to the point where I created a convention a horror film convention called scare a con which is in its ninth year talking about time flying and we've got two locations we've got one coming up here at the end of the month in upstate New York near Syracuse attorneys don't casino the other one's held in Framingham, Massachusetts in June\nBut anyway so I keep my eye on the horror film community when there are new films out and I try to catch as many as I can now I'm not one of these guys that goes to to the theater very often because first of all where I live in Cooperstown there is no theater I've traveled forty minutes to get to a movie theater plus\nI kinda prefer to watch these things in the comfort\nOf my home in a in my comfortable chair with my uh you know comfortable snack of choice and uh you know whatever I feel like if I Want to posit that can pause it and whatever so um you know I prefer to watch these things at home so I'm kinda relegated to waiting until they are available on some type of video on demand option and\nI happened to be scanning through a those options not too long ago maybe two weeks ago and I stumbled across the film on Netflix called Tara fire\nAnd ah I'm not generally one for scary clown movies um you know and I wasn't a big fan of it\nOr there's been some others I I saw one or two along the way that kind of were interesting to me but this one just caught my eye for some reason so I watched it\nAnd are at the end of the film um it was one of the few films where I actually thought jeeze I Want to watch that again and the more are the days went by after I saw Tara fire I started to think about it and in kind of consider it\nAnd I did go back and watch it again and it was the performance of my next guest David Howard forton as art the clown that made this\nMovie so hunting him ... it's the kind of film that sticks with you it's it's got some board it's got a lot of tension um they're very few characters in the whole movie um but they're good characters but it's this portrayal of art the clown\nThat makes it a haunting films so a David welcome to be on reality radio I'm so honored that you you ah took the time to be with us here today\nBob thanks for having me [laughter]\nYou know you're laughing now the funny thing is um before we set up this interview I didn't know if you could speak or not because in the film a share of fire you do not say a word\nNo one found [laughter]\nAnd that makes them rising lines a lot easier I suppose\nOh it's so much on your ... I Would just be in the chair and I like Damien what am I doing today is like oh yeah you're straying away this girl and then they're going to stab so I'm like OK cool that was that\nYou know for anybody who's seen the film they are going to know what I'm Talking about when I asked this next question but um you know it takes\nA lot for somebody to be a good actor and ... and and it takes a lot for somebody to be a good actor when they can use of dialogue to a moat it there's something there's a whole nother level of acting that comes into play when you can't use your voice and you can't ...\nWhen they can use dialogue to a moat it there's something there's a whole nother level of acting that comes into play when you can't use your voice and you can't use words to convey emotion or to remote on screen 'em you did that phenomenally how did how did you think you put yourself in the head space to be able to do that\nOh gosh I mean I just basically I I have a huge like data base in my brain of like silent\nFilm actors I grew up watching a lot of the old silent films like Keaton and Chaplin and like you know Marx Brothers especially you know I Love horrible a lot and I'm like\nI Can't even think of like um art is basically like Freddie Krueger an ... an Harpo Marx had a child [laughter] and that's what would come out and start the clown\nAnd that's really you interview you know it's interesting you say that because I happen to be huge Marx Brothers fan myself and I was gonna ask you is ah Harpo Marx who anybody's familiar with the Marx Brothers no he doesn't speak a line in any of their films and he plays everything pantomime and it was going in there was any influence there\nOh definitely I mean I I think there's a lot I mean he's got the hat he's got the orange juice you know he's a he's a lot like Harpo Harpo was always the mischief maker too you know so it's just like yeah [laughter] I don't know how to play the heart so so you will never see\nOr play the heart [laughter]\nSo what what was it a fund soon to make was it a difficult seemed to me what was the experience like\nIt was it was it was a little bit of both I Would say more on the fund side though I mean we we had you know you're you're a little bit of setbacks you were there you know or want to happen especially with like you know low budget films so\nBut we had a lot of fun making this there was a lot of just you know silly shenanigans happening on set you know anytime the cameras stop rolling I think you know we tried to keep things light and\nYou know fun you know the ... you know the you know a counterbalance all the crazy stuff we're actually doing on camera so [laughter]\nIt was definitely it was definitely a challenge though you know having to tackle a character that does not speak at all [laughter]\nYeah well that's going to be very very difficult and you know having to take a peek at your IMDB page and it was this your first speech wing so\nThis was this is my first I primarily done a bunch of theater and like some voiceover work I don't even have all my voice over stuff up there on a I N D be yet but yeah it's just this is my first foray into film and I I loved it [laughter] how did you get to rule hundred network in for you\nIt ... happened because the original actor that played um art and the original film all Hallows eve didn't want to come back he retired from acting\nAnd the head also previously cast an actor to play art when they did a teaser trailer for Tara fire and he ended up not wanting to do the role because he didn't like putting the contacts in\nOh so just serendipitously\nHappened that you know I I found this\nThis posting on line on a actors access which is a a website for actors for auditions\nAnd I at that point I was without a job or anything like that I had just come back from touring and now it's taking a few months off just you know auditioning and I came across as ad looking for a tall skinny guy that had clowning or physical comedy experience for the quote unquote role of a lifetime\nAnd I jumped out of it 'cause I was already familiar with the character of art anyway from all Hallows eve so I was like oh my God yes I have to play this character so eye contact my reps and they sent me an and the rest is history\nI was going to ask you if you had a number two if you're familiar with the character before you took the role knowing that or to clone made his appearance in that uh I guess there was a trilogy of shorts an article on this was the character and I haven't seen it but it was a character that kind of was the thread through the whole thing\nOr the clown made his appearance in that uh I guess there was a trilogy of shorts an article on this was the character and I haven't seen it but it was a character that kind of was the thread through the whole thing\n[noise] yes yes you are but he still wasn't even really the main character he was just like something like the fans go on down to they really liked them because you know it's it's an interesting looking character he's a very interesting character and stuff that he's very unique\nAnd I think because of that the fans really demanded his own movie and so that's why they decided to make one oh I'm Glad that apple\nYeah I can understand why you know I'm a ... or you generally a horror movie fan to begin with because I I Know a lot of people end up in horror films aren't uh where do you find the yeah\nI I Am I Am I was a little bit late to the game I didn't really get into horror films until like my senior high school and scream to came out I got dragged to that by a bunch of my friends and I loved it and after that I went ... when I went to college I my roommate chat and I we would\nOn the weekends we would go to the movie gallery and just read the whole stack of like horror films in just watch them over the weekend in just marathon those things and it was so much while we were both the\nBoth of us are just catching up on last time so we were like where you have to [laughter] do this I actually saw him like two weeks ago my school reunion and we're talking about that was like yeah dude you know it's because of this is kind of like where I got a lot of fresh produce a good thing we did that back in college [laughter]\nYeah yeah that always helps um oh we're going to take a break here in just a minute I'm going to keep you for a few minutes after the break you know and I'm going to take a few phone calls to we've got some people don't ask a question too\nUm but but you know there is one scene in the film and I think you may have heard my intro into the discussion I'm not much of a Gore fan I mean you know I I think Gore is a substitution for horror and many in many ways it's it's not scary it's just turn off\nTo me personally there are other people that swear by that is the the horror of their choice and I can understand why it might be\nUm but this particular film had Gore I mean there's some serious war but it wasn't a you know excessive it wasn't Gore for the sake of Gore and almost felt to me is do you know it it it fit in the story that was being told 'em right there is one scene a which I won't spoil it for anybody who hasn't seen it but it was ... it was\nPretty hard to watch and I'm just saw it in a young lady um but my point in talking about it\nIs that I Can't remember what the music was playing behind it and you know and and you're doing the sign and you've got this clown face laughter thing going on looking back at the at the other young lady who was tied up in a chair\nAnd that was to me almost the most haunting a thirty seconds of the entire film you know what I'm Talking about\nOh I Know exactly what you're talking about [laughter] that was what was going through your mind as you were doing that\nOh I ... it was so cold in that room and I was you know I felt so sorry for a poor Catherine some more of this was just like you know let's let's get through this [laughter]\nWhat is the timing of terror fires release in any way ah associated with the fact that maybe now there's more interest in it demon killer clowns or is that just went on and all\nThat was we actually I'm a ... I I first audition for terrified back in April twenty Fifteen before they even and I think that's even before they announce that they were making it so like\nWe I think they're in the process of casting or something like that when we were already filming terrified we started filming in October of twenty Fifteen so yeah\nThey just you know since they're big Hollywood studio they're able to make movies a lot faster than we were\nWe had some minor setback so [laughter]\nRight well I I promised I wouldn't keep you very long so you just a couple more questions and one has a new kind of addressed it already I was going to throw out the question to Wendy's assuming on the sequel start but you guys are obviously talking about that\nYeah we're definitely talking about um damons in the process of writing it right now so I'm a ... once you finish writing it we're going to [noise]\nYou know start trying to shop at the studios because we we definitely want to have a much bigger budget for the sequel because you know we had such a small budget for this for terrifying we pulled off amazing things with that but the ideas that we have for the sequel\nWe need a larger budget so we're we're hoping to get you know studio backing and once we get that we want to you know I think we'll start filming pretty soon after that I Would hope what was the budget for the first one\nOh [laughter] I don't know if I'm allowed to say but it's probably much much lower than you think it was it was basically and fight the five figure\nArea that well it's it's I mean you\nIf I'm allowed to say but it's probably much much lower than you think it was it was basically and fight the five figure area\nThat well it's it's I mean you you ah do you mean the you know everybody involved that it did a tremendous job with what you had to work with and I wouldn't even have any I wouldn't I didn't look watching that film thinking to myself they were held back by a budget in any way I never I never thought that I'm a little bit involved in this business so I Would uh you know that's something I I tend to say once in awhile\nYes it is the true test them and they're you know the the crew and the cat that were involved with it and we all just you know put our hearts into this and you know and it's the troops estimate especially Damien talents I mean he he I think what saved a lot of money was him doing the practical effects themself you didn't have to hire anybody else to do that\nUm would you say that uh aren't the clown has the potential to climb the ladder of a horror film ... and maybe a you know stand in the plant to plant so close to maybe on the same level but close to like the Michael Meyers of the world than the uh you know Freddie Krueger isn't\nYou know the ... and you know the villains that we've we've known for Thirty years now\nI I sure hope so I mean I think he does personally I think he does because those all those characters going even back to Dracula Lugosi and all those you know I'm\nCarl off all those guys that the characters they played back then and there the characters from the seventies and eighties especially all those characters are very interesting they they had charisma there was something you like watching about them and I think that you know art has a lot about him that\nPulls people in as well and he's got a lot of personality and there's there's a lot more going on with them that you know you know yet as well so\nI Believe that he could I I think it's you know we're about says I Am hoping that our film is going to bring in a new age a slasher films again\nAll right I have to ... I've got to ask you this question as well because um you know throughout the entire film you see are the clown you um assume he's just a clown you know obviously you need one but he's a clown but at the very end there's a bit of a twist it makes you think hey there's some supernatural something going on here\nIs there are natural components aren't the clown\nThere is definitely a supernatural component it that's why we put that little bit in there because even the uh if you go back and watch all Hallows eve there are some supernatural stuff that happens in there as well so you know we definitely want to go dig into more of that in the future fail and so I I look at this ... this is you know\nWhat happens at the end of terror fires the wake of who are really is\nAnd I see intro yeah so you get news channels like that that's what you're going to do\nYeah yeah we're going to build [laughter] very uh\nIf people want to follow your work David they want to keep track of what's going on it do you have a anything on social media or anything that you point people do\nSure I I usually just say go to like my um Instagram or a Twitter pages I'm a I'm under David Howard ... David H Thornton ... different variations of that I guess I Can't remember all of them [laughter]\nI usually post things on there as well just to keep people updated on everything so yeah\nWell you know again I really really appreciate you joining us tonight it was kind of last minute but with Halloween coming up one last question if you had to pick one or two movies that aren't terrified because I've already recommended that one for people to watch as we enter the hall Halloween season what would you recommend for people what are your favorite\n... like ... or ... or a oh boy [laughter]\nThere's so many um I one of my personal favorites is nightmare before Christmas I just love that film [noise] um and I would say\nThere are so many um I one of my personal favorites is nightmare before Christmas I just love that film um and I would say also go in just a boy\n[laughter] I Know I should have ... or ... that I was going to have that yeah that's a\nGood one that's a good one um I I I really enjoy trick or treat ... I think that the really fun film is a good anthology film and it has so many great little hall like horror Halloween this type of stores all tied together so\nI I thought that was a fun though right that is one of the doesn't get much of a lot right\nHey thanks so much for being with us good luck to them as you all you and your team a start planning and working on a the sequel to tear fire and hope will have you back on the show some time\nOh I thank you very much for having me All right great\nOkay take care of a great Halloween David Howard ... and ... in the movie is Tara fire look it up on Netflix it's a great it's a great watch you know specially Halloween season where to take a break when we come back we'll bring our next guest in David Mak will be joining us he is in New York Times best selling author be talking about\nHis series of novels are that are called the dark arts series which is a fantasy Secret History series\nSeries and we're also talked about or his Star Trek novels has written a number of them as well to be on reality radio on Jimmy Johnson thanks for being here\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] Mm [noise] Mm\nMine knows that [noise] you know when you\nWhen the moon and back again and again you can do [noise]\n\nResults may vary noticed solicitation for news was long eight forty eight percent payroll taxes where I'm not filed you return the IRS will get you they can pick your property take you to poor even put you in jail with one call to wall you'll never need to talk to the IRS again our average\nClients' homes for about ten percent of what his old we offer free face to face consultations in your local area all eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three that's eight hundred Seventy seven zero for three three\nThursday Night Football\nEvery source of prime time or in a film that's worth player [noise]\nThursday Night Football when it's going off\nThe NFL Network from video blackout\nFor calling consolidated credit counseling services can I help you I sure hope so I mean that is a credit card bills I actually credit cards that are making minimum payments on another and then I'm behind on about five thousand dollar slid interest rates he's hanging between Eighteen and twenty two percent that rape it'll take over Twenty years Twenty years working scientists\nWell interest rates he's hanging between Eighteen and twenty two at that rate it'll take over Twenty years Twenty years that consolidated credit can do is work with your credit at Columbia entertainment and reduce or even eliminate your interest charge that he should be able to pay everything off in three or four years what do I have to get some details and getting ready to celebrate your freedom from\nGang we're consolidated credits we're here to give you freedom from going out for your free consultation known it was this easy I Would have called years ago\nOnly children by two sixty seven fifty eight hundred sixty seven fifty eight hundred five five do sixty seven fifty\nServices in pretty good he's a Muslim or something like before they're more than ... remembering none of them from my department of unanswered about the middle of the MIT we're going to make deals you go through one way says why they were just they originally commissioned license number D.C thirty to\nThe all new radio dot map is available now it's a totally new experienced it puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get their news and information you rely on even when you are an arrow radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone now", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "20"}
