All right so enter George Nouri tonight who's a getting a good weekend off I Hope and doing something fun and it in in this period just before Halloween ... is our focus for both tonight and tomorrow night when I'll be hosting coast to coast again coming up tomorrow night\nLooking forward to a season with the which it's a in our first hour we'll talk about\n... story you could ever imagine to here on a Saturday Night before Halloween because it's all true and also happens to be a written by a guy named Bill James ... some of the butter no as a sportswriter he writes ah he follows the Boston Red Sox and he writes about the ... he was not in he's not in LA tonight\n... originally we had um scheduled I'm Bill James for tomorrow night on with the contingency that if the Boston Red Sox made the world series you may not be able to make it but as it turns out\nHe wasn't traveling to LA so he's going to finish in after all which is great because in the tradition of like you know Freddie and Jason and Michael and all of the Halloween stuff um it's a creepy story and you're going to want to hear it coming up tomorrow night\nOn coast to coast but it won't be any better than tonight will do open lines later on we'll tell you some of the subjects will get to\nBetween genetic engineering and artificial intelligence robot man I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really is\nMan I'm telling you Larry King is going to be around for a long long\nAnd I was reading some of those sanctions and I thought that was interesting because there really as you said when he was very I think you mentioned like ... once the book and there's not as big emphasis on it\nBut there is still this hope that people have about preserving their actions and and then that becomes a course a full debate about what we're is the key to the essence of us you know we used to think the soul was the heart and the head contained all of the you know the the computer works but\nBut you do you how realistic is it ever in any near future that we would be able to load\nThoughts in dreams like you might expect from Minority Report being able to capture them and then put them into something else\n[noise] I think it's very real or in I mean you know and and and you indicated about the my book being about the future but but the truth of it is it it's really about what's going on right here and right now even as we speak in ... in labs all over the world\nUh I tell for example the story of Ilan mosque or being very very involved well you know he's involved in driverless cars he's involved in outer space and going to Mars and so forth and so on but he's also\nGot a finger in this whole neural net a business is the really the new one of the new hot topics out their\nImagine a ... and ... and ... imagine that because we're already doing it with mice and in in the very near future um you know it it's pretty certain that we are going to be doing it with humans but imagine this un jak\nReally what amounts to a very fine fisherman's net think of it I think of it as a fisherman snapped so you injected into\nThe brain cavity of mouse and when you do that it's almost like tossing out a fishing net it wrapped itself around the brain\nAnd then kind of a integrate itself into the brain tissue and so it becomes one with a brain tissue and this neural net has a lead a electrical lead a coming out of it\nAnd the idea is that now we have a mechanism we have a real honest to goodness mechanism by which\nI'm we can tap into the human mind and plug it into let's say the Internet so one of the things that he alone mosque is thinking about doing and by the way you don't even have to have a lead you could have a wireless connection that that's even better\nBut one of the one of the things that Iran must get foreseen is a day when we ... with the use of one of these more on that\nWe can actually surf the Internet with our thoughts we don't need a key word or anything like that so I think that is the beginning of the of of the mechanism we can use to upload our thoughts are memories\nAre in code them digitally um it's not at all farfetched anymore once you had that neural net you have a mechanism by which you can transfer digitize if you will our thoughts onto a super computer and you know\nQuantum computers are on the horizon and so you're talking about supercomputers quantum computers are going to be like whoa [laughter]\nWay way out there right and so easily easily a whole you know it's not just a ordinary flash drive I mean you can hold on a of a person's entire a lifetime history of memories and then as I say robots are becoming very realistic we can talk about that\nTonight ... I I think\nThat's the way to go not cryogenic cryogenic says that kind of an old school I'm not saying that it's not going to be around it it will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and\nIt will be but I think these other technology is much more sexy and much more practical\nYou know and so and I'm not going to try and partially what'd you said to me it's been a ...\nI think it's fair to say and this is where I I think I draw maybe a different line than you do in this narrative moving forward\nIs when we use terms like thinking about doing or you know beginning of the mechanism that's what I'm Talking about when I see the future because what we can do now is the frontier but that's not where these are going into you know as we would say cilia logically\nThat's not the end game for where these things are and I think partly that's the scary peace because you know if we if we take our science fiction movies seriously then we're often reminded that starts off as a really good idea [laughter]\nCan go terribly wrong when it actually becomes applied science right\n... thank you thank you [laughter] absolutely oh no absolutely\nAnd and you're right there this book deals with\nWe're right at the cost in and I I think that's what makes it exciting but it also makes it in for some degree unsettling and and even downright dangerous that\nWe we are really at the threshold of these technologies ... are are kind of one foot in the present and one foot in the immediate future and so you're right you know it it enables or\nIf you will to make very accurate forecast in other words we're not talking about in the sky want you know the sweet bind by one day no these are things that are now becoming realize and so we can have this kind of discussion about\nHey what what kind of world are we creating what what is ... is a mortality in any sense of the word now possible\nAnd the short answer is yes it is very much so now that we have\nA ... that we are creating these incredible robots artificial intelligence that we have the ability to manipulate DNA now at will so so yes you're absolutely right that what we're discussing is the near future but it is it's it's enabling right now it's it's crazy\nWell and so I'm reminded of the of the ... song um which I I inevitably come back to an subjects like this um history shows again and again how nature points up the folly of men Godzilla and and the the the\nI think this is where and I'm sort of curious about your approach on this because this book is published by a a publishing company which is known for being state based\nAnd and I think this is in in in the in the certainly in the publicity for the book but even as you get into there's a larger discussion of\nNot just doing things because we can but because we should do and the arts are really important in there too so you know just because we're on the threshold of doing something off we do that and ... who how are we going to make a decision\nOn the implications of when we decide yep this is where we're going with this\nYeah you're you're right about regular you know when they approached me to write this book and I have to give him credit it was their idea um and you know they said basically hey you know you you really love writing about science history and\nI Do I Love science history because of the lessons it teaches us about what we can do and what we can't do what we should do and what we shouldn't do [noise] um they said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you know a ripoff\nAnd what we shouldn't do [noise]\nThey said why don't why don't you write about you know what's going on right now you're you're uniquely qualified you've been reporting science all your life and I've thought about it and it was a kind of a no brainer I said you all do it and then they gave me the the freedom to kind of you know opine about this that\nI Am a because I'm a theoretical physicist and you know I I I'm very strict about things so I decided I was going to write a book and the four sections that that I described all fact based in their ... it's just like you know the old\nDragnet series you know the facts ma'am right Andrew\n... that's what I did with those four sections there more than a thousand foot notes that you can imagine\nOh no ... I read through to you you're very young you sound very thorough\nVery thorough but then I allowed myself that last final chapter and I thought you know I Can't just\nServe this stuff up to the reader without giving them my thoughts on it and so here here my thoughts in a nutshell apropos what you've asked me [noise] um\nI see these innovations as the fruits of human intelligence that really spectacular many of them are brilliant\nAre a lot of positive consequences I think will come out of this but then there are some things as I said that are a little unsettling and downright dangerous what I think we need now because we are at this threshold of\nCreating for ourselves a world that can either be grim or great\nAnd so I think one of the things that can help steer us one way or the other is to call upon the fruits of human spirituality\nOut for many many years I was pretty much an atheist and the sense that all I cared about was science I grew up in east LA with the dream of becoming a scientist since the second grade really\nAnd that dream took me to UCLA then on to Cornell where I got my PHD in physics math and astronomy and then as I said on the Harvard where I taught physics for about eight or nine years and so\nIt was during my grad school years at Cornell when I started asking myself how does this universe that I've been studying come to be and\nI explored into wisdom and Buddhism and ... a Islam and transcendental meditation and Judaism and finally um\nI met this girl this girl came into my life and she challenged me to read the Bible and I wasn't interested I was like five or not I I just thought it was just too familiar to prosaic\nBut anyway it's it changed it was a game changer for me I don't want to get into all of it it's so I became a man of faith faith I'm a\nChristian and I take my ... my face very very seriously and so when I say\nCalled national debt relief at eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six eight hundred six eight three forty five forty six\nOn second thought it's not okay the east coast to coast am want Che accent T. [noise]\nMichael Guillen former science reporter for ABC News on various shows and former instructor of physics at Harvard as well as the author and the new book is uh is is just great it's the end of life as we know it and just before we went into the break we were talking about\nThat that space in discussions of what we should didn't want to do which\nMight be better informed by discussions of morality as much as ethics and and you know I think even Michael when you were talking about\nAbout the idea of preserving physical life on this planet is like the weather that was through uploading a brain and putting it into something you know into a robot or something you know even that it makes me\nQuestion whether or not that's something we ought to be doing I mean what is what is the endgame for that what is the ultimate what's the end used for that um other than our own human vanity that we become immortal\n[noise] yeah I agree with you and and uh I think in another concern or in addition to that is that\nA lot of this technology that we're we're kind of ... we're talking about right now it's no longer speculative it's actually happening is very expensive um you know never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of the technology let let's talk about some of the technology that is\nUm you know ... and never mind trying to achieve immortality through some of this technology let's let's talk about some of the technology that is being used to let's say a I'm a help treat macular degeneration I'm going to just pick that as an example there is a good way in California\nRight there's a company in California that is a marketing a retinal implants for people who are have macular degeneration and their eyesight a going away\nAll that stuff costs you know upwards of a hundred thousand dollars or more and it's not covered by most insurance policy so a lot of the technology that that are aimed at improving our health Hansing our health enhancing our life achieving immortality is going to be available to the super rich\nAnd so you have to stop and wonder what is this going to do what what is this going to do to the dynamics of the society when you have a wealthy super wealthy people elites\nIf you will I'm able to to benefit from this and and the others are you know like being put out of business by robots and so I talk seriously about a ... in my book I talk seriously about the possibility\nOf there being a human revolution you know we often talk about in science fiction often picks\nYou know robots kind of rising up and revolting against humans and taking over the earth well you know that we can talk about that possibility but I think an even more real possibility the way this technology is shaping up right now is for people who have been kind of disenfranchised\nUm or marginalized by this technology will just be get fed up at some point and say you know this is enough is enough I mean we're we're taking and we're taking it as it\nBehind and and and and and we're not going to we're not going to take it anymore and so ... and and I it's interesting and I talk about in the book\nDoes ring or you know you talk like that do the people in Salem no use that kind of I mean really [laughter] I gotta I gotta you're really on a limb there you know and [laughter]\nYeah well I figured it's a late night show so\nI'm trying to get all your gun unknown okay\nBut you know nevermind regularly I got to worry about my wife you know side that the white you said was a much uh\n[laughter] but um but I talk about how a lot of these guys from Silicon Valley are actually are buying these what they're calling bug out houses they're buying houses in these remote places in the country and in the world\nOn the chance that you know when this stuff hits the fan there I go again but one of the stuff hits the fan they they want to be able to escape and this is a serious thing I Hope some I quote former Google engineers in a Google executive or a ... and others\nWho who say yeah you know a human revolution is a real possibility many of them are trying to avoid that possibility now by talking about the universal basic income\nBeen hanging on me and you listen I listen to lose this position because yes the idea of having a bug out house right yeah that's like I mean every every you know church of latter day saints person I Know has a has that philosophy\nRight it was in ... to ... yeah I Know lots of other people who practice that belief that doesn't that's not the named Jimmy although I understand your point\nI I'm more thinking about I I'm more reminded of of ah you know what Jeff Goldblum said in Jurassic Park when he said you know the dinosaurs had\nTheir chance right they're done they they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dining\nThey they they they they ... that was there a moment and the fact that bringing them back is is to reintroduce say living dinosaurs just because we can\nIs and the and the notion to that for example\nWhen you think about the the the wealthy elites as opposed to the intellectual elite sort of the physical elites or any other types of ways in which we the moral or leads any way we could you know a ... quantify society hit the wealthy elites aren't necessarily the best in anything except\nInheriting stuff you know some of them might have gotten it on their own but not all of whom\nAnd then if that becomes the ... the class that's perpetuated I Would say again they had their chance this ... ... it has\nTo there has to be a Darwinian element to that where somebody else is going to have to come along behind them or we turn into Illinois and more locks from age do you well time machine right\nMhm yes yes yes yeah no it it it's interesting ah by the way I interviewed Jeff Goldblum one this is just a funny aside when\nIn fact when Jurassic Park came out I was at ABC News and I had been in touch with the producers and they invited me to come to the big Hollywood premiere in the ... at the after party and Jeff bloom was there and\nA bunch of other guys and I went up to ... I said Jeff you know you're always like playing a scientist or not just in Jurassic Park but elsewhere and I said sure I I'm just curious I said you know I did you have an interest in science growing up or what he just\nNot it's just a job and you know he has the old I was at length this appointed and his answer I thought he was going to say oh yeah you know I majored in physics at\nCollege right now you know [laughter] but no job for him but yeah\nIt's interesting I I I Love you bringing that up in the dinosaurs had their chance [noise] it's really an indication of how the earth how the world works how the universe works\nDesigned would work is designed to work exactly yeah and\nYou know you know you're somebody's religious beliefs aside for a moment let's just talk like strictly science sure um ... what what we learn is that\nOh these species have a window of time in which they rise up and they flourish then they die out for whatever reason whether it's a meteor or whether it's a\nA temperature change or or it's a a rampant disease that ... that I'm In you know like the woolly mammoth saber tooth cats and so forth and so on\nA and the dinosaurs are and and one wonders as as as you contemplate these innovations that we're creating the ones that I describe in this book you can't help but wonder\nWhy are we doing here and then I think of what Arthur C Clarke once said and it's dark with me he said it remains to be proven that intelligence has any survival value\n[laughter] I don't know why\nYou know and you wonder are we like\nOutsmarting ourselves you know are we are we just being too clever by half with the stuff thinking that you know we're going to improve life the we're going to improve the human condition and in fact just the opposite happens we do ourselves in I mean that's a real possibility\nAnd and and you think of Jeff Goldblum said they had their chance maybe some some creature and the future we'll look back at us and say yeah\nOh yeah human beings they had their their chance\nNow he blew it well now\nNow here's an inch now let me bring up a little differently if there was a ... humans killed off\nYou know and now here's an age now let me she raised up a little differently if there was a ... humans killed off species they didn't die out naturally they were killed off\nAs opposed to say evolution they weren't they they weren't allowed to follow their evolutionary cycle that was truncated right by\nThe fact that they you know some giant bird and New Zealand lead these really big exit you know human could eat off for three days and so I mean there's going to so I mean I I realize you can make a Darwinian argument for that but I think there are some species like some\nLike some bare earth some tiger whenever that if we cloned that there and brought it back in ... introduced it to the wild not enough time has passed\nThat he couldn't read absorbed that back into the the natural flow of our evolutionary cycles\nAs a service offices just issue of these veterans have what they need to drive in their lives\nThe national foundation for credit counseling want you to know there is a veil of for whatever kind of a problem facing\nThe NFC see is a nonprofit organization with more than fifty years of bitter certified counselors in your area can help you took the first step in getting a grip on your finances\nAnd that can help create a personalized show you how to educated decisions about your financial future you are not alone let the NFC help get you started hold them at eight hundred three eight eight to two Senate or visit dead advice dot org that's eight hundred\nThree eight eight to to to seven or visit that advice that or this has been a public service from the NFC\nFrom the just the ... studios ... north Las Vegas ...

next hour we go to open lines cause it's friday\nGeorgia's got the night off I'm sitting in and uh and I want to get back to some of those go stories that are up the coast to coast am dot com so I'm giving you the heads up\nTo look for that story about the ghost that moves the jar\nYou can see the video it's it's in the carousel as we call it that you know the rotating stories at the top of the fold the website of coast to coast to the MTA come watch that before we get to open lines next door I'd love to hear your explanation for it if you think there's kind of a science the one\nYou get to the next hour in the meantime let's pick up this conversation about a about ... to about the idea of blending human physical animal life together um it's not just about splicing it's more than that we'll get to it next on coast to coast am this is Ian but it [noise]\nYeah well you know what I've been reporting on that story for some years now and um it began with a small number of scientists um\nWho experimented on monkeys and it gets a little grizzly but this being Halloween okay ah where they yeah they severed monkeys head and then they re attached it\nOr just to prove that they could so there's a lot of plumbing involved right I mean you have to show up the the the the veins in the arteries and the nerves and so forth and so on and they've they've tried to have achieved to a level of success with monkeys and so now embolden\nUh by that they are turning their attention to doing it to humans and there's at least one guy in Russia who has been quoted a frequently\nOr who is a quadriplegic a you know otherwise mentally very alert and he says yeah come and do it to me man I'm I'm ready I'm I Want to be that guinea pig and there are scientists who are her were quoted as saying yeah they're going to do it so\nWe're once again you know remember I'm I'm old enough to remember the first artificial heart transplant\nSure you remember that a a Jobbik are sure of what was his name Jobbik right or yeah something like that and um\nEverybody cringed at all my way way putting them which mechanical hard in a human being and you know was in South Africa\nRight and yeah exactly and and and and and and you know now artificial\nHearts are pretty routine thing\nIn in the you know was in South Africa right and\nYeah I'm ... and ... and\n... and and you know now artificial hearts are pretty routine thing although now you know with stem cell research and other things going on a we're even getting past the mechanical heart hey by the way in a you talk about things that\nGive me some pause here's one there are three groups of scientists in California and Minnesota and you know I read that it's like Minnesota that's like so random but\nThere you are\nNo you know the minute University of Minnesota's mustard recently do you have a huge research you it's a it's an hour one it's a big school\nNo no you're right you're right I just it just I don't know why it just gives me an article but anyway\nYou have three groups of scientists who are creating a creatures that have never walked the face of the earth before they're called come arrows they're sheep human and pick human ... so these are creatures whose DNA has been it together using human DNA and sheep DNA or human DNA pig DNA\nAnd they're creating these creatures because they will have human Oregon they will have human kidneys human livers human hearts for the purpose of you know transplanting them to patients and need\nAnd you know I get that I had a friend who who died recently because\nHis kidneys just went south and he couldn't get a transplant and boom\nAh but now what that's done is to raise the very real possibility and I discuss the book that\nIf you put too much human DNA into the recipe you know it's it's always a question too much human DNA too little human DNA then you don't get the human organs right if you put in too much DNA then you can have an animal a creature\nThat thinks like him and that has basically human brain\nTrapped inside of a body of a sheep or a pig I mean these these are the things that are very real now\nBecause of our ability to tamper with DNA\nUm so that's one of the things that gives me gives me a little bit like we\nDid we really wanted to and what's interesting is that these guys are doing it\nAnd by the way I quote one of the researchers and says yeah that's that's a real possibility that this is not like you know made up the pie in the sky I mean they even the researchers admits yeah we got to be careful this is a possibility\nBut they're doing this research against the wishes of the NIH the national institutes of health which is the government's number one funny body for biological genetic engineering so even the end I H this kind of very um [noise]\nYeah you know forward thinking funding organization is saying you know maybe we should just push the pause button and decide do we want to do this and if so what are the guidelines for\nThe guard rails I'm sure I'm sure these guys you know just doing it in violation of you know you should probably doing it against the advice of their moms like what do you do it on my the oh my God it reminds\nMe when I was growing up in east LA and then ... says the town over\nAnd I was a real geek I mean I was speaking out when I was a kid and I found a way to make hydrogen gas using stuff that I found in my mom's kitchen and I look back and I'm Out there in the garage at the ... of our [laughter] making hydrogen gas and you know that stuff is explosive\nAnd I ... I Would filled balloons up with it\nAnd then send little insects aloft just to see what happens that's\nA ... I was a little mad scientist in the area and\nCreate your own space program against their will right by the by the way\nGuys that come area you're right the mothers I say why don't you know I get stopped doing that already go do play tiddlywinks or something safer\nMentioned LA\nWhy don't you know I write about filling that already go go play tiddlywinks if something safer\nMentioned LA as you mentioned LA I Want to mention that the the game is still tied in the fifteenth between Boston and LA you kidding me know so I just thought I'd standing fifteens any game\nThree of the world series Richard tweeted out on Twitter he said he's listening to this show and watching\nThe uh the world series game he said it's like sinking a pink Floyd in the wizard of Oz he said the kind of works and so I don't know I guess it I guess that means I'm committed a lot of errors because that's how that's how it's happening but right now still there's two men on and the top of the fifteenth and we're we'll keep\nAn eye on it so sorry Joe ... the the island of Dr Morrow things pretty scary it really is but I I still you know now do you think of what the technology that people do you see all the commercials for\nWhich I'm you know for Siri you know what how cold is it outside I don't want to look out a window Siri is it snowing you know or you know Google ... by me some you know\nBy me some more uh ten meet whatever and these commercials and everybody's focused on that type of assist and I kind of get it\nBut they were just beginning to learn the down side of having a a microphone\nConnected um and on monitored inside of one's house aren't we\nYeah and that's another interesting you bring that up because that was on my short list of things to worry about and that's\nThe other thing we're bringing about ourselves okay you're a ... if you're absolutely\nRight I tell the story of a little girl in Dallas texas\nWho use the Amazon Echo or you know and said hey Alexa buy me a bunch of cookies hey Alexa by the way you know this a dollhouse fancy fancy dollhouse and parents were totally clueless stuff starts arriving at the house the parents freak out\nBut here's the punch line and you would think that the parents will have learned a lesson and like ditch the echo you know get rid of it ah but instead I have the mother quoted as saying you know we need to whisper around ... Alexa now are you\nKidding me [laughter] why take away I mean you know leaders [laughter] yeah I Know it's so big\nBrother in a way to because it's not just I mean that story and ... and again I remind people will get to the phones you're coming up they're already ringing and will line of people to to talk with Michael deal in the end of life as we know it in a few but\nBut that story out of turkey about the supposedly the audio recording that was made by this guy ... um you know apple watch\nThat they were able to monitor his apple watch and record his torture and death now I don't know that I Believe that I don't know that it really really wasn't just microphone implants or for that matter\nMaybe it there in the Saudi constantly they have a they have Google and they had the little theory whenever there and they monitor it that way but however it happened\nThat kind of the debt that passive listening that is going on that we have not yet fully come to terms with what that could mean for our jobs for our relationships are for our communities\nEffort the security of our country I just had an op ed is going to be published very shortly I'm a U.S Congress issued a report on\nIt's had an op ed that it will be published very shortly I'm a U.S a Congress issued a report on Thursday so a saying that um\nThe Chinese are hell bent on a a exploiting the vulnerabilities of something called the Internet of things and that's what we're talking about\nThe anger that kind of a ... year three injuring or your dishwasher everything that's going to do\nAll these smart devices that we're talking about the Lexus or the smart watches the smart as you say refrigerators the smart thermostat on and on and on\n... there are now are more than eight billion Internet of things devices so we call it I O T I talk about it in the book\nAnd the Chinese are ... see this as an opportunity to bug us to spy on it and we are the willing accomplices because we're buying these gadgets bringing them into our own home you talk about the show the thing in\nTo be gone goes goes there yeah more George ... minute soggy voting Jay accent T. [noise]\nMichael before we started getting all these calls waiting for you let's ruled that story back about twenty seconds before because I was ... I had to cut you off but we're going to the bottom of the hour and it's a heartbreak so I couldn't pass on that [noise]\nOh yeah no I was just telling you the story of a a murder that happened to Connecticut and or the husband claimed one story and the police looked into it or his wife was murdered and he claimed one story in the\nWhat the police found was that the woman was wearing of the seats woman wearing a fit that was one of these little smart watches that keeps track of your heart rate how are you walk and so forth and so they downloaded the data from the fit fit\nAnd they found out that the they could actually get this calculate how many feet she walked and it didn't square with the story from the husband\nAnd then and then other things started happening with Facebook in other words what I'm saying is\nSure that that technology out at this husband he ended up being charged with murder because of this this kind of a Internet of things\nThat are buying on every aspects of our lives they can tell you when you're asleep when you're awake how many feet you are what your heart rate uh you know if you watch Netflix ... they they download what you're watching when how for how long I mean\nThere that this is a kind of an invasion of privacy but we've invited it on ourselves than we are well these gadgets\nYeah and I like kill a lot of them I mean I were an apple launched by the way they used that as a plot device that thing about the ... been in a ... a law and order episode last week the same thing\nThey took it from the real life oh did you know they always do you know ripped from today's headlines so he uh but that's where I mean I I think\nThat they like to catch a killer is one thing like the ... good they kind of killer because of the fitbit the hard part will be is when evidence is presented in court that's collected from some of these ancillary passive data collection system\nWhich accidentally convicts somebody who didn't commit a crime I mean that that that hasn't happened yet and I know of but that's going to be the real test of this technology\nYeah no absolutely and I talk about the FBI now having this humongous database of face prince\nRunning a that they've not you're not covering the ... yeah\nAnd and and and they have like a eighty they they allow themselves in eighty percent accuracy rate for the question becomes like okay well that means you have a twenty percent inaccuracy\nRunning with which raises the possibility that you and I got to have the FBI knocking on our\nDoors because they think we committed a crime based on their database but\nThe facial recognition technology that they're using to id and to finger culprits is wrong twenty percent of the time and and by the way researchers who are looking into it from Australia and elsewhere are saying it's it's more than twenty percent\nAnd so this this is what you just described is a very real possibility now where innocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA McGill in the end of life\nInnocent people are going to be fingered by a by a screen up\nA McGill in the end of life as we know it let's get to keep who's in Virginia on coast to coast am key\nHello can you hear me a perfectly good ah are you tonight on my phone turned back up there you go and you had a question from Michael yes Michael and I argue or speaking about the ah\nJarvis cart have a couple of friends one of which I Would be a great guess because of his very experience and service even there's a whistle blower\nThis call them coast to coast and before but uh it'd be great to have them on to tell a story about a lot of things [noise] um one of the um the predecessors of that artificial heart was a a\nHeart open heart surgery that was a heart lung machine\nAnd Dr wrestling Nelson a\nWorked on that at the University of Minnesota understand a sharp a cart was at the University of Utah\nAnd some Thirty years earlier and he and his career as a heart surgery at some paranormal experience is one of which was a\nWhere he did a surgery but a technique that had never been done before and he describes it as after praying to know what to do that basically a ... or whatever was\nPut right in his mind and he did the surgery a from those instructions that he was able to see it in his mind and later\nI got to get you a question because there's so many people who have questions for Michael so do you want to hang on for an open line called the sounds more like that but did you have a question from Michael\nThat could be yeah I'm a wrestling Nelson by the way is\nI'm going to put you on hold I'm going to put you on hold right now and we just let me get back to 'cause I knew we had our time is precious and I open lines is where that kind of blown\nSo let me go to Tracy who is trucking in Alabama with a question for Michael Guillen Tracy\nMichael I got one question for you here where did you ... where did you just stop when do we stop playing God\nOr are we ... we that's a good question I mean are we playing God yeah and when do we played God is maybe is another question but Michael\nWell I think that is the ultimate question that Tracey is asking and uh you know I I quote a very well known biologist in the book\nUm who was actually a a a major participant in in mapping the human genome remembered the human genome project sure it wrapped up in two thousand and three and there was a big ceremony and the White House Bill Clinton was president needs that now we have\nDiscovered the language of God now that we've mapped the human genome well this biologist Craig Venter I quote him in the book and ... and it's a very telling quote\nAnd I have to be careful but he says you know when it comes to biology we don't know blank I'm not going to use the word he uses but when it comes to biology we don't know blank now this is a guy who was in the thick of it\nAnd this this is directly an answer to trace is excellent question that in effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is look we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nIn effect what Craig Venter is in South is saying is what we're we're toying with something we don't know squat about\nAnd and and that is a recipe for dangerous picture a child playing with matches or worse than that plane with a nuclear bomb or playing with\nA dynamite you know you pick your your your pick your image imagery and that is really the picture that emerges when you read my book\nWhatever you think about the technology and there's a lot of positive but let's keep in mind that you're going to have Ninety nine positive consequences wonderful sunshine positive consequences like the neural prosthetics but all it takes is one thinker\nThat can read it with him right there but does everything else\nBut I think that's the crux two of the playing God\nPremise are we playing God or are we would we cure a disease if the disease is natural it was as God made it natural in the earth is hurricanes are we not playing God when we cure a disease\nI I I I get what you're saying and that's why I tend to avoid that phrase although I Know it's a popular phrase phrase\nRight and that's what I'm saying it's too weak to use for the context as it doesn't really encompass all the ways in which\nYou know when we make a better break pad or do I mean there were always attempting to try to save lives and sometimes those will come with unintended consequences but it was really a matter of playing God I I think it's more true with the ... thing I think that gets into a very weird area though [laughter]\nYeah no no I agree and and I I think you know what it's like when we restore sight the blind with these retinal transplants I I mean that can be said we're playing\n... so what I like to do is look I\nWhen I was at ABC News I covered the Persian Gulf War story you remember when they lift the oil fields on\nFire oh totally I was\nI was the first TV correspondent to actually find my way to those oil fill a oh a oil fields that were on fire and the way I have to get their way through a minefield we got a guy from aramco the Saudi Arabian oil company he knew away through the mind feels\nAnd so that's how I I think of trace this question is\nI see it there I see as navigating a mine field\nAnd as you know so far we've been able to avoid a stepping on that one mind it's gonna do it in\nBut as we progress with some of this stuff that is unsettling and outright dangerous never mind that great stuff okay that's gonna sunshine but I as I say all it takes for us to do is to step on that one mind that one hit and mine\nAnd it's just going to blow us up\nTo get all the health care they need and making a person's house adaptable lost

I mean on Saturday when I get\nA Dell yeah some day in time can you keep you know it seems\nThat there is certain people that are so beautiful it's so wonderful own lives and it just kills in or what I think you're\nWell you're very sweet but I agree with you and I think that morning period after art I think it was just it just even though many people were anticipating that this complication was going to get worse I\nI think it's ... you know if you'll pardon the expression I think we all you know lost her breath over that we just do just cut us off guard so yeah and I'm Sorry and I I yeah I think I think you have you lived in Ohio with\nThat and that this is they are quick my father is it right here oh cool apps toy and I grew up you know\nI grew up around radio stations trends and ... yeah [laughter] that's\nI Would never did that start track that oh I Know that ... that\nCan get there but I just see it as a kid\nThey were like oh my God it's a\nWell it's nice to chat with you I tell me real quickly uh so what kinds of shit what station did your father worked for\nA ... ... don't Cape deal Iran and cats and they were where\nKnow I think you so much I appreciate that I Would like to I was like to hear that you God Bless you have a great night\nI I've always worked I'm not that technically advance I mean I can handle the little one and probably two oh one of any class about engineering on something like that but I Love you lift engineers they really know the stuff\nThat's really cool they can just build something out of nothing I'm All right so that brings me to keep from Virginia is back so Keith had called the um when we were talking with our guest less an hour and it seemed much more appropriate to have him on here for open lines so\nI'm Glad you called back heat so you you had a friend who it was you were telling a story about how it is the surgeon had essentially experience to kind of almost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely delivered where he's\nYou had essentially experience to kind is almost like a scientific revolution but it came into almost sort of divinely delivered where he suddenly knew exactly what to do in this complicated surgery do I get that right\nOh that's correct because I understand it and um that individual by the way and and ah thanks for having to get back on and sorry for not being a little bit quicker and smoother with everything but um somebody very topic for eight disgusted and and that related to some of the things I wanted to say too but\nI'm sure this gentleman Dr wrestle I'm now and uh\nAlso had a a he relates to experience that of a failure or twice in surgery which his patients died\nAnd they were children and they later\nMany years later a visited him from the spirit world\nAnd delivered a message for him to give to their parents and so anyway this individual by the way is the same rough on them now and that in a at the age of Ninety three\nAfter having been an apostle for the church of Jesus Christ of latter day saints having left is world renowned medical career a became the predators of a church in January of this year at the age of Ninety three\nAnd a an amazing man even a damn downhill skier at that age and\nUm [noise] anyhow um what I wanted to get to was a I mentioned before a couple of things regarding astronomy and some other things in which\nThings revealed by the prophet Joseph Smith gave a little bit more and fight and from time to time I hear things aren't coast to coast am that there can be perhaps a connecting and for ... informed that link about paranormal and things from traditional Judeo Christian\nTeaching a that we find them and also in the Bible\nAnd and and that is a lot of the things that Joseph ... revealed or have to reveal to him I should say by a Jesus Christ and many other this or that he had\nProfits\nAnd he brought about a lot of new scripture hatred scripture as well as new scripture [noise]\nYou know and and you're going to get about thirty more seconds usually go ahead and I said\nBasically to wrap it up the turtle man is one concept that he spoke about it and he taught about and I wondered if you've ever heard of that book I just learned that recently by Truman naps and there's a very good\nYoutube video Joseph Smith and the recovery of eternal man because a lot of those principles seem to have\nGoes [noise] well I look at um ... guys\nOh so so many not means somebody playing a little game like you look at me\nLike I'm Out here every now and then you know I'm a I'm going to move around\nYou that way they manage forests\nWanted all the as you correctly and and the and the jargon so they're all facing out towards out or they get to order it would just have their own man right there\nYet but the thing of that that moving of the ... I mean it really is it's an amazing video and it's for people that don't believe in in goes I think you'll enjoy it um but the scissors in depends who the ... in this little cup holder and the district moving around\nAnd this is it's not I mean you could almost make an argument like maybe the jar was on the slanted surface or something and we couldn't see it from the camera angle and they're just having a good laugh but I I don't get the thing with the the pencils in the than the scissors so yeah benevolent pulled their guys I'll go with that until they've got\nAny other theory to a a backup Michelle is in Wyoming on coast to coast day I'm Michelle\nAh wow Hi I'm Sorry I'm Around not like you know\nYou get first things first the first things first if I can put you on hold and come back in a minute but that's easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second look at take on on on the first time caller long time\nYou put you on hold and come back in a minute but that'd be easier\nI Know I can talk right now for a second look at all and I'm a first time caller longtime listener and nice to have you what I was wondering\nWhy it's like I was raised Catholic and then like I chose to kind of walk away from that and explore other options and other things out there because\nYou know I just I don't know that's that's the way I felt inside an entire gas Michael I'm closer to when he first got on he was talking about that you know that scientific side of him and then\nWhen I sat at later\nTell them to read the Bible and now he's changed his mind on it and it's a Christian so what I Would run rang and I don't know how well various jar with religious stuff exactly but I'm a little bit\nLike I ... I Wonder how often when I'm driving down the road and how we can trust the authenticity of the Bible because you know it [noise] I've often heard that a lot of the major story from it like the story of the ... and the story of um you know like a [noise] a savior\nOur hero type figures they run a virgin and stuff those steroids can be found in like ... that the call tax you know like ... trillion in tax for like ... and ... you know whatever creates the Bible so\nYou're talking about the ... you're talking about ... if you're talking about the story of NOAA for example um and there are some very interesting parallels\nIn the in the guild diminish narratives should the news story [noise] um and you are correct in saying that there had been other traditions that had a sort of\nMan God or ... that was birthed by a human mother but from a a divine father and that that is just another version of that so the question to me\nAlways is not this to me and this is where I think a lot of it in my personal opinion I Believe this is where some people get really hung up because I'm not going I'm not trusting the Bible because it has so many facts in it I trust the bubble because of how many true it has in it\n[noise] okay there's a there's a difference to me and there are true that\nWe know to be a worse\nSteering by right there there you you can count you can count on these troops that for example when you're good to others they will be good to you or even if they are good do you you still have to be good to them because it only makes us is Jewish worse\nYou know and so there are ... and and a lot of these stories to tell the truth the actual facts of the stories it's always been less interesting to me too so I'll be honest survival\nIs filled with you know story that can be found in other places and then we can still trust is saying like the other information on the bottom\nWill know here I Would say though is that even some of those other stories\nThere are some of those things which you have heard that probably aren't true so there are some people who win Christianity was catching on over two thousand years ago\nOr ... other people started in ... like I'm emphasizing something from their tradition saying she were just like Christianity and so it was because of the rise of Christianity that they started to really promote\nThe things that they said had pre existed that story whether they did or not there's really there really isn't always a lot of proof of that there isn't in the Egyptians\nThere's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it do you can you do\nIn the in the Egyptians there's there's a little bit of a tradition of that but but it in the end does it matter I mean it it it do you can you do you live your life better\nIt does it improve your life that's the question and I think getting hung up on worrying about whether or not the Bible is a book of science there's a lot of people treat it like it's supposed to be a science book and it's not I don't think I'm ... and I think the stories are very instructive and we need to you know re learn from them every day\nHow comedy thinking that that's my best answer for you I Hope it gives you something to chew over while you're while you're on the open road with a full tank of gas\nAnd there's a long time out here that they found [laughter] good\nWill be ... be a help your bed ma'am a gym and you get where you're going well and thank you so much for joining in and I'm Glad you're was the first time I got to be there with you\nUm I go to a Justin who's in Texas on coast to coast Justin\nHey buddy hey hey yeah and it's nice to be on my list and that river ever actually called in or have you know wanted to take it to the left everybody's on the the religious aspect but uh do whatever you want you to some more scientific stuff yeah sure I'm not sure if\nA lot of people carpet on mosque interview or he had with Joe Rogan and\nI only smoked ... yeah they're\nThey're I think there are a little out there but uh I think somebody is uh\nThat logically advanced in the mind and has the means to do a lot pretty impactful when he says things about like a a guy and a stabbing addict augmentation and stuff\nAnd uh I really thought it was a neat metaphor they use than how human beings are pretty much augmented already carrying their cell phones around\nYou know we have the ability you know the massive computations and access to any kind of data that we had that we want\nAnd all that and he said that you know in the very\nNear future that could possibly be a thing that we could do hands free\nYou know and uh you know what would that do maybe to the educational system where we go to school would be just like philosophy classes to learn how to think properly you know\nYeah well we need more of those I think we need more of those no I think I think I think I think philosophy would be we treat ... ... yeah I think we treat philosophy of some sort of exotic thing and it was really the first thing around which all education was built and\nHave you know it's just a fine arts credit that people just take\nHalf right ... ... and if it's not that it's dance you know or something which you know so I can dance to offer you don't have to go [laughter]\nBut you know to your point on on ... I'm a big believer in I'm In his technological ... solutions on big big unseen ability um\nThe Joe Rogan interview is troublesome because I think actually if you want to look at it in a different way all the time he spent talking about being depressed\nOr you know his mental state from over working and not sleeping enough and et cetera I I think that reveal much more of the humanness which we don't and we tend to think almost of Ilan must be some big giant slot machine\nYeah some big and the whenever he's just he's a human being\nRight and he may be a slightly unstable human being these days I I ... on\nVenus is are you know I ... that's a very intellectual it always has some kind of inner struggle\nRight and so I'm a I I'm an investor actually in a very small way I'm In a couple of thousand dollars for the stock which took a hit after that Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly what I live in a day or something\nI was in the stock which took a hit after the Joe Rogan interview and uh and has recovered mostly what I live in a day or something like that won't affect stock\nWell I don't know because I see my argument would be that Iran must we I invested in ... mosque mhm right I didn't I invested in him I decided at some point probably after the sixty minutes interview\nOn his dentures but as a person\nYeah I thought that guy smart he gets it um and I think he's going to come up with cool stuff and it's going to make life better in the making a lot of money and so I bought on that basis so when I'm watching him in the interview I'm watching the wheels come off\nRight I'm watching the wheels circling ... and just like watching a Tesla with the wheels are coming up it would be very worrisome so I'm I I think anytime the head of the company like that become so synonymous with the product\nI think they have to be much more careful about how they live their lives in public that's my feeling on that but but I don't want to take away from him 'cause I Know I agree to use its own genius\nI think he exposed himself a little more on it in ... on public but I mean I think the thought process that everything is pretty consistent whether he was an even read it or\nTouching up children childcare licensing also increasing the availability of positive and nurturing learning environment and provide support for families by regulating high quality developmentally appropriate and flexible care through a wide range of options ones using your child care facility look for the state of Nevada licenses laid on the facilities well\nBurr more information maybe ... dot ...\nDot Gov that deep PBA aging dot ... dot Gov again when it comes to choosing newer childcare facility obese or to look for the state of Nevada license wait on the facilities wall this message is sponsored by the Nevada division a public and behavioral health\nAired in cooperation with the Nevada broadcasters association and the station\nAnd\nFrom the justice of hearts nova home loan studios ... north Las Vegas ...

I wanted to say something about the border but you started talking about the Bible I'm not I was brought up as a Roman Catholic but I supplement subsequently become an atheist agnostic down not so I don't know what to say that you really\n[laughter] well I wasn't trying to hijack this show that it was just ... you know couple of callers mentioned something and next thing you know I'm I'm John away but it's a space I live in I live in a space during the week so they kinda bleeds throughout the Arab afraid this\nAnd you know when you said that job\nYou know people come out of church and then they act like an atheist and the reason I'm an atheist this because ah\nI Can't possibly believing in God that show hypocrite or whether you're talking about the outrage over or all all the other guy is up\nYou know in the Bible or you know how can I possibly believe wage of ... when he kills children by the thousands while you're talking about Passover\nWhere he sang the age of ... first born Egyptians or the great flood\nOr Saddam ... more of their own data innocent children killed there so I mean like\nThe first one they enjoy the great flood or Saddam they go more than ... children killed there so I mean yeah I can I possibly believing that God like that\nSo you know I guess part of that again comes down to how much are we going to invest in a particular narrative as being the defining story so I accept what you're saying and I think\nDon't get my point wrong about atheists I I I I I Know you're gently chiding me on the on the offending part\nBut let me just say when I say atheist I really mean that in the strictest sense I think a lot of people live their life\nLike there is no God and then when they go to the ... they go to church somehow to hedge their bets and they look like they do that and but they never actually it doesn't actually make a change in what they do is all I mean and so\nYou know everybody puts their faith in something let me just put it that way well everybody\nFree bottle again dial pound to five zero and see the key word free bottle\nIs on you talked to the voting rights indeed [noise]\n\nIs it belongs on ... and by the way things are let me come on and play again it's always fun when it gets to come on and hosted coming up tomorrow night will do it again Melissa is in South Carolina on coast to coast am ... where do you want to Jake is\nHello I Am a question about this site but pediatric Janet the addition that I bought it he doesn't last it affected the last that I first want to ask are you in Manhattan, Kansas now\nAnd not yet but he's asking I'm just I'm I'll be there soon I I'm Still back in the boxes I'm Still in Phoenix with the time being but I'm getting there\nOkay I looked for mission hills Kansas is to get younger line as though I I Know where you're going to treat you well\nWell it's funny I have a I have a property in I have a property in view for um South Carolina no\nI Love that area [laughter] I don't ...

where you mentioned that they called Jesus like an imaginary figure and let's go figure and then they went into my ...\nHe was elected to the asked now that's what it was yeah and and that's that's I hadn't heard that myself but that's what he reported elections and I'd have prevented at heart\nBut yes he did say that it's not immediately it triggered in my brain I bought this perfect set of Encyclopedia Britannica\nFrom the church mouse [laughter] door and I was so excited then when I got at home I opened it up I might have been the first person to ever open it and I write for a first part the first introductory part and\nIt was dedicated to Queen Elizabeth and Ronald Reagan wow and then you're going to if you haven't stand this he would probably be ... by it so then it explained that this was a new format for Encyclopedia Britannica and they created\nThe alphabetical volumes\nAnd they they chose what to put it at length in that heart and then they end that the other selections at their discretion and\nSo when you look that Jesus in this edition\nOf Encyclopedia Britannica it\nHas just a few little paragraphs and it it\nCosts to them that typical figure someone who might have live during a certain time period and then it represents that as a way to look in the end that are more information and then if you turn to Islam\nIt is like page after page after page in the regular section and still you know anything about it\nNo it's very interesting it's very ... it was a good look over your shoulder will you talk to you you're doing the it's\nIn it's in a box there you know and I just kind\nOf put them away and that kind of feel like like\nAnd you will you talk to you you're doing that and it's in a box there you know and I just kind of put them away and I kinda feel like like they're not really\nEven [laughter] you don't you do you draw your you do to reduce the idea\nThat I mean like the as you said\nI I Know they're still printing they must be printing a bird you know they don't completely be anything yeah\nLaughter there that can have a laugh and slow that it could buy it gave them how to work at home and saw that in fact started looking up things and I thought who fly to kiss and make it this way and so if you find out I mean if you could do home or\nOn the ball to look at that I'm burning treatment that ideas so they'll have to wait maybe tomorrow night if I can figure out something between now tomorrow night or I Will and I appreciate that and I'll get to see if I Do it'll be in the first hour tomorrow night\nAn otherwise I'm not sure there will be back on getting things you may have to wait a while but most people do you do but they use really it's really very interesting let me go to Karen\nWho is in Alaska on coast because I Am and Karen\nHi um this link and with she was just saying and it definitely ties in with last night there was some gas and um it does show was short um first of all I wanted to say you are by far my favorite\nShow host and has to gorge but you seem to be afraid of controversial subject\n[laughter] though they do that [laughter] so\nYou know politically correct though we can't talk about it or they just know\nThat you know I I I guess that is funny because I I should listen more maybe I'm I'm Out of step maybe I should I should be more like you said you will you know ... what what\nI wanted to change the subject to in like I said you may go along with what she would say and I'll tell you a few things that I'll get off the air and everybody else\nAnd put in a sense where um\nThe Mandela Effect first of all you've probably heard about it\nThere's a million dollars in memory to\nYeah will laugh about all they face falls memory\nAnd everything in the world remembers that one way and then suddenly it's not and and last night the example they gave with them I Believe it was I they all live in six in the Bible the wolf and the lamb versus the way we grew up hearing about the lion and the lamb\nThat a couple of other examples and and it's in any Bible you can find a except gift what I got a catalog in the mail today\nAnd somebody had a prayer because he was saying last night they had also changed the Lord's Prayer and maybe 'cause the catalog print like why did I dunno thrower comforter stir remember what it was but anyway it was the way we remembered it\nSo Luke I Am your father now if you look at the movie it says no I Am your father um the things that have changed life was like a box of chocolate you watched that movie now Forrest Gump\nLife is like a box of chocolates Sally Field you remember when she\nSaid you're really liked me likely you're right right now they're saying\nIf you watch it now says she says you really liked me now\nOkay that's when\nNo when she was saying the encyclopedia\nHow you have a couple of paragraphs about Jesus and pages and pages them all on that last night and I agree with this it's like I said I've been doing the research for a couple of year and a half maybe so they've been saying that third baby that they're they said something about their goal was to make a I don't know portal into another dimension\nMarie Singh demon into our yeah well they were doing St panic rituals outside that place I'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now\nOh they were doing faint panic rituals outside that place I'm and I'm Wondering if maybe that's why they're diminishing Jesus now in in ... as we all know what he does you know the things he believes in any way\nYelling things we would do is to do be there'll be a victim of the Mandela Effect well even as you're talking about it because it all night and I was more ah but here's here's what I Want to\nIRS when I'm propose to do the ... the thing I mentioned to you about Islam in about ... about Mohammed\nIs that what we often do and I think you're you're getting to this ... this is a completely fair point is that we we rely on other people to give us our memory\nAnd so we think we heard something we think we remember it away to hear somebody else and then somehow we insert their memory in two hours and and and whenever we may have held we might have originally thought of the line the way it was ... you know but the more people repeat it\nAnd that's the only way that you you know that that they can hear it so I think the Mandela Effect is very interesting I think it's compelling I'm Sorry I missed the show we brought a great examples um I Will say when it comes to Bible translation just remember this it you can't do a perfect translation\nInto English from Hebrew in Greek not from that era Hebrew enough that Eric Greek is impossible to do a perfect translation there will always be changed\nAnd some of them are just as simple ones some of them are just you know pronouns in people in ... the name of the person that was talking because it's easier to follow the story but you are changing it you know just by dropping a permanent and putting a person's name id but others are much trickier because there are verbs that literally don't exist anymore\nUm and so we have to quibble inform facing was a verb for a long time I am facing\nAnd we just don't use that terminology so you know the fact that the translations keep changing that's great that's when I'll be ... ... ... ... I Hope not for politically correct purposes but because it's just a matter of getting it\nCorrect which I think is more interesting All right so let me go to um uh Marty who's in Tulsa and the time we have left on goes to goes to a a Marty\nAnd of course you're a lawyer a first I've ever tried to call in the coast to coast I've been listening to her like others for years and years I\nHad to hit the readout about fourteen times that I was surprised to be able to get on\nA leading right\nI had a and it's nice by the way to hear your back on coast once in awhile I bought you uh had disappeared forever\nAnd I [laughter] yeah [laughter]\nThe Army National guard and gets you started in an array of them related career fields such as information technology communication systems special forces engineer's technical engineering air traffic control and chemical and biological radiological nuclear science\nGet a head start on your career and exciting new field while earning money to pay for college\nAll while serving in your own community\nLog on to the national guard dot com for talk to a recruiter in your area to learn about all of the stem career opportunities available to you in the Army National guard sponsored by the veteran Army National guard and everybody in the ... the broadcasters association at this station\nFrom the justice of heart Nobel home loan studios ... north Las Vegas ...

think it's been about a year year and a half but it's always great to have you back and you and I stayed in touch other ways as well but and so it you know I just I'd miss your show GV and I were talking to have been talking about this what God's name happened\nYou know it's a it's something I run into a lot of questions about I mean not last episode we had almost two million viewers which was you know excellent for history\nAnd for some reason they decided to call it quits and unfortunately I didn't consider asking my opinion yeah your name but that's that's the right\nYeah that is but I mean GV and I we're we're watching it every week we're we're tuned do we thought it was a great show I think it was definitely a poor choice on on History Channel ah but yeah I missed\nI've gotta say Jeff I Am I actually wasn't watching it right when it was airing but I went back and watch them all on on demand on history demand whatever it is on my cable\nAnd I got hooked um you know I I ended up binge watching it and watch it right through the last episode that was posted and I didn't know the disposition to the program I kept waiting for something else to come out 'cause I was a book I wanted to know what's gonna happen and I imagine there are a lot of people with similar disappointment\nAnd we lost jobs so I said all of that stuff he's he was disappointed and he slammed the phone down Jeff he's got a real short fuse\nHe um you know if if you have it ... it was called a um American a river right and it was an American heard him it was on History Channel\nYeah and it was a great show honestly and but I kind of felt like they left us hanging like history left us\nRight and it was an American wrote him it was on History Channel\nYeah and it was a great show honestly and but I kind of felt like they left us hanging like history left us hanging yeah if I remember what happened I'm In the last episode that I saw which had to be the last one there were about to dig up a an area in front of the what is now the post office in Chicago where the murder castle was\nYeah right and that's what they were going to do they thought they were going to uncover ... I don't remember specifically Desmond so long ago now um but they were about to do that and uh you know in in sea to next week we're going to show you what's going on and all of a sudden ... next week never came and I looked for weeks and weeks\nBefore I finally realized in history did that with that other show to the um the zodiac killer sure I Know yeah for whatever\nReason they seem to take those shows off and oh well you just ... you saw these shows are the serial killers and stuff disappear\nWhen they were so intriguing suggest I don't know if you've heard my a question before we lost you there but I was saying that um I had been tj watched uh the episodes of American River and um you know I got to the last episode I was hooked\nI kept waiting for the next one to show up it never did I was very very disappointed and I suspect there are people all over the country is not the world there were similar will be disappointed [noise]\nI get I get that same um emotion and feeling almost everywhere I go but I I got to tell you all history was incredible to work with\nUh they they hire the best people possible I mean our director producers the actors that they hired to play you know all my co star Amarillo spots is is just going to be a superstar see the film and then for networks right now\nAnd you know history was incredible work with so you know those those guys are extreme professionals in the entertainment business and and they they had a good reason I'm sure and I'm hoping they uh reopen at one day and er I I'd like to go back and do some more work with them on it\nWill indeed be made a good point it was like all of a sudden your show disappeared and the zodiac killer show disappeared and some other ones and it it almost seemed like they\nSort of just stepped away from the serial killer aspect of just trying to trying to get into their heads and figure out what which truly going on in the real history behind it but that's what history is about and I agree with you know the History Channel there's some great people over there I've I've\nTalked with with many individuals who work there and who are high up there and it's it's just a great great bunch of people\nYou know and um you know they put a lot of money\nTo America river guys when when we first budget it you know the ... of the oil is great\nYou know the numbers were a hundred two hundred thousand dollars that ended up costing a million dollars so you know for cable TV network they they went they put their toll on the line and and they they they went for the the the bleachers with the\nYou know what they're swinging I can never criticize them ever for that\nYeah of course and there's no reason to criticize you know people make decisions in program decisions based on whatever they have to use\nThe bases decisions on it's just as a lot of people that that were kind of a hooked and left hanging so just remind me ... I didn't want to get into any of this deeper discussion before this breaks wouldn't have a couple of minutes here but remind me where did the did American River leave off you were just about to excavate the area in front of the post office weren't you\n[noise] you know that I'm working on that now that's a much bigger project than the eggs a nation of the grave I mean I'm going to have to get permission from the department of justice the FBI it's going to be an incredible a process I'm going to do it and I'm going to find a network that wants to back me up but you know when when\nGoing to be an incredible a process I'm going to do it\nAnd I'm going to find a network that wants to back me up on but you know when we ended up American River we we had a ... the grave the University of Pennsylvania the anthropologist there you know ... Nobel Prize winners we're going through the remains trying to make an identification\nWhich the court had ordered them to do we were waiting for DNA results\nAnd pretty much the show just end it there and just left a lot of people out hanging and you should've seen I had ... and thousands of emails and tax asking me hey Jeff what the heck happened and to tell you guys the truth I didn't know\nNew loose lips she again Jim I Know I'm I'm Still here do you do you maybe you got to get a call or something 'cause he put out for a second\nNo I I got to tell you guys I've never had a problem with my phone and not you know we're um we're I like you say we're cutting in and out a little bit\nIt's always our fault [laughter]\nSo so again you you saying that um the exhumation they were trying to identify the remains it was just the state order from the state of Pennsylvania what do I don't remember if there was any determination if you actually if we saw the conclusion of that on the on the program it's been so long\nYou know I I was watching the show myself I hadn't seen the final episode the final cut and when it ended I was shocked and then the next day NBC News came out\nA report that DNA and dental records have proved that connection between me and my grandfather and I called the I called NBC News up and say what what are you guys doing where are you getting these DNA reports I haven't seen one and they belong to me by the court order\nAnd it went on for two or three weeks like that until finally NBC News was forced to retract their\nStatements that the DNA had matched but unfortunately Jason as you know how it happens you know their headlines sake DNA batches Jeff might just the legend than that and the rumors are done when they retracted they put it on page five in this little box that no one gets three\nRight exactly yeah that's how it always goes it is so the so again the final disposition of all that is what\nWell and you know I Would uh if you had history on right now or the you can there would be an argument but I Believe that we prove it wasn't home in the grave\nAnd that a substitute was not only executed but buried in his place and he went off with a blank check\nTo visit blows that had irritated if you know the New York times wrote about bad calling it the homes curse the jury foreman the prosecutor the trial judge\nBut you know I look at those things as as I wasn't given a choice and I'm not going to run away from that as everyone else in my family had for at least a hundred years\nBut with what you were saying Jeff you you have the belief that the genetic makeup or what ever made him do this has been passed down genetically correct ... DNA and so forth but of course you're in your control that you know following the same you\nKnow and really no one in my family has only I mean my father was a war hero my my grandfather was very successful my great grandfather was a mayor in Florida I doubt any of them even had a you know a citation for Jay walking except\nYou know we all knew we were different JV and just\nYou know this this sudden you know knock on the door with this identification of you know a man who had perhaps the highest IQ ever recorded at University of Michigan he probably could have been a Louis ... store had he wanted the beach and instead he went off on this path of evil\nAnd it was something that history has largely swept under the rug and I and I still believe guys you know with shows like yours there's a chance that we could learn something about what makes a brilliant man like this evolving just such a monster\nSo how much of a how much can you tell us about the DNA work and any of the work that was done has an Arizona show yet or are these things that you're saving you want to present in the in some more sophisticated for\nNo no it's it's a the DNA\nAre these things that you're saving you want to present in the in some more sophisticated for\nNo no no it's it's a the DNA is out I I gave a talk in Michigan this summer I was a matter of fact Jason your old partner grant was there and you know I I ah revealed to the audience why I Believe the DNA\n... you know we we eggs on the ... the body and from the grave we took DNA samples\nI'm at the University of Pennsylvania with incredible anthropologist these were these were ladies that you know they research the pyramids and the stakes than they are they're just they're amazing scientists\nUm we sent it to the most renowned DNA lab in the world in London I mean history was paying up you know they they were really fund and the whole measure and\nWe waited and waited and waited all summer long for some results until finally\nYou know the University of Pennsylvania and this was in private conversations with me they gave up on the DNA and they decided they make the id based on teeth alone\n[noise] and then when I saw NBC News can't come out with these headlines about in a DNA matching mind you know I went off the deep end than uh uh we were ready to file lawsuits\nWell of course until finally finally NBC back down on that and you know in my mind there's no doubt whatsoever the DNA never match um\nWhich was what the court order to be done for the identification\nAnd instead the scientists made the ID that it was homes based on a medical record of a of a strange Dr dentist that had visited homes in prison before the execution a dead men walking examination\nBut now guys you'll you'll find his dad's name we're starting to uncover evidence that Holmes actually requested this man to do the examination\n... and the dental records that they used to compare with the body we exhausted that were never homes is in the first place and we're trying to track that down now because\nAnything involving homes he played he played chess in everything he did that's the time he was the the Chicago Tribune called them the greatest fraud that ever struck Chicago\nAnd everything he was was a game of chess and I tried to convince the scientists that the U. Penn of this that ... not to jump into this silly evidence of teeth\nTo make their determination but you know as scientists there they looked at the stuff and they saw numbers in data and it all worked out for them despite you know me telling them hey this was the guy who made a living substituting that diverse\nHiring dentist to make fake teeth and then showing the tea to an insurance company to pull off the fraud on the insurance policy itself and I said this was just his ammo when you've gotta\nGot to realize that before you make the decision and unfortunately I couldn't I couldn't get them to see who we were dealing with\nWell and he was a guy who understood how the authorities and everybody looked at death so he he already had the perfect ability to cover it up and make it appear as if as if he was dead in a certain way and move on\nExactly I mean I tried to explain to them this was the guy that built the murder castle hotel in preparation for the world's fair coming to Chicago I mean if if there's a picture of a premeditated murder in the you know blacks law dictionaries should be of homes and the murder\nI go I mean if if there's a picture of a premeditated murder in the you know blacks law dictionaries should be of homes and the murder castle\nAnd I see you as you said he was the master of the science of death and then baking the cause of that death and then hiding any evidence or remains that good you know place him in jeopardy as far as legal gills\nAnd it's something you know I'll get to it I'll get to the bottom of it shows like yourself a lot and I want to thank you again and with the you know the fan base that I'm building now people fascinated with this horrible man it's only a matter of time it's just\nIt's just hard work it's like you know I'm now I'm I'm dealing with like you know I'm doing some back and forth with the department of justice and the FBI about them giving me permission to excavate sixty third and walls where the murder castle once stood it's now a United States post office which is federal property\nSo I Will have to have the attorney general of the United states\nAnd the director of the FBI sign off on my request which is you guys know is going to take a couple of years but it will happen because when they bought that property guys the murder castle was still standing\nThey tore it down they build over the the spot and then they built the post office largely over the top but mostly over the side\nAnd in doing so they knew what the building was they knew murders had been committed there and they knew\nThose victims had never been identified and and I'm trying to be gentle with the FBI guys I I don't want to get in a fight with them I Want them to do this of their own free will knowing that\nYou know America doesn't do that we don't cover mass graves of identified citizens in in in one of our major cities and we can turn that around by\nYou know having DePaul University by having his fridge our step back in but you know excavating those grounds and then using DNA to identify some of homes as victims and and uh I don't I don't have any doubt they're going to agree eventually\nBut it's going to be a two or three year process\nWell I Know you actually took a good friend of mine to executive producer to the basement of a building Mike Nichols you probably remember that and my\n... you know what Jason Mike is one of my favorite guys and all of TV\nYeah actually he was in my executive producer and go Centers for the last five years of the show six years this you know he's just a great guy\nYeah I agree it All right so we're going to take a quick break and this this subject just starting\nSo we're going to be here for quite a while on the phone number is eight four four six eight seven seven six six nagging little free for four six eight seven seven six six number and be opening up the phone lines in second hour the show we're talking with Jeff Majid\nAuthor actor a great great grandson of each each homes you listen to ...
