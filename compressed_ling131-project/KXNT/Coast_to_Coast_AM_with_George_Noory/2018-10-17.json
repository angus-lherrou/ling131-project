told because shall we walked into the Saudi embassy as you said and never walked out\nHe was he was I mean there's no doubt about it and not only was he a genius but he was a prolific genius he um he proved it over and over again or he was just unbelievably productive and he just wrote so many great great shows for for television and film\n[noise] ah one of our friends marches decree I wrote a book about the twilight zone then in the subsequent book the twilight zone companion he said that rod Serling you do write most of his shows by dictating in a Dictaphone while he was floating in this pool\n[laughter] well he he definitely wrote most of the shows by dictating he did dictate from pretty much from Nineteen fifty five on word um I don't know if he did most of them in the\nPool in the pool but he's\nCertainly dictated most of his scripts and and honestly I don't know how he did it I I don't know how anybody can write that way but certainly with a rare breed a he was unique and he was able to do it somehow\nSo let's go back before the twilight zone even started tell us a little bit about rod Serling who he was he was a veteran was he not\nShow was yeah he um he he enlisted in the army the day after high school graduation so he was um [noise] you know he was had the patriotic fervor\nOf you know having seen you know Pearl Harbor and he he wanted to do his part so he enlisted as soon as he possibly could and he had this um this idea that he wanted to be a paratrooper aid that was just he was gung ho on it he wanted to be a paratrooper and he got his wish she was\nAssigned to the five hundred eleventh parachute infantry regiment of the eleventh airborne and he saw some pretty heavy combat in in the Philippines and lady and a and lose on 'em and it's ... it's called them for life and and it affected pretty much everything that he that he did from that point forward\nSome of his episodes for the twilight zone had a war type of personality to them and did he get that from his combat oh ... ... as it's yeah he\nUm he went back to the battlefield um several times a before the twilight zone during the twilight zone after the twilight zone so [noise] um it was always there was always part of his makeup you know the the experiences that he had so yeah there are a couple of\nTwilight zone episodes particularly at one called the purple testament which is actually set in lady um during World War two so that was as close to the guts of literally revisiting his his combat experience in twilight zone and then several other other shows like I said before and after this while I\nWas fortunate to be born right in the golden age of television wasn't he\nYes he uh he certainly was it was a time when\nTelevision was obviously the new kid on the block you know radio is still king in the late forties when rod was first coming up and television needed writers or was it was it was this\nFast you know if they've asked we find it was a vast medium that was just devoid of talent at the time and ... you know a jumped right into it and he said he was so prolific any wrote so much\nThat he just sent stuff out and stuff out and so finally started being accepted and and soon enough he was you know his shows were you know we're all over the place\nDid you have a chance to talk to Scott Carol ... wife\nI did not unfortunately no no the way they hit a tree with that quite a person indeed I bet yeah yeah\nNow with with rod he started before he got in the twilight zone he was a writer for other kinds of shows was any\nOh sure sure there are some people may not know this but rod Serling was without question the most\nWriter in television before the twilight zone he had written you know you won three consecutive Emmy Award for best dramatic writing in Nineteen fifty five fifty six and fifty seven ah toilets on sort of in fifty nine I'm so he was at the top of the of the heap or before the twilight zone came out and\nHe just kind of took that dramatic you know just straight for drama sensibility into the twilight zone and\nGave it that little fantasy twist on it\nHe was very socially minded and I think he was frustrated because a lot of times when he wanted to put social things in his writings prior to twilight zone the sponsors went ballistic and always tried to a critique him editorialize and even controlling\nYeah yeah that was that was the big you know the big problem that Serling ran into is that he believed that it's a writer's job to do those things that the writers job to address the issues of his time\nAnd every time he tried to address any issue of any social import on television the censors would get this way the sponsors would get in this way and it was frustrating for him and\nThankfully for ... for rod he was successful enough and he had built such a name for himself that they were willing to give him his own show and he had always loved science fiction\nHe loved fantasy science fiction horror you know all that kind of thing so he\nCreated the twilight zone because he's always wanted to do a show like the twilight zone but he also was able to take it and say you know what I can probably get some of this stuff by if I did it in a fantasy or science fiction setting when it will be a little less controversial\nEvery twilight zone episode Nick that I recall every twilight zone episode had some kind of social issue or a meaning behind it it wasn't just a television show where the cool ending it had a message didn't it\nOh absolutely if it was a TV series that just had a cruel twist ending we wouldn't be talking about it right now you know it it's a it was always deeper than that certainly ... episodes were always deeper than that\nUm because he again believe that that was part of a the artists job the art if it's going to be art it has to do what he would say that has to say something about something and you know it has to be entertaining he did wants to entertain but at the same time you have to say something about something\nWhat do you think some of the ... that he wanted to address in his work\nWell you know throughout his career the big the biggest issue was prejudice um rot had this this innate aversion to prejudice and he believed it was ... I Believe that all evils stem from prejudice that that's the beginning and if that's the root of all of them so he wanted to address that idea\nThat um we have this um this tendency to look to other people to uh for our own faults when we should be looking within will blame somebody else instead and that that idea came out constantly throughout the twilight zone before and after\nHe has some of the things that he wrote about of course we're pretty dramatic but what do you think has kept the twilight zone so strong all these years I mean we're talking about sixty years now\nAnd next next year will be the sixtieth anniversary of the you know the debut in Nineteen fifty nine and yeah it is you know I just recently there was a magazine was released um science fiction magazine that but it it was ranking the top one hundred\nTelevision series of all time and it wasn't just science fiction as all television series and the only black and white TV series on the cover was the twilight zone is the only the only one who made it and at this point\nYou know you ask the average twenty five year old they're not getting a Matty black and white TV series but they know what the twilight zone is it's ...\nJust as a term you know people know that\nThe twilight zone means what you think it means it means something is off kilter something is strange something is you know not quite right\nAnd it's lasted all this time because of of rods messages and because quite frankly just because it was it was so good you know it was just so well written so well produced so well acted a it was just a first class production from from get from\nPoint a to point the you know so so that's I think white has lasted all these years\nI've got this great letter in my office in Los Angeles from Ray Bradbury who wrote the script I sing the body electric for the twilight zone and it was one of my favorites and I it's a Bradbury had heard about it and I had written an article about it in a what we had was called the after dark newsletter\nIn a Bradbury just loved it he said this was one of the greatest things I've ever seen about ... shows and thank you so much and so he sends me this letter that I got and that's you know posted on my uh my board in my office\nBut rod didn't write all the scripts he oversaw things but he did right he had some writers like Bradbury\nSure no not listen nobody could write every script on you know a rod wrote in Ninety two of the hundred and fifty six twilight zone episode of five seed that's pretty prolific that is\nThat's ridiculous I mean nobody writes Ninety two shows in a five year five seats imperious just if you know and and at the same time he was doing other things you know so the amount that he produced it's just it's just off the charts I I'm just convinced he never slept\nYou just never slept from Nineteen fifty Nineteen Seventy five that was it [laughter] he smoked a lot though didn't he\nYeah he sure did unfortunately he was he was just addicted he was just addicted to it and maybe he got back in in the war as well um but um it was ultimately a big part of his mother's death\nUm yeah and absolutely had heart issues and that's what finally did him in you said that brought down the road to well over two hundred and fifty total scripts on some of the things he did I mean that's amazing if he wrote Ninety two twilight zones and two hundred and fifty others the total shows such crazy isn't it\nIt it really is you know when I was researching the book it it's you know this couple of things that are really really impressive it's that well first of all yeah you run Ninety two twilight zone episodes you also wrote thirty eight of the night gallery stories\nHa ha so if you know they do is that's\nA hundred and thirty scripts right there so there's a hundred and at least a hundred and twenty other things he did besides that's why it's on the night gallery\nStay with us deck we're going to take a break we'll come back and

cornfields\n[laughter] yeah they sure yet\nAnd as a matter of fact I have a little surprise for you Nicholas ... with a Billy\nHey George how are you man on the line Nick there you go\nHey bill good to talk to you good to talk to you too it's real good [laughter] it's better than talking to a dead grandmother so yeah [laughter]\nOkay ... give us the bad bad man\nOh I'm working for you now okay yeah I just need to tell you something buddy you're a bad man you're on the iPad [laughter]\nYour voice has not changed all that much at all you really are still waiting for purity to strike what can I say if you were in three twilight zone episodes right\nThree of the original and then I was in the future and and I wrote one of the UPN episodes and then we return to it's a good life with ... and my daughter lowly ana for it still a good life back in two thousand three so I kinda got sick notches on my belt when it comes to the tea zone\nAnd when you were in those episodes and they were being done was rod Serling around there was was he there\nAbsolutely I yeah I was on the set when they did is you know bumpers and intros and uh [noise] yeah he was definitely around and you know it's interesting because it's\nBaylor cast on a twilight zone so he was the only regular cast member and every time he was on the set because you know he and the producer ... account and we're really seeing kilo in charge of the vision of that show and wrestled\nControl from network hassling as much as they could uh every all the heads of all the different departments were always very happy to see a Mr Serling when he was on the set and talk to them about what was coming up in the next episode or so usually one and executive producer or creator comes onto his said you know everybody\nGets a little uptight you go\nYou know or when Alan's here [laughter] or whatever but uh I recall quite clearly that a rod Serling was on the set everybody was delighted to be around him\nDid he talk with you\nYeah yeah sure we went out for margaritas every night\nAnd yeah that's right and how old were you you're a little kid\nI was six or I was six and seven and nine\nThat somehow didn't they find you believe in these parts\n[noise] um well actually the one of the very first lead roles I did was a an episode of ... to young show that was directed by James Sheldon\nThe course Leishman played by mom and a and the director of that show brought me and for the first twilight zone James Sheldon he brought me in for a long distance call and he also directed it's a good life so having to under my belt or I guess they just you know just called me up for in praise of pets\nI Want the guy and you were you were in ... now what do you do in these days what's new\nWell a Angela car right now I've just released are novel a fantasy novel I think we talk to you about it when we were first writing in time and\nGo charge on purpose it's called the devil six revenge against and all the adversary his weapons\nWill sit yourself with Tom uh for the show OK\nYeah love to do that and I'm you know where he was thrown ancient aliens and you know I'm play on the real Dr Smith on the new lost in space so [noise] making music too\nYou know keep Billy thinks that's it you got it by George really moved me how to treat Nick\nThat I was thinking George so that was great\nHe was a ... I did run surely for you on this show you never know\n[laughter] you might be a my calling from the from the other side what inspired you to write the book about certainly\nWell I mean I became a twilight zone fanatic when I was a kid nine ten years old I was just you know ... of the show and and so that started everything and then really since then I've just uh it's been a very gradual process of becoming aware of all this other stuff that he had written a you know so much of it that was great\nAnd I I just wanted to collect all this information about all of these shows that he had written and and it was it was just surprising to me that no one had actually\nI'm dumb this type of thing where for example\nYou know there wasn't even really a complete a list of all the shows that certain rod Serling wrote that were produced or television or film believe it or not I mean every list I went to had things missing had ever had you had gaps whatever but\nSo that had never been done so the first thing I wanted to do is I wanted to know exactly what he wrote you know for his entire career that was produced in any form whatsoever so and then once I did that I just I just you know just snowball from there I wanted to give some information about these shows I wanted to present them in a way that\nYou know the reader who is never going to see a lot of these shows I mean they're not the twilight zone and not in that gallery there not been have been commercially released\nUm I wanted to give that reader an idea of what these shows were about so you know so that that was the idea behind the whole thing and then the book became you know it's part that is part you know a videographer you reference guide but it's also part biography in this part\nThe theme certainly was was dealing with and the character types that he you know that he researched and you know delved into and ...\nDid you come across anything that surprised you in your research\nI came across several things that surprised me yes I'm\nProbably the most surprising thing that I found was you may have heard of a particular shall we talked about the sponsors before and how they would you know bought up against sterling whenever he tried to do anything that was\nRemotely controversial whether there's one show that's particularly infamous\nIn that regard it's called it's called noon on doomsday it was rod Serling attempt to tell some kind of version of the Emmett Till lynching in Mississippi I'm for those who don't know him until the\nFourteen year old African American a boy who was lynched in Mississippi after allegedly whistling at a white woman\nAnd this really just\nDestroyed rod Serling she wants to sell some version of this story and Everytime he tried to he you know he\nMet resistance while I was able to find the actual first draft of this script that rod wrote before any of these um you know any of these ... you know if the fear and says came into play and there have been several\nStudies of this particular show in the evolution that it's ... from from you know the where it was initially to to what aired on on on television well but none of those studies had the actual first draft and I just luckily found the actual first draft in that surprised me because of all spoil it for you now\nIt's not all that much different than what actually aired on television so this book is going to tell you a completely different version of that\nNews on doomsday controversies story than than you've ever heard anywhere else\nNovember twenty second Nineteen sixty three president John F. Kennedy was assassinated how did that affect rod Serling\nIt or it devastated and he was um [noise] you know superficially he was a Kennedy admirer he was he agreed with his politics and he he mark Kennedy but beyond that it was just it really you know I I came across a letter that rotted written to um\nTo his ... can't say pastor but he was a Unitarian of most of his life for most of his adult life rod Serling was and he wrote a letter to one of those Unitarian a priest so to speak and and he just said how it just\nKind of it just took away his faith in humanity that something like this could happen he felt that we were in you know in a dark age in dark ages whereas something like this could happen so it really it just yeah it it it throw him for it threw him into a dark place for a little while\nAnd strangely enough what happened was the day after the assassination\nHe and William fruit that one of the producers on the twilight zone were contacted by the state department and ask to produce a film\nTo introduce Lyndon Johnson to the world while it was a document that they needed a documentary they thought you know this and we got to get something quick that we can just send to our allies and present to people so you know here's here's the new president and so rod Serling the day after the assassination when he was\nYou know depressed for sure\nFlew to Washington DC and began immediately working on this documentary to introduce President Johnson to the world\nSo he did that you've finished uh\nYeah in fact the you know the uh\nThe the people who asked him to do this I said we ... we need this in five days [laughter] and and and William fruits had listened that's not going to happen we can't we can't do it in five days but we'll do the best we possibly can and they you know as we've said before rather so prolific and he was so such a fast writer he did get through it pretty quickly and they had they had it ready\nYou know ah I I actually don't do exactly the timeframe wasn't five days but it wasn't much much longer\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rate stays locked\nBuddy of rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nRacial upheaval only about I turn thirty or six or eight months call precaution permission and conditions equal housing winter licensing office he takes animal is number three three additional conditions are exclusion may play\nFrom the justice of hearts Nobel home loan studios ... north Las Vegas ...

D. V. copies of this big aerial type and pass them around from city to city to city right now and\nThis book ... a has a picture of both Craig's on camera type and the paper copies that they made of this this this ... these three children that they passed around from city to city to city\nBench surely up and not watch than a woman says those are my three such children while those to my husband right before Gettysburg and I haven't heard from a sense\nI'm Sorry he died they go on and tell her the story that spooky enough but then Craig says Wayne\nLet's go shopping you're addict can scrounge around ... takes this is right after he gave me this book go up my addict I live in Eighteen forty house has a few books of its own right\nGo up in this attic and there's this little room where there was furniture assembled but when we bought the house ceilings are only about four foot tall it's a spooky little room it's almost like Anne Frank and her family lived\nAnd there were a bunch of artifacts left over in the house when it was purchased one of the things that was left over in the house was this book ... book of photographs\nOf Craig and I opened it up and there is one of the C. D. V. copies of the the same three children we opened it up and immediately there's those three kids staring right at us we dropped the book industry [laughter]\nI mean that's what kind of coincidences at right now it's almost like that conjured up something pretty doggone spooky\nI guess you got to be careful with what you do\n[noise] well you know I don't think careful I think that the positive things about antiques as they bring about good spirits a lot of happiness but there are times when you got to\nPay a little bit careful I knew the warns pretty well and they are used to say don't play around with a weed gee boards and stuff and I ... I Believe that\nYeah yeah I don't mess around with really chilly and takes but because you know you don't want to open up doors you can't close right [laughter]\nThat's true that is absolutely ... when when you do your rummaging and you've been to some of these older places and you find some of these things have you found objects that look scary to you\nAll the time it's often um ... the the things that that make them look scary is the houses that are in um [noise] I was in a house where this famous psychologist or\nA dyed in the story was that he killed themself and uh I go through there with my buddy another buddy of mine who were doing\nA an appraisal is this for a for some lawyers and and and we're taking photographs of these pieces and this guy had spray painted things on the walls that were really strange he was a LSD person\nIn the house was filled with all sorts of strange uh furniture from the mission oak period nothing had been cleaned or in years and\nHe had like captured animals and skin them and made things out of them\nUm that was pretty scary when you're the first one to come across these things over the years and that that tends to make all the objects in the house all the scarier so I'm going through this house taking photographs of all the strange things right\nMy buddy won't go up in the addict I Know what's wrong with you because wind there's something wrong\nThere what are you talking about it 'cause I saw something up there I saw goes up there\nI said come on that we're working here right it's not time for this right we've got a lot to

you sold it\nI saw that I have a a one in fat not talk about it takes a thought I was a visiting a apartment complex or an old man was throwing stuff away somebody came and got me they said wait this guy's daughter\nCould stop it does it you know what he has a lot of money for what he was thrown away one of the things that really talk to me was is that I couldn't hardly see it it was a young boy

when\nHe came back into power\nYeah I remember Holly so last year from Ethiopia of course what would that be worth anything going\nWell for instance so Brian is not a name that I'm close to a doesn't stick out\nIt doesn't stick out I'm I'm looking it up as we talk right now and I don't find anything [noise] um the fact that it goes back to Eisenhower's period though and it's Ethiopian is a is a really good um uh aspect of it\nAnd um my guess is if it's painted with a lot of a good subject matter interests it probably worth some decent money\nWhen I'm On a picture of like George Patton or something like that would that be worth\nA lot of money because George Patton was such an interesting fellow George Patton was you know they made a great movie about um [noise] and uh you know it was just he was just a guy who stood out I'd love to have is a girl and all this ...\nOh my gosh that would be worth ... wouldn't that be something I\nSure would also didn't have like a ... not not a chain but he walked with something um that had like a little leather strap at the end of it or something like\nThat yeah I kind of carried a little like you know the white people whip a horse yeah

Jordan currencies\nUm they're actually a series of variations books made of purely of lead which is a really bizarre I'm quite unexpectedly discovered back in two thousand seven and they were found in caves you know the job\nThat they they range in size from being the noble sort of pay back size three quite small um and they're all well mostly sealed with with by the way which rules say\nQuite a bit of control and say well why is it so uncommon especially being that old them using lead\nWell um that's a good question because I remember the very day\nThat something very rare happened and that was that when we start solving cared to seize um we had some very you know blow definition photographs send to us and looking at the Michael have so it made of leather relatives the ledge um but it was only off towards that so I was told that were made of lead\nWe had it to analyze and age for purity and\nIt's it's really very interesting I mean the analysis itself is is a fascination process but however I wanted to see sort of see anything else like this that have been discovered\nI went to the Palestine expression library in London to look for lead books could find anything I went in there and everywhere else couldn't find everything on the the the rare occurrence was doing a Google Search and putting into Google let books and coming up with nothing\nI said this is what makes them pretty unique uh and and very very remarkable\nAnd of course back then they had no idea of damage that led would cost or human humans dealing with it like that\nNo absolutely I mean the the Romans um I mean we will hear stories of the revenue in prison how\nHow bad they will uh um what we've gotta give leeway to is the fact that quite often they would drink a great Sarah with that that that that food and this grapes there would be produced over pad by being boiled down in lead hawks\nAre leading to well in the case or can they get a severe disturbance\nDavid um the the ... issues were discovered in two thousand seven what was what was the what was the circumstances of their discovery\nYeah we were contacted by an Israeli veteran who said that he had a number of these things we we kind of long story short we made inquiries we asked him to send a sample of the the the the led\n'em over to us so we can investigation we sent it onto a a university\nAnd the ... tree base it Oxford and initial now says a in a steady written report states it that it was consistent with Roman Providence and origin\nSo we read I said at that point then we could really goes to the ad perhaps investigates um you know the script and and then start to discuss this with with the eminent academics\nAnd when we look to the scripts I could see it was a kind of Middle Eastern paleo Hebrew type a script\nA but of course I Know that he likes that so I Need you to go to others to um see will they felt about it\nJudaism and the rise of Islam of very intimate and I'm very very proud of the fact that we have the support of a large majority of the Muslim population in the middle east particularly enjoy\nIn supporting dialogue and investigation of these lakes which I think in today's world\nIs incredibly important because\nUnfortunately there's so much fear surrounding Islam or Christianity or Judaism in terms of the way people get very passionate in in in their arguments about which is the best of the three they've touched them more or less you know they come from the same origins that they are more or less if you think about it\nAt a base level the same\nBut it almost sounds like they don't wear most most people warm most the start out there is much get back to our roots it almost sounds like they're trying to avoid getting back to\nTheir roots absolutely you bet your bottom dollar\nOn and this is the issue um we've been working with a lot of evidence scholars who have investigated the a ... in terms of script and in terms of the makeup of the mess all looking at its corrosion and looking at the translation of the ...\nAnd these are very eminent people who have kept asylum council enough just continue to work quite late in the background\nAnd these are very while these people you actually have decided that get you get to know the code to seize before they come to that conclusion they see is extremely important because those voices that have come out and said oh that steak like steak I've known any been discredited that they have\nStream the important because those voices that have come out and said oh that fake fake like\nI've known anybody discredited that they have never once on to the question and that is where is your peer review paper where is your published data showing that these are like they could save a they've produced absolutely nothing well\nWhat is their fear of these things coming out what are they trying to hide from back then and where where's that transition that took place where all of a sudden now they're they're this new wave and they're trying to keep the real information or the or the original information away from the public\nWhat it was really weird when we made the announcement on BBC News twenty four back in two thousand eleven the um the discovery was greeted with largely with a claim and with with or fascination by everyone\nAnd we were very careful to make fuel that we posted a few ideas but to make sure that people use our ideas because we will still investigating walk these things uh\nUm but almost from the outset the the fundamentalists the fanatics the ... the voices to or perhaps envious of the discovery said no no no no these are fake fake fake\n... that the critical point that to add a eight days off we made the announcement when an Oxford professor Peter tighten the man who also happens to be a devout Catholic denounced the disease as tourists that\nI Need based is appalling absolutely no taste whatsoever bought one very low resolution image I sent an eight months before\nTo um get his opinions on that the the translation of some Greek lecturing off the top of the ...\nIt was a ... we had never actually had physical access to their pitch to be made of corporate or wrongs or we weren't sure about it I told him about the team involved I told them had some very very eminent people engulfed including a couple of leaders of the the ... girls team\nAnd still he said you would stake his reputation on them being fakes\nWell I'm afraid to say they've been shown to be the real McCoy now and we'll wait to see what he is getting to do next\nWhen they were introduced to you David what was your initial impression um were you skeptical or did you see them and and I'm just have a sense right away that these were going to end up being legitimate\nThat's a good question actually um I Know exactly what you mean when when you when you when you states it that way\nWhen I first saw the images of the uh as I said they were low residents images and so of course it was very difficult to make time outs whether they were made of leather or something else I thought they were made of leather on that point I was suspicious because I thought oh here we go again you know antiquities in the middle east it's quite a trade you know\nUh and that for older anti Christ will be copied\nSo in other words to say something up you've got to copy it\nIf these were fakes than what were they copies off because when I found out that were made purely of lead\nSuddenly my interests which provoked and it's when I looked at the Scripps that I realized it was more than possible that these things where the real McCoy and I did have an innocence that these things were that were exactly that they were real they ...\nThat of course I couldn't advertise that I actually had to then take the next steps along with Dennis the to actually show these two academics go them to the bar trees and see what they thought and that's been a fascinating question itself\nWe for winter break you were actually I'm telling us about um\nThe what they thought and that's been a fascinating question itself\nWe for winter break you were actually I'm telling us about um you know kind of the discovery of the documents if we can use that word and yet I think you were starting to say they would be difficult to be forged because of and that's when we had to cut you off\n[laughter] yeah well I'm the latest um so the by those in opposition to them is that okay fine we accept that the lead is is agents but however it's been repeat and in modern times to produce these things\nWell I'm afraid to say that quite wrong on that one too\nIf you look at these things microscopic day\nYou will see that there are impurities lynching out of the natural matrix or approaches that takes anything between two thousand years an Eighteen hundred years according to a\nSenior analyst is a hammer had beaten the surface of the lead those um the crystals would have been knocked out and you would see ... on the surface of the mess all\nThere is none of them all the impurities are scattered all over the whole of the service of the books including the lecturing the iconography\nSo disconnected mean one thing that they will not repeat in multiple times they are actually covered in oil is an extraordinary types of of impurities we've got things like perhaps potassium\n... for instance which is very rare in crystalline form\nVarious other elements that are reaching out we've got a you know let that is very impure it sort of thing like a snack and an end to many and\nA new name it until the very low silver content we think so that was extracted I'm at origin and it's a robot levels which is another pointed to them coming from that period\nBut we're we're undertaking felt the corrosion research as a at a microscopic a macroscopic level and where we're seeing even more extraordinary I'm a aspects of the corrosion\nEr which are a demonstration great great age\nSo what are the naysayers scared of what are they trying to hide what are they trying to keep quiet\nI think that they want the idea of Jesus as literally as seen in the that the gospels of the New Testament to be you know to be just that they don't want their garnished view of the Lord Jesus Christ to be an changed\nIt was a guy who was able to feed five thousand people with a less than a few fishes you could walk on water\nAnd I don't want to be offensive but he comes across in their view a bit like a marvel comics superhero carrots or the ... tell us that actually he was human and he was a human you actually had a divine experience\nAnd this is critical because you know as a lot of non Christians would off can stick to the atheists how can a man be God and how can a garbage man\nI'm In in terms of logical progression of the argument the of the ... have a lot to offer us\nBut the the issue here is that you know there are a gospels that are not comical that will not I'm officially accepted by the charge\nAt the council of nice the uh industry twenty five a day I'm and I'm you know these are not stick golf balls that sometimes dismissed as that you've got the gospel to fit the gospel of piece of the Gulf with Mary and you name it but you know actually I saw\nSchools that sometimes dismissed as batch you've got the gospel to fit the gospel of peace with the Gulf with Mary you name it but you know actually I saw these were written by people who had their view all of the Christian beliefs\nAnd and I think the critical factor here is that actually these were members of a a um you know a a a series of group of individuals who wasn't necessary part of a movement\nAnd each one ... movement became officially sanctioned by the Roman empire that suddenly you end up with the eulogy that actually takes the Roman line um the gospels of goals a post date the the ... so the ... kind of giving a chapter on the on the truth\nThey owe the earliest known I'm the only exist and a Hebrew Christian documents so they date back from before that period so of course they take things right back to the very ancient origins of Christianity and their revealing secrets which I think they're going to be very very interesting indeed", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "17"}
