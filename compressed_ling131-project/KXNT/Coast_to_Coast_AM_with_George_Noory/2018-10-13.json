Jeffrey seal and back with us internationally recognized professionals psychic\nExorcist teacher specializes in the clearing of individuals' homes businesses and psychic protection Jeffrey is also an expert on Huntington homes and businesses psychic ability good go such as spirit guide as well and we tonight we're going to talk about demonic spirits Jeffrey welcome back\nThanks jurors for having me back on your show the fifth time a in a big hello everybody around are beautiful planets\nSoup or you know this is a great time of year Halloween just brings out a lot of things with people but it seems to also bring up ghosts and spirits and strange things doesn't it do you feel that way\nI think that\nIndividuals and the media a lot more attention to it certainly the time we think about all things supernatural a good and evil\nAh also a tradition that um it's harvest time and a and the truth tradition of that that\nThere's a veil of energy that seems to be thin or this time of year\nUh I I've found that to be somewhat true but the thing is\nThat I deal with half and all the time and um but the media pays more attention to it this time of year\nAnd that's fine anytime we talk about it and get a chance to inform the public on what is really happening around our world and also on the other side I think is really important\nDo you ever do you think demonic spirits and we'll get into what do you think they are but do you think they affect people to the point where strange things are happening like now I mean I I feel people are tense uptight\nAnd yeah you know kind of angry about certain things do you think demonic spirits ... something to do with that\nDefinitely ah we are certainly going through a lot of changes right now on the planet earth\nAnd this is a huge target for demonic spirits and also negative spirits and I'll get into the difference between those two are as we go along but absolutely targets on the back of people that have power\nAnd can change the world for good or for ill\nAnd uh I think that there's never been a time in our history\nWhere demons have a greater opportunity to strike at the common person and also people who are very influential and so they're around more than ever\nI think so too so let's get you take Jeffrey ... is a demonic spirit in European\nDemonic spirit is a very very powerful spirit it could be said that there was a counter part of angels\nThat powerful they are not regular people who have died and just have a bad attitude into negative things they've been around for a long time they're very involved and may have not ever lived in the physical realm\nOr not have lived in the physical realm for a long time they're very powerful and they are known to be able to affect physical reality and also the minds of individuals' a very easily and ah we're not looking\nOut for it you know we don't protect ourselves properly and we're taught that it's something a from Hollywood movies and it only happens to a few people it's not going to happen to me but that's not true because I get calls every day from people that\nAre under the attack of ah demonic spirits\nNegative spirits and ah demonic spirits are are able to reach in to the physical round from the non physical route and actually\nPhysical effects and that is one difference between a a demonic spirit in a negative spirit also demonic spirits are are much better\nEquipped to ah influence people\nOn a psychological emotional level meaning that they can stand right next to us and we can't see them and tell a path ethically trends for information into our system or emotional systems make us angry at each other\nThe other people at ourselves get us to do things we would not normally do and we can see them we don't know that there are there\nShe that's what I think is happening now know are they the biblical version of fallen angels\nThey can be certainly that many\nDemonic spirits are ones were good and there's such a thing as you go I Want to sit on your show that ego is the killer of The Exorcist yup and it's also true of spirits it's also true that demonic spirits a can change you know once\nThey were you know positive spirits and their ego got to them and now that they're doing very very negative things and uh the real danger that I see is that uh there are we're we're more susceptible than ever before to attack\nA so many arguments you know between people today and they take advantage of that and spirits and all spirits do not have voice boxes they communicate George ... ethically and we all communicate\n... kind of like a river that travels underneath our consciousness and they communicate on that level\nTo us maybe at night maybe in a day maybe when people are intoxicated when people step out something steps in that's also very common and uh they try to get us to do things that we would not normally do\nViolence things hurt our significant others wives husbands people are not all a violent acts are due to are caused by demonic spirits\nBut they certainly are around and they are around more than ever and sort negative spirits people who are dead\nAnd they were doing negative thing is when they were alive and continue to do negative things but demonic spirits are very powerful and it's an exorcist when I'm dealing with demonic spirits I have to be very careful because many of them are more powerful than me\nThat's right that's what they can they can come and get you\nOwe apps and they do and the thing is is that they come when you least expect it when I'm working I'm really looking for it when I'm helping people deal with negative things in their homes and get a feelings negative energy is\nI'm looking for it it's when I'm not looking forward to a vet the attacks on me or hurt it doesn't happen very often I've been doing this work\nSeven years now but it does happen and so I've been attacked a success if you times for short duration and it's very unpleasant and it happens very quickly demonic spirits are able to assume any shape or form\nAt a moment's notice can you see them I can you see I was born\nWith the ability to see spirit I thought everybody could\nIt was shocking to me George when I when I was young in in elementary school and grade school I thought I saw spirits in the classroom\nSome were standing over students and essentially trying to help them with their homework and help them with school work and some are looking at me like how can you see me\nWhat are you doing I don't like this and these are the one I had to watch out for and they actually come and started walking towards me in the classroom and I was very uncomfortable\nAll right stay with us Jeffrey we're going to get a break and we're going to come back and talk more about these demonic

too yeah on K eggs anti\nJeffrey ... with us as we talk about demons we'll take calls next to our as well before we get into open lines Jeffrey what do you think they're in game is what do they want these demons\nThe destruction of the human race a\nNatural human humans they want\nOver the years and said I can control spirits I can control demons but it's not true they have nothing that we want and so are they attack\nChildren in their cribs ... attack people at work\nThe attack everybody we all have targets on her back and we need to realize that\nUh we can't see them but they can see us degenerate negative emotional energies they generate hatred and they're all around and they're using this time of uncertainty in our world today\nIn order to amplify are negative feelings towards each other and it's very important to understand\nWhat they're trying to do they don't want us to know that there were there they want us to think that it's a Hollywood myth or something like that Hollywood makes movies no problem with that but the reality is is that they are around the spirits are around us all the time\nWe just can't see them and they communicated with us ... either end game is to destroy us to destroy the fabric of the family\nTo destroy businesses reason being is that that's how we make our money destroy your business and you destroy a person's ability to make money destroyed their family destroy their lives\nAnd also check to change or the way we think about each other\nRight now they have us at each other's throats right where they wanna sell they sure do and we have to stop it and there's there's ways to stop it you know and that's what I Do and I teach people how to stop\nWell do you have to realize that they're doing this to us as opposed to people saying it's just the human race it's all screwed up\nEverybody has a story\nEverybody I've talked to has some kind of story of uh being in a home apartment condo a party a part in a pub any ... any place\nWhere they've seen or felt something strange they're picking up on negative emotional energy something that living humans generate we all generate on a non physical level emotional energy and so do spirits and they generate huge amounts of emotional energy and that can\nInfluence this by essentially getting into our energy fields are emotional systems and amplifying our feelings\nSo it takes us from being sort of angry into complete road rage where we do things that we would\nNormally do how many times that people said that I Would not normally do that and some of them were angry that's when they attack important people making decisions around our world they work on them\nOr they do know that there are there and they may not leaving them but they are there you know most people believe in some kind of life after death some something that happens not everybody but most people do so what happens\nWhen we simply drop or physical bodies and become non physical entity is their spirits most people are good summer not most spirits are good summer not\nAnd so the ones that are not have a tendency to want to continue\nTo hang around our world and get us to do things he would not normally do demonic spirits are\nJust experts added they have weapons they have devices that they make a lot of non physical energy is just like spirits do spirits change their forms\nLike our our parents die and it's an old age or something they can immediately change and look younger by gender reading and thinking about generating\nA form of what they want it to look like and also generating close 'cause most people do not see\nNaked spirit so all these things are generated on a non physical level emotional energy is generated on a non physical level as well so demonic spirits come close to us or even from a distance and focus in on us and generate hatred and rage\nWe think it's our own\nBut it's not always completely our own\nOr the under the direction of the double Jeffrey\nI'm not sure if there's one particular\nSpirit in charge of all negative spirits I demonic spirits are kind of like criminals\nThey really don't even get along with each other\nThey don't trust each other they most often work alone but that's not always rule\nUh they do working groups I have found that to be true and all the decades I've been doing this\nUp but they really do their best when they work alone and they take their time\nWorking on individuals and families getting them to fight uh getting people to fight with each other and getting countries to fight with each other getting people to amplify what would normally be a small amount of anger into complete rage\nAnd very very good at it because the amount of anger that comes out of them\nIs incredible and we just don't see it coming on I Know that when I've been attacked personally uh it happened so quickly one moment I see them next moment you know some kind of very negative\nA beam of light all come out on an attack I pull out my non physical sword they pull out their weapons and there is a fight going on\nBut everybody's not so fortunate that they can see them and know that they're coming\nAnd so there are around us and we don't know it around just working at home also negative spirit you know and negative spirits can work for them essentially\nAnd and sort of modeled themselves after that and like I said most people are good and some are not and the ones that are not are also quite capable of doing the very same thing generating hatred and anger and of course millions of people die\nAll the time and lots of them are not good uh they were not good when they were living and they continue to do negative things and they attacked people on a daily basis so essentially the entire human race right now is under attack\nBy negative spirits and uh unfortunately demonic spirits which are very very powerful spirits and like I said earlier may not have ever lived in the physical round\nOr for a very very long time and they're they they practice and they're good at what they do they know how to generate hatred enraged and they know how to get it through our natural protection systems also known as the aura and to get us to react\nTo they're angry and hateful feelings and they have no problem they would essentially\nKill a child in the cradle it no problem with that I Know that's a scary thought\nIt was horrible and they have they just hate humans and so they attack everybody they attack people least able to defend themselves and then our world right now we're having a lot of changes going on in a

I've called you a couple of times about turmeric and everything else but Jeffrey you treat me extremely a great late at night\nQuestions I have some issues I didn't catch the beginning of the program and I'm not sure where you're from but I Am a up in Minnesota and\nI have had a problem I created when I was back in the marine corps a prior to the war um after I went through that\nWhat happened after we'd you board followed me as it said it would\nAnd I've lost two families or Twenty years worth of families I I'm a dedicated man\nAnd I'm at the bottom of the barrel at the moment and I've tried cleansing my house with age and everything else um I mean I've I've I've done everything I've talked to some of the the best people George has had on his show I mean\nAnd I'm I'm not getting anywhere you have any recommendations that I might not have heard of yet\nWell definitely give me a a call or email me certainly sage loosened up emotional energy it loses up negative emotional energy soldiers Franken sense coal poll there's many substances that work very very well loosening up\nEnergy is kind of like spring something on the wall to get something off of it\nDoes in the long run of the home see that's the problem is is that the age will release it you know out into the atmosphere but it will not remove it from your home will not removed from your living environment it has to be actually\nPushed down into the earth and away from the property in order for it to be removed because essentially what I think it's going on here to Jay has he been releasing it by doing these you know really positive things stage\nFrankenstein as all of these things you know I recommend them certainly but where it releasing them into the atmosphere they still have to be released from and pushed out from the home in order for them to be out of your life and I think it was going on is that is just accumulated\nA to the point where it's all around you and you're doing everything you can but now it needs to be forcibly pushed out of your home and this is where a lot of people have issues you know they do things you know that they they learn on the Internet or from you know qualified people that actually work\nAnd to some extent\nBut emotional energy and negatives there isn't all of these things need to be forcibly removed from the home so it's kind of like you know taking the Bruins pushing it all the dust into the center of the room we still have to take a dust pan\nYet the you know a broom and and get it in the dust pan into the garbage has got to go into the garbage and that's what's not happening\nAll right thanks for them now tell us a little bit about what is exactly negative emotional energy Jeffrey\nPeople generate both positive and a ... a negative emotional energy is from the very first day that were born shortage\nAnd these things can become trapped in our bodies energy fields also known as the aura but the or is not just a bunch of pretty lights it is who we are it's part of who we are a personality are our emotional systems\nHave an energy field that extends out from the very center of our non physical body which is our spirit or maybe three or four feet\nOutside of our physical body and emotional energy can become trapped over a period of time in just about everybody everybody has the issue\nSo emotional energy that's negative\nTrapped in our bodies energy fields and we can also pick it up in any kind of store restaurant somebody's home I'm watching a television\nUh you know a pub Z every place there is emotional energy and our bodies energy fields have we don't protect ourselves\nAnd most people don't that it actually permeates into our energy field and mixes with our own emotional energy\nPositive and negative and causes habits and this is one of the biggest problems that people who call me have it's not it was just demonic spirits the idea is is that we are filled full of emotional energy not a positive energy I don't touch I'm not even capable of doing that we\nOnly let go of what we want to let go\nAnd so I deal with essentially clearing out the negative emotional energy negative emotional energy is something that uh people want to release\nI feel a hundred percent better when it's natural let's go to Terry in Houston, Texas welcome to the show ...\n... ah yeah George or ideas what I'm a even as the original language or the scriptures and I'm actually writing a book called that we really know about it\nAnd I know he's a Bible in Nineteen eighty yeah I've dealt with a lot of the party a scene and I was going to ask you Jeffrey are you a Christian\nI don't belong to the Christian religion I Do believe in God\nI also think that ah the argument over creationist a series and a true scientific physical theories is ridiculous\nThe poll work hand in hand first prince will is creation spirits don't just sit around and clouds and do and do nothing higher spirits angels God you know they create almost like a bad or of a cake\nA non physical level the design of the universe\nAnd then comes the physical so the non physical\nProceeds the physical so the idea that you know creation is does that happen is the universe created absolutely but also the big bang theory why not so it's essentially like I said like baking a cake you know the spirits God angels are in the business\nOr in a wonderful business of actually creating an designing these things perpetually right now as we speak not just in the beginning of time but right now and that filters out it's connected with the physical all things physical so each person has to levels\nOf physical body which is very finite sixty eighty years or Fifteen Years or whatever and our spirit which is completely internal\nEnter personality which never dies and and I'm really amazed at the argument that are not that you have but I mean that is\nBeing fostered out there between religion and scientists which I agree with I'm I Am a non physical scientist essentially so I Believe in all of this is science to me\nYou know and I think that you know God has a personality\nYou know whether there was one or two I don't know I'm not sure you know but I Do believe that there I Know there are higher spirits are there because I work with them and I work for them and so I Do believe you know I worked for Christians all the time and I respect that religion\nAnd so I you know I think when you're doing this marvelous you know I think that it's just that there's a misinterpretation in need\nGive it between these two are theories that are both correct\nAnd let's go back to refer other question go ahead Teri\nUh yeah what I was going to say is you're talking about religion religion teaches that ... that God go to church give your money you this do do that that's not from guy\nThe problem is is that we have many ministers out there that teach\nUh this type of stuff then basically do they make money off of God the problem is with the with the whole scenario as it turns people off like you Jeffrey and and I understand that I I really do understand that and I feel sorry for people that don't know that\nBut you've got to understand that the only Christianity is not a religion if it if it's a relationship between you and God now why is that\nWell to be an arbitrator you have to be God man Jesus title is genes is its Lord Jesus Christ lord and have the genes this means humanity in crisis means anointed why [noise]\nOkay so what happens is because we don't do this in order to be because none of us are perfect on the surface in fact in fact Peter said that I'm a I I that God is no respect or a person but we're all in the same boat\nNo matter how much knowledge we know we're all in the same boat with God\nBecause we have is it nature because where where warning stand because of Adam's then because we carry out and then uh our entire life we we are and and even all that there's that that none of us are the glory of God we were all in the same boat\nBut those demons seemed to be every where we're going to come back and take funnel calls in a moment on the coast to coast am\nGhost insiders the new version of the coast to

California is with us say Thomas\nCharge thank you for taking my call sir and Jeffrey great work that you're doing ... my questioning\nAbout war and the battle field and war zones how does\nMilitary personnel men and women\nIn a battle situation protect themselves from the Monica phone I'm not talking about\nJust battling insurgents physically but there must be a lot of demonic energies in a war time battle field situation\nAnd you have any advice for men and women in the military to protect themselves\nI Do I was in the air force myself many years ago um and especially there are ... there are rules on the other side\nOf motion all energy that we all generate and and as a in the battlefield hatred and anger and fear and there's killing going on and so it certainly is a a place for negative for sort of tracked into demonic spirits negative stairs as well terrible things are happening\nAnd so we need to build up in\nThere are methods there are rules on the other side like there are physical rules so there are things we can do in order to build shields around ourselves to protect us from the effects\nThat negative energy that is generated by other people fear around us were just natural and the battle situation\nUh emotional energy that's just you know so intense on the battlefield there are multiple layers that can be applied that actually work so that negative energy actually bounces off of us\nThis is something I teach people to do every day it's very important and so it's not you know uh you know just about me the idea is is that yes there are lots of things that people can do on the battlefield to protect themselves in the military\nYou just have to learn how to do them they're actually very simple and it can you know take the stuff I designed over the years\nWith the help of my spirit guides can be brought up in five or ten seconds\nYou need it fast you know the old style was doing things ten minutes in the morning in ten minutes in the evening I read all that stuff when I got out of the service ten minutes in the morning and ten minutes in the evening\nBut we need it's very different now it's very different we you know we need we need protection right away we don't know when things are going to hit us we need to be able to bring up our protection systems immediately\nIn order to deflect negative emotional energy of this being generated by the enemy by people around us are that are unhappy and are frightened and also by spirits that are trying to interfere\nAnd feed off of the killing and and also also uh off the fear\nAnd you're so I think that it's very important that we all learn that this kind of thing and it's a science it's not a religion what I what I'm involved in\nIs not religion I Would not even to say it's really a metaphysical it's non physical science\nI have no problem with physical science I agree with everything that they have to say\nScientists do not call me up and to argue with me they are right ideals non physical science which is essentially is the non physical part of our body are emotional systems are personality everything else butter physical body that is susceptible to attack\nAnd also negative emotional energy by negative spirits demonic spirits and also people and really bad and scary situations\nHave you seen demons attack businesses and why did they do that\nThey do it in order to destroy\nA person's life hack the fabric of the family and the best way to do it is to pull out\nThe resources money George to get it out if they destroy your business and they have a two fold thing going on and they have people that are fired that have to look for a job it can cause arguments at home it can cause people to lose their place\nOr where they live all sorts of problems that can cause them to feel bad and actually react\nSometimes violently and also it has an effect upon the actual business environment where now you have a failed business I think most restaurants they fail
