I mean I don't know if I classify shining as a slasher\nUm but it's certainly a horror film and and and and ... and ... and a and a good one and I think it's what I mean forty years old or something now right you know these these are these modern horror films are pretty hire a you know the ring is Twenty years old you know so um [noise] you know it's a\nYou know a lot of them are are are ah you know whoa hold up pretty well um with age and I I really I think a Halloween the first Pauline\nIs really a a pretty suspenseful movie and Donald pleasant is really excellent as kind of like the captain Ahab trying to\nStop this uh you know maniacal a killer actually not even maniacal that someone from Nineteen Seventy eight man\nNineteen Seventy eight is this a forty year anniversary of the original Halloween imagine it's been that long like gosh uh and John Carpenter who of course ah gave us a the remake of the ... and skiing from your Kim a bunch of other uh\nOr or films a science fiction\nHeat of the original concept was that it was going to be an anthology is that every Halloween they would do a different theme or different type of scary movie and the first story was called the babysitter killers and and there was a baby sitter killer a and that was the ... that was the Michael Meyers story\nTo kick them and uh the character became so popular um the mask he's wearing they were trying to come up with a scary math and and what they ended up doing was taking a William Shatner Star Trek math in spray painting it white\n[laughter]\nSo that's ... that's a lawyer Shatner Matt Good Larry I'm\nI Wonder how I built feels about that\nYeah I don't know uh but uh you know ... and so what you know it's the fact that it puts a blank you know expression on the mask and and and not deliberately scary face a you know I think that that made it more uh more scary you know I think a lot of times they are\nNewer movies they try to heart you're talking about the conjuring and some of 'em they're a family of films there's an of bell which uh\nKnow the original dolled up the Warren\nAre having their a basement full of an\nObject is Iraq at the end all we all know what raggedy and looks like and the one that they hand ended up doing in the movie they tried to make it look scary a it looks like something out of spirit Halloween you know and and it's just\nIt's it's a you know it no one would trust the stalled for two seconds you know they're like oh what a beautiful dog with its like horrific looking right off the back you know it much scarier when it's something you least expect you know no one would think that that there are little ... gonna\nGonna try to possess them or ... birthday\nComing up on fifty years Rosemary's Baby can you believe that started early that either and that's been ... to she was just almost a kid when she started in that movie\nShe was she was you know and that was kind of seen as she got kind of a controversial sort of a mob look with short hair\nRight she ... proteges and that is true that didn't last too long but you're right\nYou know and and uh you know a William Castle wanted to make that move you know William Castle was the producer\nOf course in the fifties was famous for his gimmicks you know all like emerge Joe and uh you know I always feel with the ... and the seats and the uh\nUh you know all of these uh movie gimmicks\nOf a house on haunted hill and uh um you know straight jak classics\nHold on for a second Mr ... we're in a break we'll come back with more next our phone calls you will share your movie experience with Mr ... later on on the coast to coast they\nShaking with year I'd have to go into the other room I was the kind of kid that when the skipper we yell at Gilligan during Gilligan's Island\nI Would have to get out of the room\nYou know it was a little too little too hot when skipper with yoga and whether it's ... you know and we were watching\nMy dad and I think with a lot of movies that bonding thing you know fathers son\nKind I'm the same way I was going to talk about that and I I Will but you're exactly right\nAnd and I think it kind of a rite of passage you know and and I think originally I was watching these movies to kind of be with my dad and he would be in the recliner watching creature features and I'd be next to him or hiding behind the recliner sometime\nAnd you know\nIt ... I think it was maybe I don't know if it was crawling hand or just the hand but they have this very convincing hand to crawl it's embodied hand crawling by itself\nAnd I and I'm ... I'm ... and it bothered me so much to my dad's ... you know if the rubber hand that face filled with great jelly and you know are manipulating with wires and ... and I'm\nSure his explanation was dead wrong but but it put into this perspective a wait there this is fun time they're playing\nIs a show this is this is this is this is a game you know this is something can make a this is something to just the torture me this is this is something for fun\nAnd I think if it was kind of an a ha kind of moment and I think from that point forward\nOr I couldn't get enough you know I was a highway or if it were ... and not just for all of your horror I feel is is that under horror an five five I think are under the bigger a well a fantasy though uh\nI think the horror or is it an offshoot of fantasy and so it's ... I like all of that I like a John or movies I like a you know monsters and a robot and injured and pirates and all\nMy dad used to bring me God rest his soul to all these movies when I was a kid I I remember him taking me to see the ... when I was seven years old Mr long oh yeah and then of course the scary one for me\nI knew all the house on the haunted hill than when the original one with Vincent Price\nRight I mean how so how do I want a blind woman and the seller man I thought\nHe would bring me to all these movies I don't know if he brought me because my mom didn't want to go for [laughter]\nWell when you just wanted me around but\nI mean all these all these movies he would bring me too\nYeah and then the the TV shows he would love to see science fiction theater in in ... in those kinds of shows right you know you'd have them on all the time I I think he's one of the reasons why my mother is one of the reasons why I got into broadcasting and I'm you know indoor UFOs and the paranormal\nBut my dad got me into these movies and all these science fiction shows he loved those things\nWell sure you know and all of those and I think it all ties together you know because I think that curiosity you know I'm just the fact like just like a like a show like Star Trek my you know kind of brought us the cell phones and and uh you know all sorts of thing\nYou know I think that that the curiosity for this a cult in the supernatural you know I think it is probably the genesis or the Steve although a lot of um your your guest on your show who started watching these uh\nMovies in and decided to go hey let's dig deeper what you know are there goes let's find out\nI think so too what do you think of the Texas Chainsaw massacre Nineteen Seventy four version\nYou know the the Texas Chainsaw massacre gets has had the heaviest wrap everyone was trying to do the Texas Chainsaw massacre there is hardly a drop of blood in that whole movie\nYou think there is you think there is and I think the ... right\nYou know and you go back and watch it and you know it's all filmed murky sixteen millimeter and it's the chainsaw and the the how weird their house was with all the the mode mobiles made out of bones and you know the the psychological aspect is really what clicked with that movie and I think that everyone that what came after it\nThose were really I think they're really sloppy slap dash you know a bunch of teenagers waiting to get slaughtered kind of movies but really as the original Texas Chainsaw they were they were they were heartbroken when they got an R rating they were trying to get a PG E because there was no one was going to go see it\nThe Nineteen sixty Alfred Hitchcock movie psycho Lou shower scene you would think you were looking at ... moons every second not one to ... did you see in that shower saying\nNo no no point does the knife a entered Janet Leigh body at any point uh you\nYou are you there you know it's happening but you don't see\nThat the sounds I think out a lot of that and there were a bunch of other ... there were a bunch of melon that they had laid out and they were stabbing different types of melons\nAnd Hitchcock is getting her ... watching the sound guy\nKnow making all these weird hollow strange down having all these different fruits and vegetables [laughter] ... let's say a word and asked me to walk out the door he just says her father\n[laughter] Blair Witch project started with pennies but that was a scary one to\nBlair Witch project is really interesting because you know a a you know there were a unfortunately I had a friend who was ushered when a when that movie came out and he was cleaning up bomb it\nEvery single night\nYou couldn't handle it because ... and it wasn't because it was scary it was because people hadn't had become accustomed to the found footage first person you know just a just a handy cam or a camcorder filming a whole movie\nUh you know that was kind of the first of the sort of found footage types film\nAnd an independent film that went really big and you know and it's like okay well you can say what you want about that movie but\nYou know that in that movie was a that was the director had final caught and they made the movie they way the way they wanted to make it and they created this whole legend that much more I mean I live in Pennsylvania not far from a where the Blair Witch supposed to happen and people still\nDrive in they're looking to uncover this thing that never happened so they really really great job of not only are making a a a found footage film but but\nCreating a a a a story that people want it to believe in and uh you know it's so nowadays I think that would be hard to do because of the Internet it just you can't keep a secret for twenty second but in Nineteen Ninety nine a food everybody everyone thought the Blair Witch was the thing\nWhen did you think of Freddie Krueger nightmare on elm street\nYou know it's interesting I didn't like it when I saw it originally uh you know it just it was kinda just greedy and\nCame out in Nineteen eighty four right\nEighty four but you know I I've gone back and there's a lot of humor in it and and it's very marriage that said you know he's not just stabbing people going into their dreams\nUh which I think they pretty liberally ripped off from the movie dream scape which I came in the year before which is an excellent movie that people should seek out where someone is trying to assassinate the president inside of his dream right uh but uh yeah ... it's actually very clever movie and\nAnd uh any on any aren't on whenever they go five six seven equals yet they're getting pretty bad\nThere was a movie out two thousand fourteen I never saw it's kinda weird movie it shows up as one of the horror films have you ever heard of the bottle do [noise]\n[noise] yes I have you know and I did not like the bottom do pretty much did it's Australian film I Believe uh it's about a a mother and her child [noise] and uh they are basically kind of dealing\nWith the grief a of a lost all of a spouse or whatever and a father um and I think it's manifested in this\nIn this creature that kind of comes alive from a children's storybook which kind of looks like London after midnight you know you've got like the top hat and kind of ... kind of hair\nAnd he's a cartoon out of a children's book uh I didn't really I mean it just it didn't I never really believed that Bob at Duke but that wasn't the part of it they didn't like\nI didn't like that it seemed like a two hours do walk commercial where it was just running [laughter] this this allegory for their depression and their grief and that you you don't ever really escape your brief you just have to feed it\nWhat is it about horror and creepy films that people generally\nUm you know I think if you use are you one I think there's two there's two aspects to roller coaster you know there's two kinds of roller coasters you want to ... you get All right you get on a roller coaster and you have so much fun but you want to get back on her to get\nThe other kind of a roller coaster is when you get off your kissing the ground [laughter] in for after want to get on a roller coaster it yeah and\nThey're both fought\nA and I think that you know you you you you you're safe you know you get to put yourself in a kind of a mock a mock danger you know and and but really you're safe and then you feel like you've overcome something and I think that it's just that that Russia I think it's just that thrill\nAnd and again I think it's it for a moment there it makes you forget all the really thing we'll things in real life that really do terrified and I think that\nWell I'm Glad you enjoyed it but I think it's that had

I don't know I Would put the tanker in there and then he did a lot of these uh ... films with Roger Corman or with the the Edgar Allan Poe films um and you know he did a mascot or read a and a ... a lot of uh\nBoth ... films for Roger Corman\nTaylor was on as soon as to England wasn't fifty nine also Mr mobile\nOkay okay so ... so I guess those are some things that may have happened before but the Taylor is a great one um you know it it it is another one where they were the movie house gimmick like house on high hill house on Honda he'll have the skeleton when across a the audience\nThe um the table or have the voters in the seat that was supposed to represent the ... the creature getting loose and\nYou had the screen so it wouldn't to grab onto your spine and get you\nNineteen Ninety he did the part in Edward scissors hand she played the professor\nYes the creative with your hands and of course he died before a guide in real life but in the film he died before he finishes his hands which is why he has scissors for whom\nThe classic Vincent Price story is he was offered a ... percent as opposed to a salary in Michael Jackson's thriller in\nWriting and who's not good I have a salary\nHe he was offered to militias what happened he was offered either or a ... percent of the tank or or just a nominal salary he took the salary he said I Am in\nHim and I don't I can do that one better I he he he got paid with a painting of Michael Jackson [laughter]\nThat was probably worth something [laughter]\nNext up let's go to chip peas in North Carolina forty nine years old chip\nDo you go to movies I'm Sorry you go to movies\nI did yesterday yesterday I just saw the nine to ...\nWe got him and uh on my list I imagine it yet\nOh it's awesome it's part of the uh uh because during ... movies of all the votes yes the great um what I told you about is uh what's your thoughts on the fog and sand tabs on what your two of my favorite a horror movies from the early eighties\nAnd ah I ... I absolutely love than have them a ban has them was a made on the weekends or the ... the kids who made fan passive smoke dope all week and then on the weekends they shot bans has them and um and when they when a cost to rally a you know took him almost a\nReally long schedule I think it took them almost the whole year\nShoot all the footage or the film and um but when they put it all together a it was a great blend aside by and we're and imitate it a lot throughout the eighties I kind of hearken that sort of blend of fantasy side by and horror that you see\nIn a lotta later uh eighties films in the tall man stands as one of the most memorable screen villains a full time\nUh and the fog is truly creepy great film great atmosphere Adrian Barco great ghost story about um the letters\nOr a Nineteen eighty them come back\nFor the gold look through the fog uh it's just a so good you know are still many great performances how whole workers the priest which I think was originally supposed to be um Donald pleasant but I I don't know what he was doing at that time but you know it it just a John Carpenter again we've mentioned several of John carpet assumes Halloween\nBeing one of them are they live being one of them the fog was one of them so I mean John John Carpenter you know next to Steven King I mean John Carpenter dominated the eighties or with a lot of really wonderful imagine if that fails were these inexpensive\nMovies to make\nA comparatively I mean we weren't like Star Wars movies you know I'm I think the great thing about a horror film um\nYou know you can scare some even take sixty thousand dollars and make fourteen million dollars\nFrom you you have the right distribution absolutely\nThough so so that I think that that's why it's such a hearty genre because you can make it on the cheap usually the darker you make it in the morning distinct it is um the more the mind uh takes over you know the less the shark use the the more effective jobs was the last of the alien the\nScarier the alien was so you know there is a lot\nTo uh the slight it's very easy to over produced ... I think it's a horror movie has too much money and it\nIt seems protected you know you look at the second Terminator movie you know if if it doesn't play out like a horror film like the first one 'cause there's just too much money in it and it feels like a franchise\nSo um you know a horror film you know you almost need to cap the budget because if you put too much money and do it it's ... like a surprise and and if you if you can eat the train coming down the track no one is going to knowing shouting blue is going to scare you you know so you it has to kind of be\nA slight of hand it has to appear spontaneous and I think that's why a lot of low budget horror films like neither the living dead grant\nA are incredibly scary and they're cheap\nActors like Bruce Campbell has made a living doing lower budget horror film something\nAbsolutely yeah he's like the Olivier oh really is\n[laughter] and uh you know and and I you know I got to interview him and he was charming guy and uh you know he uh he loves ah you know he pretends he doesn't like it but he he he likes it he likes the attention than\nHe likes to check\nYour likes the paycheck absolutely you know and uh I'm evil dead is a is a great a film for an actor I mean he pretty much is carrying that whole movie on his back he's putting himself through\nA you know all of these ... it's almost like a chaplain where it's just it's you just following through all of these tap blows that they've created for him so it's it you know ... not too many actors can can carry a whole movie on their back\nWhat do you think of the Stephen King movies from his books that all seemed to have that feeling for him a cemetery in things like that\nYeah yeah I mean I I like Stephen king's films a lot more than the books I mean but I mean I'm a film guy you know people always say oh well the book was better it's like they're not exchange commodities you know I mean like Dan is different than a sculpture\nYou know ... book is different than a movie or just you know when you're in the mood for a movie you you you're not in the mood to read a book and vice versa and uh\nYou know what works in a book doesn't work in a movie and I I think that a lot of my favorite Stephen King stuff is all the short stories I think his novels or to a padded too long winded\nYou know what I understand about Stephen King and I you know I've never met the man but you know he doesn't know where the story ends when he starts he just he just keeps writing he he's just as surprised as we are because he just keeps\nA and drinking and writing and ... you know and and then uh you know five hundred pages later it's done so\nIn ... which I think allows for him to the ... you know again ... there there was no formula so I think that I think that that's why his books are so surprising but I think at the same time [noise] you know a good director can kind of boils down\nTo its asked him you know he hated the film the shining and the film is shining I think stands as one of the best pieces of art you know\nYou know I don't know what about TV shows that are dealing with for like the walking dead and things like that\nUh yeah it's interesting because you know I mean well Walking Dead definitely I feel like oh there every night of the living yes and now it's kind of come down to the main stream I'm Down to the front line you

their own programming\nAnd um but there are you know on video and YouTube and and a twitch and every kind of other big on the Internet it's amazing that\nInstant distribution of you know being able to um make a program and are uploaded and I'm now accessible for a million dollars to\nNever be and I have you ever been in touch with our old friend Dr mortgages\n[noise] oh I Would love to talk more if you know I ... I was in his ... might show aired and his market and I got the wonderful stories from than\nAbout his show but I you know I've never accepted an award for him once there was a war host hall of fame or in Indiana and uh they were handing out they work they were acknowledging a bunch of horror host on stage and I want someone to come up with something about mortgage and\nFor whatever reason they didn't have anybody to do that so I ... I I went up and said a few words about ... but you know he he's one of the originals you know from the ice house [laughter] uh and uh ...\nThe er ... yeah but yeah you know that's right Charlie uh you\nKnow he would he would have these incredible experiments on I think he pretty much created or the nutty professor template and I feel that Jerry Lewis probably ripped that off I'm a magical ah\nWell I may not have been jury but it might have been the producers that took advantage of that\nPerhaps it but the wacky world of Dr markets I think is probably the first movie about a whore house that I Know uh and uh you know he was below up in St Louis then in Louisiana and Detroit a\nDetroit you know he had he had a he had a are remarkable run a and a you know of course he's always it's always been a favorite or a a guest of mind or whatever he appeared on coast to coast there\nI ended up working at the TV station in Detroit that he was working out he had left so I didn't meet him there but he was my boyhood idol I Love the guy in how ... how could you not\nAnd then we got to know each other through coast to coast which was an amazing thing and for ah for Christmas one day my network\nFlew him to Los Angeles from New Orleans as a precedent for me and this was so weird Mr mobile because I was on the phone with him a interviewing him\nAnd all of a sudden his voice got more and more distorted ... strange you can hear him but it was just echo we and all of a sudden he walks into the into my studio [laughter] he was he was my Christmas around\nWhat a great trick like like I say our yeah the here\nAnd wanna talented guy he was innovative you know during those days\nWe didn't have a lot of like computer animation and things like that everything he did was innovation and he was just he was funny because his experiments all sealed on television on purpose but everything he did failed and it was just hilarious\nAh yeah and it was ... it ... it would ... it was but he was like watching a magician you know he would create the illusion so perfectly\nAnd then he would shatter it it's really amazing really amazing to see his stuff very funny so who you hear you very clever\nHe came into the studio and were live and he said that he has invented a new force field barrier that stops anything and he told me to take a swing at him and I said no I'm not going to do it and he said he said uh George George this works this works now\nPopped me talk to you right here in the ... are you in the mouth and I did and I knocked us too so [laughter]\n[laughter]

before they added ... the score to Star Wars they just thought it was going to be a dog but I think that John Williams score is just the perfect perfect touch you know it somehow elevate material\nYeah I think so too and Whoopi Goldberg was great and goes by the way\nI won't be Goldberg was uh yeah that was a great role for her and that's the problem I think college would have a lot of difficulty with people who were multi talented and comedians and community female comedians especially\nOf giving them a good roles are or find new to projects for them or you know they don't know how they know how to use these people who were so incredibly talented I think that's a rare occasion where they we found the perfect role for her\nTo go to Brian in Alabama Brian's fifty three Brian

why I was going through capsules I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better I can only tell you one thing the product war\nYou have the body when they're dreaming and that they are having direct contact with the spirit world so they go out and they get information and then they come back and in the morning when they wake up\nIt's like if we were to read the newspaper in the morning and see what happened in the world while we were sleeping they use their dreams to help navigate what they're going to do in the course of the day I and so it's like a pre cognitive experience and the whole culture built around that\nAnd I think that's pretty extraordinary um they also make use of plant medicines or the Iowa ask for example\nOr something that they use for big visions\nSo if they want to anticipate what the whole group should do Twenty years from now they'll use the ... in a collective ritual and that includes little kids you know seniors everybody in the whole sort of community participates\nNews experiences make you more aware of the possibility of God or deserve to use the word\n[noise] I guess it's a matter of definition how do we define God\nThink that the idea that there is something beyond this limited awareness this cap slated mind body that connects us to other mind bodies or suggest something vast\nAnd I also think you know people who are able to access these non ordinary states have consciousness\nExperience depths of reality that aren't part of our mundane everyday experience and that's you know pretty mind altering\nWe are are going to do a lot of different aspects are really the supernatural spiritual reincarnation things are done you've got some great stories about reincarnation\nOf the books that you wrote back in two thousand Fifteen just makes life possible told me about how did you come up with that\nWell I like to say I did but I was working in partnership with Deepak Chopra for a film we made a feature length documentary by that title and he was the one that\nI was giving a lecture at one of his workshops and I was showing a little video that I had done with some of the scientists who are working in this area of you know after death reincarnation\nAnd he pulled me aside after I was done is like\nMarilyn let's make a movie and I thought well wouldn't want to make a movie with Deepak Chopra and then I went to bed that night and I woke up the next morning completely petrified you know the whole idea of having to fundraise and all the rest of it and\nSo at lunch I think Tim very profusely and explains that I really wasn't going to be able to do it and he said oh Marilyn stop worrying about the money the money will come\nAnd I'd like to say it was just that easy but uh we did accomplish something that now has been all over the world translated into multiple languages and\nAired on Oprah about two years ago so it's been out there and making 'em an impact with people who are struggling our goal in both the film and the book was to help transform that fear that people have into an inspiration for really living well\nI mean I was told people I'm not in a hurry to leave but I'm not scared if we have to do it\nRight and we will eventually all of the world that's the whole interesting thing to in terms of future science you know we see now that\nThis cloning is happening they've just clones\nThat can be fertilized to turn into humans in a petri dish\nEach crazy it's amazing it's it's truly spectacular\nYou learn how to download memory and ... should watch and then call new body and then put your memory into the body we live forever\nYeah that may be how we get life on Mars or future beyond that is that it's going to come with you know some kind of genetic manipulation and cloning and\nYou know it may not be that this physical body goes out into space but that it's generations later through these kind of scientific interventions that we start to see the future of humanity\nWhat'd you say to people Marilyn hogwash life after ... knocked continue when we die ... ... what do you say\nWell I'm a respectful that people have various different perspectives different world views and my inclination is to think that what we really believe is probably what we're gonna end up and ah so those people who believe in reincarnation may well reincarnate and those people who believe in\nSort of the Buddhist journey of enlightenment um may end up through in a you know maybe in a black hole somewhere you know alternating at the the threshold of some event horizon I mean I think all of those things\nThat seemed completely far fetched in the past are now something that we can really start to grapple with when\nI made the film I interviewed a Michael ... who is\nIn the ... the well known skeptic he's also you know a really smart guy very interesting and and I use a gun\nYeah I Would say so and I had a really great time interviewing him and what was fascinating there were two things first of all I he acknowledged that one has mom died he heard her voice\nAnd I ... you know with a little surprised that he was telling me this on film and I said well really lets you know go back to that and he said oh well you know it was really nothing but yeah I heard her voice\nAnd I thought well this interesting acknowledgement and he had a good psychological justification that was just some kind of hitting the gods ... experience right at that threshold of of sleep and dreaming\nBut it was interesting that he acknowledged it and then the second thing that I I really loved was that um he got married shortly after my interviewing him\nAnd I guess they got married in either his house or his uh now White House and her father grandfather I Can't remember the details exactly but had left her a radio\nAnd uh it didn't work and Michael had tried and tried to fix it and eventually in frustration he stuck to the radio in a drawer\nAnd didn't think about it anymore and then months later they were having their wedding ceremony and in the middle of the ceremony all of a sudden they start hearing music playing\nAnd they proceeded to complete the ceremony and went in and followed the music\nAnd it was that radio and his wife was quite\nConvinced that this had something to do with her departed loved one Michael wrote a column in Scientific American where he started to play with the idea that maybe this was something more\nAnd his colleagues came down so hard on him that he retracted any kind of open mindedness and went back to his kind of\nEntrenched position of skepticism\nWell what's important to as a skeptic is not a non believer a skeptic wants proof\n[noise] right I mean it comes from the ancient Greek where it went that dogma tests where the people who really understood at NYU and the skeptics were the ones who are questioning it wasn't like they denied the existence of these things that they wanted to raise questions and I think that's different than a bunker\nI think so too and it's a ... I also think it's healthy to be skeptical until you get the proof\nI Do too I think open minded skepticism is the healthiest perspective we can have we're in agreement on that it must be our Detroit impulse\nYou got it Marilyn stay with us we're going to take a quick break we're going to come back and talk more about your work\nIn our final our next hour we'll take phone calls about this but I also want you when we come back to talk about the\nStory of reincarnation about a little child that was born with reports of march and we'll talk about that it's an amazing story so many more Dr

one four or five\nYears on you talked to the voting rights indeed [noise]\n\nWe will take your calls next hour with Dr Merrill Lynch load solves road does makes life possible also consciousness and healing as well and the Marilyn would you tell us the story on the reincarnation of the little child\nWell there's so many stories let's um\nThis one had to step Bruce march or something like\nThat right well in Stevenson was a very unusual psychiatrist who developed a very strong interest and trying to document cases of reincarnation\nAnd he collected about a thousand case studies of young children who had had a some experience of past life that they report it to their family he went in and investigated um did corroborating evidence interviewed people read medical reports\nAnd in about thirty five percent of the people that he identified they had some kind of unusual birth mark a so it's not a typical mould but some kind of unusual birth mark\nAnd it was often associated with the cause of death of the person that the young child remembered\nSo there were numerous examples where for a for instance one child remembered being a man from a different village\nOr in Asia and he um [noise] in Stevens and then went and investigated the biography of this person that the child remembered being\nAnd it turns out that that person was shot through the chest in the same place\nEntry and exit a where the bullet ostensibly went through the body and so that becomes a kind of biological sources evidence for reincarnation and these young people\nYou know it's not absolutely evidence but\nOr evidence shell but it's still compelling\nIn our film we interviewed Jim Tucker who now works in the same Institute at the University of Virginia that in Stephenson had found it and he tells the story of a young boy who uh you know very early just about the time he learned to speak remembered\nBeing his grandfather and he would tell his dad when his dad was changing his diapers a I used to change your diapers and it was kind of shocking for these parents and the sure and then this kid's started remembering\nOther things about the kind of car that he used to drive and [noise]\nLittle test the ah parents got a bunch of pictures from\nThe dad and the first of all they had a class picture when he was in elementary school and so this would be the child grandfather and they asked him to pick out which one was him and he had no problem finding himself in the line up\nAnd then ah they were going through some of the other snapshots and he saw his car and he said that's my car that's my car I used to drive their car and so again it's not\nDefinitive evidence that there is a kind of um survival of consciousness or identity after ... death but these instances give us really compelling\nIdeas about what is possible\nIt does it's truly remarkable you know remember the true story of the little boy who claimed that he was a World War two pilots and the new things about the plane landed too hard the tires would blow up and really nobody knew the other than the crew and the pilot\nAnd he was telling his ... and the and the doctor verified and uh they took him to a reunion a a World War two veterans and he knew shovel of the people from his unit was an amazing story you remember the ...\nI'm I'm vaguely remembering it I don't remember the details of it but I think you're right these things are phenomenally intriguing and it's very exciting I Know that the University of Virginia right now is hiring a post doc to work part time with them and part time at the Monroe Institute\nTo do some psycho physiological research on this\nAh we're right now setting up a lab here at Sophia to look at the cycle man's him and this was a a technique that was used by the ancient or colds and greets\nAnd they um ... ostensibly were able to identify and communicate with spirits\nBy looking at our gazing upon a reflective surface and Raymond Moody develops this protocol where he put people in a darkened room\nPut a mirror on the wall illuminated the mirror and such a way that you couldn't see your own reflection but because you're kind of going into a trance state people start to see things and hear things and experience things\nAnd uh you know there have been a number of experiments looking at people's ability to make contact with their departed loved ones and they have those kind of conversations that they never had a chance to have\nAnd it has been shown to be extremely useful for a brief moment counseling so people have an opportunity they have the conversation they can see it\nThey can see there's the spirits and so what we're doing now is bringing that idea into a virtual reality environment so we'll have people sitting with the virtual reality goggles\nUh looking at a mirror in a sensory deprivation procedure and we're going to record and try to understand what it is that people are experiencing when they enter that state\nOne of our very special guests author and researcher Rosemarie Ellen ... uses black mirror image to do a lot of those\nThat's right and that's really strange uh-huh ... interested in talking to her yeah\nYeah just to do with the charm if you would have marijuana then you'll you'll get you in touch with her or her website is visionary living dot com you might be\nOkay but what you're saying even that title for website is\nReally not so much about what happens after but how those ideas and beliefs and form how we live now and you know we know that people uh believe different things even within a common culture ah I'll have to do is look at the political debate that's happening right now to know that\nPeople ... justify their beliefs based on different kinds of evidence and while in our culture we tend to\nUm hold in esteem the idea of rationed rationality about reason about the idea of objectivity we we make appeals that if we have good objective data that that then is the evidence

the Catholic so I went to go with them seven o'clock ... masks on Sundays and I wouldn't have breakfast too because you you're going to confession and I didn't eat also but there was while they were

some very interesting research some of my colleagues ... and others at the Institute of neurotic sciences we're looking at\nThe possibility that when a medium is getting information that is accurate\nAs compared to when it's inaccurate there may be measurable differences in the brain and in fact that's what they found it was a preliminary study but it showed that when people evaluated\nThe statement made by the medium as having been accurate or correct\nThat the ... the memory center of the brain kind of cleared out it was as though the brains of these mediums we're creating a space for another set of memories to come in\nI find that extremely provocative and interesting so yeah I think there's there's all kinds of mysteries in this world and science will only beginning to approximate some of these experiences that people have\nVery Houdini spent most of these large chasing down mediums wanting to try to communicate with the mother ...\nWell I think there's been a lot of fraud\nThere's been a lot in this direction and that doesn't mean that all instances of communication are wrong or inaccurate so you know again it's how do we know what we know and what is the basis of\nFormulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places\nOf formulating our beliefs are convictions and are they right or not you know it's often we get stuck in places that aren't necessarily the best path forward\nBack to the phones now we go Georgian Corpus Christi Texas was George Europe\nHello George junior high or just the

just wanted to hear her say walk in a thank you so much I Love the show\nNike joy and scientists are beginning to think the heart is much more than a pool\nAnd the guts I mean we know that we have multiple sources of intelligence in our bodies and I think that's extremely interesting I don't know and the answer to the question\nAre we evolving toward a higher consciousness or\nAre we evolving toward greater levels of complexity in technology but are more allergy and our ethics haven't really changed that much I've been watching\nA show on the met a cheese\nAnd we know that you know they were catalytic to the time of the renaissance and promoting our ten language and science but at the same time there was enormous corruption and you know people poisoning other people to get them out of the way or\nYou know really creating false narratives about people talk about false news\nUm fake news you know it's been happening and I think people have manage their inability to resolve different points of view through violence and I'm not seeing right now that there's a whole lot of\nAlternative higher level um meaning centered altruistic kinds of principles that are certainly being communicated in the popular media by our political leaders I'm just not seeing a lot of\nUh references to a hopeful message for our own evolution toward something higher if we want to use that metaphor and it doesn't mean I'm not helpful because I also see that there is tremendous good in the world and often times we just need to shine the light on\nThat I think eventually good beach over you don't you\nI sure hope so I mean I think if we have an option of what to believe that's a good one to believe in\nYou sound a little tentative mobile I Am a little um huge\nYeah I'm a little skeptical of how much we can simply just say yes everything's going to be fine you know I'm just not sure that that's really where the story goes I think each of us in our life can make choices and do we want to\nAh grab hold of our highest potential do\nWe want to develop our social and emotional intelligence you\nKnow those things take effort and if not people can just resort back to these kind of base impulses that come from the amygdala and the fight or flight and we don't really get that prefrontal cortex involved\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFight for our freedom ... some giving

something that\nYou are on a path for a long time to complete but things have changed some somehow the path it's changed it's almost like for instance being engaged to someone for five years and then finding out that this isn't the one and then finding that you have to switch paths if something like that to where you\nWould have been invested in it and now you're going this might not be where I Want to go with this part of my life and so you're bringing yourself back to your beach it's almost as if you are finding clarity for the first time you're you're figuring things out exactly how you want it to go\nAnd you're heading back to your pitch meaning you're gonna be on solid ground uh your barefoot so nobody extra no nothing is holding you back and it's basically it feels good it tastes like I don't even know any way to put it it it would be a situation that\nAnd it's\nBasically it feels good it tastes like I don't even know any way to put it it it would be a situation that might feel sticky like you're in a sticky situation or or you might feel like I'm about to do something that is going to upset some people\nBut I don't think it's a bad thing because you're actually being true to yourself and making decisions that you're making right now\nSo if you're if you're finding herself caught up going how am I going to do that\nSomebody's going to be angry [noise] just under ... are you being true to your heart or are you following through with something if you were to choose the other way would you make yourself sick that kind of a thing you don't want to be sick so truly\nGet back on your beach I think it's time to read grounds and finally just kind of\nBe at peace with who you are right now I'm because it looks like you've had a lot of growing to do it and if you've had a lot of mentors and a lot of help and a lot of positive stuff around you right now it's all about you so enjoy your time or it thank you\nJay Jay's everyone was ... yeah thanks so much for the call from Arkansas\nNext up we have Audrey in Kansas Audrey welcome to beyond reality radio you're wrong with Rebecca foster\nThanks for taking my call I'm excited I'm Rebecca\nHi Adrienne how are you okay let's see what's going on for\nYears to you know that they will have a minute and a half\nYear before Trump into breaks you may have to do this one quickly or hold it over depending on what you want to do\nOkay very quickly I Would just say that this looks like a father figure that's coming through and wants me to I own thing as I could tell a path to wave 'em so not really saying much but\nWaiting and it's funny 'cause it smells like like maple syrup and bacon he's like smelling like breakfast to this person to me it's not like breakfast like I Want to go have breakfast with him and sit down and just\nTalk and discuss and I get like some of my best advice during this time from this individual so is this is a father figure coming through that want to say hello [noise] I'm an an initial I'm thinking comes through like a marker Marty something like that are and they are name that's coming through that wants to\nMeet you acknowledge that you [noise] so I think you probably should message me so that we can finish that conversation [laughter]\nOr how would how would Audrey do dead I'm Rebecca how does everybody message you um if they will fall under discussion here tonight\nYes everybody you know what you can easily go to my website um it's Rebecca foster dot cold and um it's the oh it's not dot com or you can go to the mid west medium dot coal and I'm\nGoing to just the contact me page and um I get all of the emails everything else I Know you have to move on but I Will get back to everybody eventually don't delete anything though are way to contact\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUm so I Do this this dark rich kind of terms colors almost as if it's like changing rainbow we behind you and it lights up all these iridescent color as you walk across the bridge so at this represents to me\nTo tell you is that your past you're walking on right now is going to help a lot of other is to be able to cross the bridge similar to that\nSo you're leading the way for people and you are making changes another's lives I think some of which you would probably know about but others I don't think you would know unless they really came up and said you did this and you you made it possible for me to see that I can walk across the bridge\nSo there's something very inspiring about whatever you're doing right now on this earthly level I don't think it's just earthly but I Do think that it is fed from above and that you would be inspired to complete tasks that you otherwise might look at and go I Can't do that\nBut I can do that it's that kind of a thing like there are things that Rebecca into that Becky can't do [laughter] if it's that kind of a thing and if that makes sense kind of\nInsurance they wanted to change that we also talked about ... and sometimes it doesn't make sense at the moment but then the ... moment down the road you know so well\nYeah you know that in mind rose um much go to Samantha calling from California Hisham answer your rumbles Rebecca\nHi how are you thank you for taking my call Rebecca\nHi okay Samantha you said your name was okay I keep forgetting everybody's name so I Apologize to everybody if I don't prefer to you but\nI'm so Samantha the first thing that they show you is that you are opening up a book and and it's funny because you look like you've been carrying this book for a long time\nAnd you kind of refer back to it and you're like ... you know and and finally you take this book and you let it fall open and use it and all of a sudden you're like totally engrossed and you're sitting in your reading this book and you're like oh my gosh and\nIt not only does this represent just regular education in learning as as time goes by but it very well looks like it could represent you where education is concerned and finally going on how\nI got it I figured out what I wanted to do with my life where I Want my life to go where I Want my education to lead\nAnd and I think that your spirit is kind of one that hops and skips where it's needed so you're a bit of a Jack of all trades where you're good at a lot of things uh it's just that\nBeing able to nail something down may have been taking some time and now it looks like whatever resource you had with you this whole time is what's going to guide the rest of your life so I Would think of anything that has like a natural talent\nSomething you've been bored with something that you have wanted to do for a long time and maybe thought oh I Can't survive on that I Can't do that for a living I think you're going to\nSo I Would focus on whatever little seeds are being planted around you and watch them and let them flourish and harvest so seat [laughter] so okay we're not going to get a little tennis do you\nThink you write Sandra ... nation which for the call came after we appreciate what does your one more call right now and we're going to go to ... by the way the phone number's eight four four six eight seven seven ... and Jimmy Johnson Bruce mark issue with me we we were doing readings with Rebecca [noise]\nAnd we appreciate reading along with us from school to a ... in Arkansas Tasha welcome to the program Ron with Rebecca\nHi Rebecca Hi Sasha how our isn't Natasha Natasha Natasha Natasha okay\nI I just hate I I always try to figure out everybody's name [noise] um so the first thing for you that they're showing is that you are\nNatasha okay I just hate I I always try to figure out everybody's name [noise] um so the first thing for you that they're showing is that you are walking down a hallway now always will usually generally represent like an earthly path\nOkay so if I'm following you down your pathway right now it looks almost as if the lights have been turned off on me and I'm having to go by\nThis little light that's behind you so\nThis is like a a green ball of light one one thing that you know is green represents physical healing green represents you being good in okay now that falls me then as you're walking down the toilet dark oh my gosh really got so much\nSo that the the the next thing they do is they show me blood they showed me like blood flowing through you assess represents something that you may be dealing with where your blood is concerned like we're red blood cells are concerned so either or lack\nThere of or an issue or like anemia of some kind so there is a physical healing coming your way about this and it feels like it could be almost painful okay that you'd be dealing with this\nAnd it's it's it's following behind you which means that you guys are saying there is a path and walk right a walkway here on this path that you are going to have to trust yourself and walk forward there not leading you they're not standing on either side of you there behind you saying you've got that\nYou've got this you can do this so they're leading you from behind right now they're making you trust yourself and build your self confidence\nFurther down the hallway as this health and the relationships and all this other stuff but right now one of the biggest things for you is that you are going to heal\nAnd this green light represents that that it's following behind you like this glowing ball of light on and and and they do mentioned relationships and I know we have to go but you are going to um\nYou were going to wake up to something that I think you already intuitively know about a personal relationship\nThat you're going to go I knew I knew you know what I knew that I felt that I understood that and now I'm getting the confirmation that says you are right and so now remember that\nBecause we're that information is coming from you know in the future when it comes through that same place even trust it you help us people and then you got all you got people coming around like you've got some form of a party so this tells me someone around you must have just recently passed\nAs a female and that you've got these people like all around you having a party on the heavenly side and they're like partake in in what the family is doing here so this feels like a female elderly the my grandmother or at\nLike a a mother's sister or grandmother sister so like a great aunt I don't know\nHow to work like great aunt or an aunt and then\nIt's just a big party and there's a lot of people and blacks I'm supposed to tell you that they're not supposed to be wearing a bunch of blacks you prefer like jewels colors like emerald sapphire and ruby [laughter] it's hoped that makes sense [laughter] thank you so much that you're wrong\nAnd they charge you so much for the St Joe okay so we're going to take a break here um and when we come back we're going to continue with your phone calls to telephone number is eight for for six or seven seven to ... district those pretty quickly a ...\nBy the phone calls just keep coming in non stop the lines are always full pretty amazing stuff this is a remarkable it's incredible how Rebecca ... able to glean so much just from someone's name and just hearing the voice for a moment or two\nRebecca is a good question actually and we you know I've had the conversation before but there are a lot of new names are new faces New Year's associated with program tonight how'd you how'd you get the energy what did you come from when you're doing a reading\nAnd the conversation before but there are a lot of new names of new faces New Year's associated with program tonight how do you how do you get the energy where did you come from when you're doing a reading for somebody\nWell on that the information that I get a it comes from a spirit constantly not conscious and the guy comes from who we believe in and on who we prayed to economists from what we what we give ourselves up to you know privately\nAnd so regardless of religion or creed or what we believe in it all the same energy you don't even have to speak English I I you know hopefully it's better if you understand English cause I probably can't speak a lot of other any other language other than in\nAll right so we're going to go to yeah we're going to go to break right now and then we're going to take more of your phone call sorry to cut you off Rebecca but we have to get to break it's beyond reality radio on JV Johnson [noise]\n\nDid you ever look at the stains and aid for your teeth\nPower swamps is the
