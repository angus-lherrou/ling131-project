look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism many [laughter] she's it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the Monroe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I mean each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um\nWhen a controlled holistic environmental chamber in other words\nEach person's in and personal isolation booth and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present Emmys sank which has a brain synchronization to kind of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do ... five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state and every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphone\nNow he's like a cubicle or a ... and a decline or well how no it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can if you can close it off completely you can block out um\nIt's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that because you can go deeper with no or external stimulus actions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um the\nFlow chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit and all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nDo you have headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talked to them and their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nI mean they don't feel alone because you have headphones on and you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\n... and and people go on these incredible journey is a friend who had all the time I'm ... now anything technology in the minority someone into in ada hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy Nora will be technology it's been around for a long time that it helps us to go deeper faster that's a concept\nOr will be technology it's been around for a long time that it helps as you go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on ... where would you and I know that ... pattern that you teach people to it it's kind of a formula right\nWell there's a yes there's relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression that are used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided often guided where you would just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experience during even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate\nTheir own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed fly for Russians mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to our inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say ... opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself were the answers are where you can begin to explore\nYour true self\nAnd to open up to that awake into that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what kept him questions could you ask yourself and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets a journal or they bring a journal\nYou immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery because information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they awakened to\nTheir their true self and they're the answers within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are\nHappening in the can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house and then I mean away your experience you William how they died in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend my friend has been a guest on the show before she said that she has in the past encountered\nSouls that need help and I think that's fascinating councils that\nSure um we actually have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just means ... assistance\nSo we have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just me need assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well or where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say\nTo people that and there are people that have died but they are lost or for instance someone that may have died um quickly and\nThey're just disoriented and they may need some assistance I Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and um\nAt at ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um\nTo let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing or have you ever done this after\nA [noise]

concerned about your heart health or knows no more than you should consider cardio mobile the MBA clear personal EKG device for Ninety nine dollars cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone and it\nI yeah I I'm but I my question more it's more about the how do the Native Americans feel and the people feel about these places that are being built on the men are she springs area and garden of the guards in the area of pikes peak\nWell that is really very interesting and the other good question because the the the legend is that our town is constantly flooded baptized by water every seven years and so it seems to be true\nNow I looked into this and I'm like going All right well when's the last time that we've actually had somebody tried to remove the curse\nAnd it was back in two thousand\nAnd what happened was in Nineteen Ninety nine we had a huge flood again and it wiped out our spa building and it was almost going to be demolished\nThe Murphy company came in and they spent uh quite a lot of money to have this building completely Reagan got it because it had to get rid of all this is about this and that was like three million dollars right there\nBut anyway just to make sure that their investment was not going to be flooded\nThey actually asked five members of the Native American Indian canceled come here and do a healing right over the town and over the spot building and I actually read the article\nIn the Colorado Springs does that and it said after they did the healing ritual in front of the spa building that five pros who up into the air\nAnd not even being able to find true not north flew into the building and crashed I'm not kidding you you've got if you want to look it up it's easy to do\nLooking [laughter] and then at home and I don't\nKnow but you know what in two thousand Thirteen it flooded again it didn't work\nRight to it feels like an elementary maybe they shouldn't do it again yeah we do not want a concept I mean there\nYeah it feels like an arm and to me maybe they shouldn't build their again yeah we do not somebody with a concept I mean\nThere are certain things to be said for the history tours and things that are being done in these secret lands ... or ... being built and so forth where's the this fine line there to honor and respect the lure of that particular layman\nYeah I I say thanks every day you know to the good lord to the spirits that lead to the land that be and I give there's a legend about manatees springs that you're not allowed to leave annoys you ask for permission or less you're ready to leave you come here because you are supposed to learn a lesson you don't come here because it's a choice\nYou Martin summoned to this town and I know that sounds crazy but I have talked to so many people over the years and I always ask them I say so what brought you to manage to springs I'm always the same story it was the weirdest thing you know I never planned on moving here and my car ran out of yes uh-huh and\nStuff like that and when you hear so many of them you know this isn't a coincidence\n... interesting so let's go back to the idea of what to do if you are sensitive to these types of energy or maybe you have a ghost in your house or something that might be\nVisiting you what what do you suggest to people that maybe don't want you want to be with the transition when I Move on already yeah\nSee I think that when someone dies now I I Want to ... this would make sure that I don't offend anybody is religious or spiritual beliefs this is these are just my feelings I think when someone dies for the first three days\nOr so that maybe that spirit linger is that they stay here some people believe that some you know maybe you just hang around to see her funeral and then you leave if you're not have both\n[laughter] um other stay right up but if\nThere is a lingering energy in your home get rid of it or move\n[laughter] usually own that particular place not see eye earlier in the conversation I did say that my house has haunted that I live in now and that\nI Want to say but the ... that it is it used to be the pikes peak Bible college that has a very interesting history and anyhow the other day band that it is that the veil of so than this time of year I actually heard choir and music in my house I've lived here for Fifteen Years have never heard that before\nI ran into the dining room and then it it ceased I Know it was inside of my house I heard it my dog's heard it they were howling\nLike is going on I think that's a residual it's like a group in time you know quantum says this and explain it better than I can but I just think of it is like Brent toast you can still smell the burnt so [laughter] it's gone yeah I live\nIn time make more sense where it could be a coming back into this dimension temporarily in a split second\nYes and see that doesn't have a consciousness the choir music that I heard did not have a consciousness we\nMean by that means it was just like I heard it in the room like some it was a burping time does that make sense to have a conscious\nIt's yeah it's just music that I heard like they came through sometimes believe it or not I can hear the trains that used to run behind my house that ran in over a hundred years yeah so yeah when I hear so I don't know other people\nDo [laughter] you have anybody around that you could ask me\nAre in tune with the higher laws of nature as I say delicately they can they can pick up on it to have children especially that's why I Love it when when\nMuch more in tune with the higher laws of nature as I said delicately they can they can pick up on it to have children especially that's why I Love it when when little children come on my tour is because um I turned it down a little bit so I don't scare them so much but ah the kids have a great time because they haven't been taught not to see\nRight right so back to where people feel that they're afraid of ghost you're saying that they're not usually wanting to stay they want to move on or they should move on and\nMove on I think it would be like you know when you're hungry you just know to eat\nHow do you help but uh being do that how would you suggest or how would you teach someone to us this this goes to move on\nWell you can always try talking to it [laughter] I Swear it works but would you ask\nI tell it are you you need to move on you know you're not supposed to be here anymore and I know this is your house and you love it that you are not supposed to be here anymore your loved ones that are waiting for you on the other side you need to go\nAnd just talk to them like a kind of person would talk to anyone who was scared and confused the beans are just like they were on earth and some of them get hot here it's it's really sad if you think about these go centers that go out and our teasing them like they're\nLike they're like in the zoo or something\nYou know he's not very nice\nMcCain Ghostbusters where they could vacuum them up and put them into two yeah when you asked this where you say to this this entity that might be hanging around and causing Mr move on ... ... why do people get scared\nI think that you know what those hunting is addicting first of all it is so fascinating we both in fascinating with what's on the other side and then once you have validation I tell you what it does not stop it that it's like gambling or something it\nOpens up a whole new world of possibility and happily\nThis happened and then you do feel special because so many people want a validation that there is life after death let's be honest and when you do have it happen\nIt blows your mind and you will never forget it and you will never let anyone talk you out of what you saw the that's what happened to me when I was a child my parents told me that it was because they brought me on the head when I was a baby\nImagine that yeah so I mean they all my life I just hope that I was crazy and I'm not [laughter]\nOther people have had it happen enthusiastic I Would say [laughter] but now Trump which do you started this wonderful conventions paranormal convention travels to various areas tell us a little bit about\n[noise] well um we call it a mood movable fees like I said and so when we go into different areas the very very very first thing that we do is we contact with the local historians\nAnd the local goes hunting groups and we say we want to be your advocate we are here to help you and your community you need to get rid of any of those were here we're not going to be like those guys so we're really like I Would call us paranormal psychologists [laughter]\n... yes\nAnd that's what we do and we're very kind and we're and we try to talk them over or do whatever we can write a book [laughter]\nSo when you do the ... you have a group to come with you and it's more of an active type of tour right\nMy two words it's because of the town

returning a battle in Iraq and Afghanistan\nNow you you teach them and really tell us what does look like when you have people come and I called in after all tourism many [laughter] it really is an adventure and you say beyond the body\nYes it is it's um the among roe Institute which by the way I'm calling from\nHow great in Virginia I'm only\nTwenty four people can attend it's a world renowned as being the center for the exploration of consciousness but in my workshop\nI'm generally what I each person is in a check unit or Bob Monroe had a real thing for ah\nThese Akron as ... and um when that controlled holistic environmental chamber in other words each person's in and personal isolation both and I speak to them when we're doing a technique through headphones so everybody's in their own isolation chamber\nAnd then I present Emmy sank which is a ... a ... brain synchronization to kind of technology plus guided meditation\nAnd we do five of these uh day typically and what what the idea here is to guide each person to go into a nice deep meditative state and every person listening in their own isolation chamber through the headphones\nNow he's like a cubicle or ... and ... and a decline or how no it's\nA it's a it's a cubicle each person has their own individual cubicle that's the size of like a single bad okay and you can it's you can close it off completely you can block out um it's the whole idea is to create an isolation chamber why is that\nBecause you can go deeper with no or external stimulus factions like I'm In many ways the same concept behind um the flow chambers exempt in this case you're not floating you're you're in this this controlled unit\nAnd all the sound is piped into the room we use special technologies like him he sank\nYou hands headphones on\nYes everybody wears headphones and I talk to them and their control unit and I guide them through these series of exercises\nAnd they don't feel a loner isolated right\nNo that's the idea you are isolated\nI mean they don't feel alone because you have headphones on and you know\nThey they're listening through headphones and exercise minor typically about a Fifteen minutes long each one\nAnd and people go on these incredible journey friend who's been several times um wet when he and he thinks he is the ... and ... data hate\nYes the idea is to get them as deep as possible um and the fate is of course are ideal for many people but the idea is of course to put yourself\nBy Nora beat technology it's been around for a long time and it helps us go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then\nOh gee it's been around for a long time and it helps us go deeper faster that's a concept\nOkay All right and then where do you go on Germany where would you and I know that there's an pattern that you take people see it it kind of a formula right\nWell there is a yes or relaxation I use sometimes what would be considered to be light hypnosis\nUm there's different progression setter used but it's basically a meditative type of program that's guided often guided where you will just go along with the program\nAnd um and have your own experience everybody has different experience\nDuring even my program I'm teaching people how to self initiate their own out of body experience but in my class for instance people have passed fly for Russians mhm they have contact\nWith all kinds of let's just say a non physical being different kinds everybody has their own type of experience when we open up to our inner self people experience different kinds of\nAh let's just say I opening a mind opening expansive experiences mhm so it's not limited to just out of body experiences\nA for instance past life or ... or regression type flashes are quite common\nAnd there's the whole idea is to open up to this inner party yourself where the answers are where you can begin to explore\nYour true self went\nIn to open up to that awaken too that multi dimensional self within you\nSee what tipped him questions could you ask yourself and then you write them down when you come out of this like write it down right away\nYes what I always suggest is that right after the exercise you everybody receipt gets the journal or they bring a journal\nAnd you immediately after the exercise you begin to journal whatever ... whatever kind of information may have come to you or imagery because information can be\nTransmitted many different ways it's not necessarily all the boy can be through imagery or through a just a um memory download or all kinds of ways so it's it's important to be open to the way that you receive information\nBut uh people have all kinds of profound experiences and they awakened to\nTheir their true self and they're the answer is within them\nMhm yeah so the implication that personal growth in the spiritual awakening that are happening in these can really be transformational and I like it because you find your house and then and then in a way your\nExperience you William how they died in in the direction that I Would have my own personal experience now\nMy friend mine I freeze has been a guest on the show before she said

those people that just mean need assistance\nYou have an entire class devoted to that where people meet and guide those people that just mean need assistance\nOr that's but that will happen in um in all the classes that can happen that comes up in my class as well\nOr where people have contact and um provide guidance let's say to people that in ... there are people that have died but they are lost or for instance someone that may have died um quickly and they're just disoriented and they may need some assistance\nI Know that that type of thing does happen quite a bit and job\nAt ... at the Monroe Institute we offer sixteen different classes and one of those classes focuses on that type of guidance it's called guidelines I'm which I'm you're trained to literally assist others in that um [noise] and\nTo let's just say a system to go to a higher dimensional space\nMhm mhm so to assist him in crossing or have you ever done this after\nA\nTragic incident and national tragic in Massachusetts so renal one\nI have because I I ... I was practicing out of body experiences uh during nine eleven era\nAnd myself and I received a lot of contact ah during that period of time um that was a that was one of those events where there was a lot of people that were just totally disoriented let's put it that way a marriage and you're having coffee one morning and your office\nAnd suddenly your entire body is gone ... I mean can you imagine I mean it's hard for us to even wrap our minds around that so there was a lot of people that we're assisting those um\nPeople that died and this is a this is an ongoing process it's done by many around the world and it it's it's functions and different names and different cultures\nBut and then I went to two we we presented in I think\nI'm more or let's just say I'm very grounded in a scientific waves at least the scientific as we can\n... that goes for all the training here it's a it's done in a way that's presented in a very logical way that's a understandable with no cultural or religious overtones in other words\nWhich yeah which is great because you really allowed to have their own experience it in on that I went to find out a little bit more on how one of the culture and does this and what it's called genetic content and we're going to take a quick break William thank you so much and when we come back we'll talk about\nC.

I mean these\nThis is just real events that are happening the fascinating\nPeople all over the world I mean we're a multi dimensional beans that's what we are and are biological body\nYou know we have to realize we're not we're not biological beings we're only here for a very brief period of time and then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without\nAnd then we exit and we move on to another state of consciousness and another energy body and that's what we've discovered without a body exploration\nIs that it's multi dimensional and that death is in a ... really I'm no no that's been said but\nOnce you encounter and experience and communicate with loved ones who are passed and you're doing this face to face this is life changing you no longer need a psychic to act as the intermediary you you you're empowered to\nDiscover the answers for yourself\nAnd really to find out what kind of journey are we all on 'cause this is an amazing journey of consciousness we all share\nYeah it is but you know what I shared this with you but I just interviewed Raymond Moody on my guy in show and you know the ... the grandfather and coined the term a life after death and\nUm he had\nExpressed to me after fifty years of doing that\nIs that\nHe doesn't know for sure\nThat that yeah life after death exist because scientifically it's never really been proven even though he's heard thousands and thousands of reports of people who have experience\nIs a life after life ... ... he still doesn't as a scientist as a ... right is not you know for sure this\nIs exactly why self initiated out of body exploration is so important because you get that verification absolute personal verification that you need books study research will never give you that kind of verification you\nCan read a thousand books you could spend your entire lifetime studying this topic\nAnd it's not going to give you the inside and the verification you'll get from one out of body experience because suddenly you know you go from being a researcher or a believer to an hour\nAnd that's the big huge step that all of humanity I think is moving towards\nI mean we need to we need to wake up to what we truly are\nAnd to get away from this bickering and confusion in division I mean once you realize that you're you're not just a biological being you know you're continuing ... and beyond this temporary stage of development\nIt puts everything into a whole different perspective\nAnd I'm not the first time I mean this is not the Buddhist up and saying this for a long time that you know we're more than our bodies and that were involved in beyond the body and we are all life is evolving beyond the body this is a temporary stage of our revolution\nYeah and I meant to say that rain and then he coined the term near death experience sorry I didn't mean like a afterlife that that's in let's say you know when I did my own Google Search on\nI just typed in near death experience in over twenty five million search has come up on Google were not the only ones that are interested in is this is becoming more and more of a\nA phenomenon a popular topic people are interested in what beyond disorder now I have been yeah not sort of played so much as the er anymore but\nI Want to ask you you could you had an experience like if you were sick and you\nHere anymore and when you had any and like you were there and you had the same thing you you were saying can you use ... out of Bonnie ... human and we can you tell us about that\nWell in two thousand eleven I I've discovered I had a serious a stage for cancer of the lymph nodes and tonsils and I it was a shock it was\nAmong very quickly out a large tumor on my neck ...\nAh yeah the lymph nodes into anyway there was a serious issue and I had to get immediate had\nTo make quick decisions on this because it was a you know it spreads I'd ... broken and kept solution so I I went through traditional um because it was so quick and so fast I did a traditional medicine\nBut um during my recovery\nI was having some really profound out of body experiences and in a sequence of events\nIt just takes time description opioids it only takes a little to lose a lot is at CDC Dr slash are excellent\nThis is governor Brian Sandoval since two thousand ten in Nevada more than twenty eight hundred people have died and there have been more than thirty thousand visits the emergency room because of opioid overdoses opioid abuse requires a person's brain leading to addiction so if there's a chance of addiction for you or someone you love\nSeek help immediately put a healthier envy dot org for information and\nResources this message sponsored by the Nevada department of health and Human Services aired in cooperation with the Nevada broadcasters association and the storm\nThat dumped into hard ... studios K intend ti a up north Las Vegas ...

you what you are and where you're going nobody can you after you experience it and then you said oh my God now I got it\nAnd it's it's a transformational powerful experience and it's very self empowering\nMm need in you know back to the report that you had you talked about the common maybe put it in ... and also\nThe average age of the first Adam ... ... ... people Rick recount painting and it's often heated experience it happened over and over again but he declines during early teenage years why do you think that is really central forget that\nI I think the children are just more open to naturally experience their multi dimensional self and once you hit ... based on all my research once you hit puberty everything just starts to\nShut down I think it as an interest just affects us something to do with it everyone including ... yeah refocusing\nTheir attention on their um let's just say their biological urges certain mhm but children are I I have an entire chapter devoted to this is my second book\nAbout children's out of body experience I have received thousands of letters from over the decades from parents who have share their experiences\nOf letters from over the decades from parents who have shared their experiences\nWith about their children unfortunately I'm In our society sometimes either misinterpreted and you know they they end up taking their child to a psychologist or psychiatrist because it's out of there\nOut of the norm around family to deal with huh so they end up giving the child Ritalin or something else to calm them down or whatever or it's unfortunate because there it's just natural you know ... or ... you know what's funny is that Ninety over Ninety percent of Americans\nBelieve that there is an afterlife\nThat we are non physical spiritual being and in other words and if we are as most people believe them why would we be locked into a biological machine for our entire life Web when that's not what we are\nWe we have a natural ability to explore beyond their physical limits the Buddhist of known this forever that's why they train young Buddhist boys at a very young age to begin their training and meditation\nBecause they're more open to having profound spiritual or multi dimensional experiences when they're young\nRight and we don't we don't receive that ... we've been trained to be a very materialistic from birth so that has a tendency we have to overcome that conditioning that most of us have or the\nRight to not mostly focused on the journal when we're young somewhere between two to five years older than the voting on and on the average number amount of money in a report in\nYes they're very young and they continue up to puberty and a lot of them were amazed I have twin boys in my boys both of them would have just profound experiences\nNow it was it was amazing to me what they would do it at night\nAnd it's incredible I had one and now you say it's common even encounter other in your experiences can you go back and read the team had a nightmare and you want to go back and you when you\nClose the and create a new ending to it and her dream technique\nOh absolutely can you do that you can a nightmare\nIs a ... is a reflection of your fear\nAnd during and it's a matter of fact it's a technique I teach um that we have the ability to confront and let's just say dissolve our fears during an out of body experience in a very elegant manner you send loved to the fear during the out of body experience\nUm in other words you don't run from it you can from it and you send loved to it and dissolve that fear and you do it fully conscious not just in a dream\nBut imagine it works in a dream to but imagine how much more powerful that would be if you're fully absolutely conscious\nAnd you do the same technique where you are literally dissipate in dissolving\nFears are blocks that's the great block for self knowledge is fear right it's like it's a great block that all of us confront and one way or another it's\nIt's an invisible box that everybody create surround themselves and that's important I find that out of body exploration gives us that ability to confront\nOh and that's important I find that out of body exploration gives us that ability to\nConfront and dissipate and dissolve those fears that end up uh that just said eliminating our our ability to express ourselves fully in this life\nIt although he eighty six percent to respond and supported new here no fear hearing out of money and they had a very peaceful thanks\nYes according to this survey Haiti like that's any harm it\nYes it was it was pretty high remember that a lot of people responding to me also were not um they were open to the experience to some degree I have to\nAcknowledge that that's a good point ah they were not\nLet's say indoctrinated with this health far and damnation ... I'm a belief system\nThat of course is nothing but fear\nHere is a controlling mechanism it's been used for centuries to control the population out and it's still used today actively unfortunately the control um ... you know societies\nOr we'll notice there's always an enemy and there's always some kind of thing that needs to be a feared\nAnd ... that is one of the great things that I think we have an opportunity to realize when we have an out of body experience you realize number one you were a mortal\nAnd it sounds a little grandiose for them you know that you know my God I'm more than my body I Am an immortal I'm I'm not some um week pathetic\nBeing that needs to be manipulated or told what to think uh you know I'm I'm a powerful non physical spiritual be\nAnd that's amazing shift in consciousness for the individual\nI Am more than my body really does help you and your level of consciousness and forget\nAbout tiny problem in life that you feel are still large because our brain me in that way they truly they are insignificant when you come here and he knew\nHow down our universe really is I'm Talking about being beyond Bonnie yeah yeah\nAnd what's so important is for us to have our own transformation or experiences I I think that's critical to our evolution individual and collectively otherwise when you have your own profound experience\nYou you you can no longer be manipulated by these external forces around you because you know better you just look at it like it it's just the drama it's the game that's being played all around us and you look at it like that\nAnd you know it and that's makes a difference you don't get sucked in for instance the political drama the day you don't get sucked into that stuff could you realize it's a temporary drama\nAnd and you understand there's a bigger game it's foot here you the big game is to know your true self to have your own profound experience\nSo that you know the answers for yourself and you're no longer a pawn of anyone else any belief system government religion you are free of all of that indoctrination and that's and that is incredibly powerful\nYeah and I think more on the scene\nYou are free of all of that indoctrination and that's that is incredibly powerful\nYes and I think more of us need to understand that and get out of the rock that we tend to get in with his his era ... news that we\nHadn't ridiculous and that's and you realize it's you know there's so much of a court and stuff that we need to know about ourselves the greatest problem with humanity is a lack of knowledge of\nSelf ... that's the core\nIssue involved in all the ills that face humanity is lack of knowledge himself if every one seven billion of it suddenly or work one day and knew what we were\nAnd where we come from and where we're going there'd be no conflict there'd be no wars there'll be no no ... none of that\nWould occur ... because we would know better\nIf we really truly knew we were all connected but there are just some beans on this planet we don't want to be connected with that theory doesn't work can we really truly I'll be connected to only the ones that want to be connected to [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWell come back to coast to coast am Ryan Lee cigar and my guess William ... is joining me his website again is astral info dot org now uh we have great colors come in William you may cause sure and has to let's go to\nJamie in Washington state first time caller here and coast to coast and Jeannie when did you know question\nOh how's it going great\nWhat is your question my friend\nUm if I was curious if there's any or relevance between the out of body experiences and a memory loss\nGood question question you mean not remembering the experience or memory loss in general\n... of coalition a little bit of both uh either long term memory and of the uh out of body experience itself but not\nWith your like everyday memory of needing to recall a certain things that you use all the time so to speak like worth and stuff like that and drive and things like that\nOh I Would say definitely not a I can speak for myself I think my memory is excellent and I've been having out of body experiences for over forty years\nOr so I I well like I don't I don't see any ah um correlation\nLike a TV I Would be associated with memory loss and ... and Tom issues when you have a brain trauma but not so much the out of body techniques it doesn't just served their brain memory patterns that All right\nNo I have not seen any correlation for that I um I absolutely not matter of fact a lot of people that have out of body experiences or have an incredibly productive and lives in their late years like Robert Monroe did and others that are written many books\nI'm In their later years let's say [noise]\nSo if anything I think there's the opposite I think ah you open up potentially um certain pathways that enhance your ability to remember and to function\nSometimes the have you ever experienced is Jamie an added ...\n... you know the symptoms and I I can relate to the same thing that I'm just trying to figure myself out so to speak you know yeah Mm make myself poll what now with my phone she's so\nNow that's great thank you so much for your phone call I appreciate it yeah that's one of the techniques that William talks about is discovering yourself through out of body travel and I do like the fact that it doesn't end isn't to say she is with the TV I any type of trauma or\nBrain injury we want to avoid those they they're not\nThat isn't isn't she does with the TV I any type of drama or\nBrain injury we want to avoid those they they're not saying no no it's\nA unfortunately a lot of people do associate the two ... and it's and it's not the case at all now granted there are people do a for instance a lot of people correlate near death with obese because obese or an element of near death\nBut the two were actually even though ... ... ... are part of the near death experience there also independent of them so it's important distinction to make\n... interesting and I gave in New Jersey I well I like for ... million in aid\nHey Lisa the call is Kelly from inside the studio\nAnd thing [laughter] right [laughter] you know\nThis is where it might get a little weird but I was he a lawyer I was growing up a place called ... town Pennsylvania we moved there when I was about two and I started getting visitation\nThat would this visit patients they gave me um I first saw of ... a day a Catholic school\nOr failed out of the scale load by has both my days where there's all those two girls and their lives for trash can it happen exactly would tea or I saw the night before and the Dow but all they gave me a chance for our body\nI was younger I didn't know what it was how you lie or own\nFascinating very cool so you can be deeply ... in his room\nYes they can um there are multiple um experiences and reports of\nPeople that have ah let's just say knowledge of events are not only in the past but in the future or what we would perceive as a future you know it's interesting that you bring this up when you leave your body there is no time\nAs we know we look at time is linear but yet those of us who have out of body experience is quickly realize that for instance you can live a life in five minutes\nIt's ... it's there was no time as we perceive it and then non physical reality it's a whole ... all that that's why it's important to learn about the the dynamics of our true home are true reality which\nIs non physical 'cause it everything functions and a little different than it does here [noise] uh and that's why it's important to begin to read or at least learn about how non physical reality functions\nAnd fascinating can you ask in along it makes you appreciate it and we and can you asked in going into and out of money in\nAnd media destiny question or how does he get something out that really going into the future more than he giving out your huh\nCan you can ask anything matter of fact that's one of the things I Try to\nUm teach people is to be open to asking if you have a question asked to get the universe is willing to provide the answers your higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that\nIt wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance\nYour higher self or your higher mind however you perceive that it wants to assist you if you're open to that assistance and there is no limit to what can be it let's just say obtained um there's literally no limit\n... but you have to ask yeah\nThat's great [noise] um [noise] let's see if you go to our a wild card line you berry in St Louis Hi Danny how are you\nHighly ... take my call\nI had a question you your guest um years ago while we were out of town I did I ever really close to the past subtly while we were out of town and um we hold back and I just didn't let on my lap view him to be in a casket so I didn't go\nOff and I was upset about that and I had this dream and that was aimed at least but at the time\nAnd I was ... that threw a ... a mall very familiar with but what I made the term I mean it was my dad he was standing there who right there and it wasn't fuzzy or not it was my dad ... and I said to him I just said dad and he he held his hand up\nAnd he said you need to settle down and it's okay\nAnd uh I I Want to talk to him but he was actually fading out and I was I said to him I said dad don't leave pleased Elise and he was gone and I walk up\nBut after I woke up I I it's stress and everything was all gone and I guess my question is\nWhy this dream of that 'cause I was stressed out about it and it was in my imagination or or does she think that maybe that was my dad actually contacted me from the ... you know life after death round settled down because it actually worked\nYeah I think it was I mean that's reported by my God countless people report that kind of contact and often it's perceived as a dream like experience uh the universe is a continuum of consciousness and dreams are part of that continue on\nAnd yes the people\nEspecially in within thirty days of an individual passing\nThe the the chance of contact is incredibly high a and often will perceive it and a dream like environment because we're more open\nWhen our ego mind is when we fall asleep or Hugo mind set aside and we can begin to experience is but yeah I think that was a valid absolutely valid or\nMm uh I Know I've had that with my mother on many occasions and almost everybody I Know it's had some form of contact and that kind of regard with a loved one\nIt sounds very healing yes\nIt ... it is very healing I I think that's a wonderful experience\nAnd I think your intention was right to be a father in ... you remember him", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "14"}
