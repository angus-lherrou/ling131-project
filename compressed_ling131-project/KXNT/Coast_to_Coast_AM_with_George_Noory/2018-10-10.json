come back to ... with us author partner at the sherpas technology group in Silicon valley a former investment banker with UPS in New York His world view has been turned upside down in the late to two thousand sixteen period when he was exposed to world changing science\nWhich suggested that country the mainstream assumptions consciousness has not produced by the brain now after researching extensively he wrote this book in the end the upside down thinking to introduce all of us to these cutting edge ideas and here he is on the coast to coast I've got this really shocked you initially mark didn't it\nAbsolutely shocked me thank you for having me on\nI'm looking forward to this too I always ask questions of gas scientists and people who are experts on the brain\nDoes consciousness exist outside of the brain or not now the pure scientists Joe the medical professional folks mark\nWould always say you have to have the brain in order to have consciousness in the brain dies it all goes with it and I've always thought now there's something else here with consciousness you finally found out did you\n[noise] I did and I I was very squarely in what's known as the material is science camp which suggests that the universe is fundamentally made a matter there was a big bang about Thirteen point eight billion years ago killing the universe with physical material that we call matter\nAnd when you have enough matter in this universe you're bound to get interactions between those pieces of matter we call that chemistry\nWhen you have enough random chemical reactions you're ... you're bound to end up with\nA self replicating molecule like DNA chance\nIt leads to the evolution of living organisms like a human being the human being developed the brain and consciousness awareness comes out of the brain that's the perspective and if you buy into that which I used to then when the brain dies consciousness dies memories are gone so\nWhen you think about meaning in life if you take the material is perspective very strictly there can't be any meaning because once one is dead there's no memories there is no consciousness and that's the prevailing perspective as you mentioned in in narrow science and most of science today\nNo you know your model I Would lose money in a scene that you would write a book called how did you\nI Would have lost money too [laughter] so\nIt was about two years ago when I first learned of these phenomenon as I said I was totally materialist that's what I Would call it now in hindsight\nBut I I randomly stumbled across pod cast that started talking about these ideas I was actually listening to a health podcast called extreme health radio and the next one in the queue was a woman who talked about energy and psychic abilities that she had and at the end of that her name is Laura Powers\nShe mentioned that she had her own podcast called healing powers\nAnd I said oh that's interesting and I just decided to put it on driving from San Francisco to my office down further in the peninsula and I listen to a different episodes and people there were many different people who've talked about things that I Would have considered to be paranormal like psychic abilities the ability for consciousness to survive bodily debt things I had no familiarity with\nAn overtime just hearing enough different people describing similar perspectives unreality I got curious and so I started looking at the research and then discovered a whole body of science that put into question everything that I thought was real\nAnd this was a very jarring and disorienting realization for me because I thought life was meaningless\nAnd here I was discovering that maybe the brain isn't the producer of consciousness maybe the brain's more like an antenna or a filtering mechanism that process is consciousness and the identity that we have is not\nTied to the body so that totally freaked me out and a change in my world view completely led me down the path of intense research because I needed to rethink all of reality spent about a year of basically nonstop research outside of the office outside of my day job in finance and consulting\nAnd as I was doing that I told friends overtime at first I was kind of afraid to tell people about it because it sounded so outlandish but once I got a hold of the research I told people about it and the reactions I got were actually very positive and these were people who like me didn't have any familiarity with topics\nUm and and people told me that their lives are actually shifting in a positive direction after we had these conversations and after they heard about some of the science which will discuss tonight so after hearing enough of this feedback and also seeing that I had intense passion for this topic I decided to put my thoughts on paper and just organize my thoughts and see what happened\nSo it was July Fourth weekend in two thousand Seventeen which was a four day weekend\nAnd I said okay let me see what happens I locked myself in my apartment in San Francisco and decided to write and I kind of channeled my inner investment banker I used to be an investment banker in New York during the financial crisis so I just worked nonstop for four days and ended up writing more than half of the book that is now out\nAnd then finish it over the next few weekends so all of a sudden I'm here at the end of July twenty Seventeen with a manuscript\nAnd ultimately a cold email bill Gladstone who's now my agent at my publisher multiple people recommended that I reach out to him I sent him a cold email and I was fortunate to get a positive response from him and bill represents Eckhart totally\nMeal Donald Walsh um and so that's where we are now\nI in in ... to upside down thinking\nI\nConsider upside down thinking to be the material is perspective that we start with matter and we end up with consciousness\nThrough a brain so the brain creates consciousness what I now see to be the more likely picture reality is one in which consciousness is primary existing beyond space and time so instead of saying we get we start with matter and end up with consciousness\nConsciousness comes first\nRight with out the brain does consciousness exist at all and the answer is yes correct\nThat's what I think the evidence suggests no word science back us up\n[noise] so my book is the scientific evidence suggesting that that idea is true and there are a number of phenomenon that suggest that there is a consciousness existing independently ever functioning body so one example is chapter nine or I talked about near death experiences and if you'd asked me a few years ago what's in your experience\nI Would if that isn't that just to host nation that happens when someone that out to a diet like a evolutionary mechanism that allows people to feel better before they're going to die\nI started looking at the research and realize that it's not that simple uh first of all what's described it in near death experiences is typically a very lucid enriched type of consciousness is not one that you would expect when there's minimal or no brain function at all\nAnd even more than that we find instances in which people accurately report what happened during the time that their brain was either not very functional or it was completely off like in cardiac arrest\nIt's known as they ... out of body experience so the person it out of his or her body when their bodies not functional and they're seeing things in the room they come back to their body after the near death experience and they accurately report what happens so that it suggests to some kind of consciousness existing independently of the body\nMarks website mark Goldberg dot com

peers say and your colleagues when you wrote this book did it surprise you some\nIt's a great question I'm often asked that I Would say yes they were very surprised to hear that but I think I Hope people about the evidence that I was referring to people perked up and we're interested in the fact that I was taking the time to research and write a book on this topic\nNow let's talk a little bit about some of the things you uncovered that you didn't really know about before telepathy pre cognition tell look is a cycle ... says you you of course learned a little bit about them but you learn more as you did more be research didn't you\nYeah absolutely I mean prior to I Would say two plus years ago I hadn't heard of these topics beyond science fiction I had no idea there was actual science controlled study that hadn't been done on these topics and I have a chapter on each of those topics that you mentioned where I go through what I think is the best evidence that exist today\nNow let's talk about ... what did you uncover here and let's find out your explanation my aunt who was a psychiatrist at the time devoted her entire career to investigating telepathy and uh she came up she came out with some astounding things but what did you find\nIt yeah I thought that the the very important phenomenon it's it's mind my communication and just taking a quick step back the reason that I Am each of these phenomenon is that I read them that the material is perspective that consciousness comes from and his localized to the brain\nThat perspective cannot account for things like ... the and the other things will talk about and I read them that if any of these phenomena are real the material is perspective is not work well whereas a consciousness centric picture does work\nSo well apathy to me the most compelling evidence is a a procedure known as the guns held experiment and the basic design is as follows and I should say that these studies have been done over many decades by many different experimenter and when you can find the result\nThe statistics are very compelling mhm doctor dean rating who just wrote a book called real magic\nHis book called six sigma six sigma refers to statistical odds against chance when you get a six sigma result the odds that that that the effect is just happening by chance is more than a billion to one and in telepathy we have six sigma results\nSo the guns not experiment the study has one person in a room we'll call him Bob it very very relaxing state listening to relaxing music there's another person let's call her Jane who's in another room\nJane has given a picture by the experiment there's an experimenter say Jane I Know this sounds crazy but I Want you to mentally send a picture of this thing that you're looking at to Bob while he's in the other room\nSo jaded mentally sending this image to Bob Bob is then at the end shown for pictures he doesn't know what picture game was looking at\nWe would predict if there were no effect at all at Bob would guess correctly one out of four times twenty five percent\nRight now I'm going to be the ... the law of probability would tell you that\nRight especially over many decades and different experimenter as we would expect that we would approach twenty five percent with more and more trials but instead it's closer to thirty two percent\nSo from a statistical standpoint even though it sounds like a small effect is twenty five versus thirty two this is massive statistically it suggests that something is getting through and it actually conforms to our common sense our everyday experience because if we were one hundred percent ... then we would know each other's thoughts all the time\nYou're instead it's actually more subtle where you think of somebody and then they catch you or they call you and that might be what we're seeing here with thirty two versus twenty five percent that it's a subtle effect that everyday people experience\nWhat could increase ... percent mark is at the center or the receiver\n\n[noise] this is something that that needs to be explored much more ah but what we see with people who tend to be more psychic for example people that had been a has had been involved in the U.S government studies which we can talk about later they tend to go into a trance like state and\nPeople who are better ... seem to have enhanced psychic abilities that seems to be an emerging finding\nI've always wondered though if somebody is really tuned into certain things they can pick up all kinds of different events without really having the sender\nHaving much to do with it I I I think that's a receiver might have a better effect in changing the outcome\nI think that's probably true people that tend to have heightened abilities whether it's ... or communications with the deceased\nThrough medium ship these are people that tend to be picking up information\nAnd if we use the analogy of the brain as being like an antenna which is not precise but it's it's helpful metaphor where there's a consciousness that's not localized to the body those who are able to better configure their antenna so to speak are better able to pick up signals whether it's from a particular standard or from something else\nNow what would have happened had you gone to the receiver person in the room\nAnd simply not show them any of them for pictures but they just had to tell you what they think she said to them what do you think would happen\nWell well I think we'd have a distribution first of all we had just an everyday person versus a talented psychic if we had a talented psychic than we'd probably get some some pretty strong cats and that's what we saw with the U.S government\nUh but if it's an everyday person I think it would be a different more difficult study to examine because the effect is so small\nLet's talk about the U.S government studies and the things that they've conducted we know\nInterested in this for very long time\nYes and again this is something that was very new to me I'm the program is sometimes referred\nTo as Stargate Program and use psychic buys for national security purposes many of marine I've been on the show by the white\nYep during the Cold War and and the people who were involved in it were a laser physicist at Stanford University there were many reviewers who are involved to say this was a real so there are many people talking about the fact that this was real\nI'm In my book I I have some documents from the CIA which had been declassified recently\nAnd the phenomenon that that was being studied was typically the telepathy was one remote viewing is the primary one which is the ability to perceive something at a distance without being physically so it's like you could see something in your mind that's far away without even being there without seeing it with your eyes\nIt sounds completely paranormal if consciousness is localized to the brain but if consciousness is non local than it's at least conceivable\nDocuments um say explicitly and I am looking at it right now remote viewing is a real phenomenon this\nIs from a declassified documents that has been released recently [laughter] so I mean for someone like me who's just trying to objectively look at evidence if I thought something like that in my business world that I had a consulting case for example that's really strong evidence whether one wants to believe it or not that to me at least made me question things\nUm even further than that there's a page on science panel and there are some very credible people including someone from Cal Tech\nThe next page in the document says science panel's report principle findings either direct quotes implications are revolutionary evidence to impressive to dismiss as mere coincidence\nYou know in many cases many cases we have looked at these uh tell a path to studies and I've always wondered\nIf the government really never stopped doing it but continued now I've asked some of the people who've been involved in these studies\nThat just that same question and they said no it stopped because they would have kept us on they would have used a ... I'm not sure what the government has found other people and they've continued these kinds of mine the studies\nWell certainly there were some successes recorded in the program during the Cold War for example former President Jimmy Carter confirmed that remote viewers were used\nTo find a downed Russian bomber in an African jungle that they couldn't find so there was some utility to the program whether it was reliable all the time or not is another question but sometimes it was useful\nSo you'd have to think that if if it were a useful thing to be doing that or organizations would be trying it\nPre cognition mark the very valuable tool for people in their life because of the ability to sense things make decisions based on those gut feelings and to react to them now a lot of people don't react\nThey don't do it it's something happens when they go oh I should have done that and I I knew what\nWhat is your view of pre cognition\nSo there are some studies which show a very subtle pre cognition known as pre sentiments where the bodies sensing something very subtly and we need to stick to ... to show it before something happens\nAnd there are other examples where it's much more explicit where a person has a dream known as a ... dream the dream something and then the next day it happened exactly as they dreamed it\nRemember when you couldn't order a ride and the principal going or get on line without hearing them for dominoes delivered to over a hundred and fifty thousand unexpected outdoor location wait what\nIntroducing dominoes hotspots you can finally get to eat the delivered right to the beach the cost for the dog park [noise] not at all not a problem fight a dominoes hot spot near you and your two medium to topping pizza delivered for five Ninety nine each to\nLet him know and if he's we after aspirin unlimited time on the prices are just pushed into the ... from the justice a hard\n... studios ... north Las Vegas ...

some cases the medical records are found so it's it's something that's beyond genetics beyond environment which are the two factors typically considered to affect the physical\nSomething else was going on and the researchers call it a third factor\nFor a person's petrified of water and then somehow hypnosis they died in the past life by drawing\nExactly so it's preferences and fears that somehow or transferred to something beyond the body seems to be a transfer from wanting to distance to another offensively\nWe have Monique in someone California with us I'm Monique\nHi George and yeah I have a question for your gas sure how\nI thank you for a ban on the show\nSo I'm back in two thousand and one I experience actually I told Tom it was seven but it was actually six mental tell a path experiences within one week\nAnd I had a spiritual revelation that made me become vegetarian and an instant now there was no one around no um food no animals that I was by myself\nAnd I guess I'm I I like to know people that are tell a path that now you said that people are are usually good with meditation I I haven't done a lot of ... meditation in my life but I have been on my own a\nA tremendous amount of time I'm at\nA deep thinker I'm spiritual\nAnd I think I'm an empathetic person so I wanted to know\nIf these qualities allow people to be more tell a path again in addition for about twenty two years I've seen double and triple digit I'm On the clock on you know addresses license plates and whatnot and the phenomena\nHas become bigger and society at the time I didn't know what was going on and people didn't understand what I was trying to tell them but um I kind of thinking that this might be a telecast experience as well seeing something like two two two on the clock\nI'm thinking important message it you know something important in your life seeing signs so I kinda think that it's all intertwined and then just one more thing I'm\nFemale awhile ago someone had told me I'm In the spirit and the solar actually different I I Believe and maybe the Bible or some religions it's the body and mind spirit soul and so I kind of think that what you're saying is differentiating\nBetween ... list it's like the spirit of or the soul of the person is is it's outside and the spirit inside her or either or but um I I kinda think of it on a spiritual level what you're saying as well\nI Would think more than ... maybe one would you say\nThank you for your question on the um I tend to agree with you George and there's an analogy I Love also from Dr Bernardo Castro which summarizes the way I think about things\nWhich is to imagine reality as being like a stream of water where water represents consciousness and each of us is like a world pool within that stream so we're having a localized individual experience within the broader stream but we are fundamentally still made out of water\nSo what happens when the physical body dies that's like a world full dissipating and the water doesn't leave the stream it just transitions into a different state and so the water to me of consciousness and consciousness is having this variety of experiences whether localized in the world will or otherwise industry\nDo you think that's consciousness\nIs a normal process of living or it's cheaper natural\nThe way I view consciousness is that it's like max plump she said I regard consciousness\nMatter as to rebut if from consciousness meaning that consciousness is the basic underpinning of reality and quantum mechanics and other things point to that but I Do everything that we experience as being a basically a modulation that is happening within consciousness\nHow is this new knowledge for you more changed your life\nIt's changed it massively [laughter] so I alluded to this earlier that the material is perspective that I subscribe to a leads to a very bleak outlook on life once your brain's off it's over\nI mean I understood the implications of that and I think that's what our education system is teaching um now I think that that consciousness does not die when the body dies because consciousness isn't dependent on the body\nSo I see much more uh ... meaning in life there's another phenomenon that I think is really really important and I I think I Wish this had been talk to me a long time ago but going back to the near death experiences what people often report is known as a life review\nWhere they experience their whole life in a flash and again this is when their brain is either offer highly impaired\nAnd they're judging themselves for how they acted during their life but this is the kicker that really I think about this every day is that some people report experiencing the life review through the eyes of those they affected\nSo let's say Bob harmed chain in his life and Bob is having a life review he might experienced the pain through James eyes\nAnd he comes back to his life forever changed carrying much more about uh how we treat people rather than material goods so it will be talking about meaning in life the life review as a potential lens if we take that as a literal phenomenon about you know the purpose here is really to treat one another well\nDo you think in our life that we were given this gift to be able to do these incredible things\nThrough consciousness free cognition to lump in the ... and things like\nThat well yeah I think that these are natural abilities that we tend to have in the telepathy study I mentioned earlier where people are thirty two percent rather than twenty five percent there's the subtle ability even ... in people who aren't trained\nI think their abilities that are just simply not harness in modern society because these ideas are considered anomalous than totally paranormal and this is one of the reasons I wanted to write the book and salt so compelled to do it is that\nAn understanding human potential and these abilities that we have could revolutionize I think the world but also our science in our medicine if we understood how to incorporate them into what we do\nFirst time caller John in Flint, Michigan welcome to the show John go ahead\nYou doing sir great\nI'm an ex military and I will tell you I don't believe in ghosts UFOs and everything else but I Will say that again retired military I was assigned to a multinational units two thousand six and Iraq\nWere by the way you were serving\nGave that I was assigned to an empty every intelligence unit and we basically we're looking for a bomb maker\nUm we were able to use what I understand if he remote viewing from a section of the three intelligent shop where there was a coal location for a boss and some buildings\nWere able to find that three UAB and the person I Believe who was the remote viewer that was brought in a was ball and I believe he wasn't no final\nWhich is I Know it sounds odd but uh he spoke broken English I Believe he was Israeli descent from what I can get of who I dealt with over there mhm my question is that again I don't\nAny of this other stuff but I Do believe in remote viewing\nBecause of his I guess you would say non English or not American ... uh I guess association with nationality is there any research or anything where there's a culture or a nationality that is more than ... ...\nNot necessarily not not not because of nationality or anything like that I haven't come across that mark I mean there are ... there were great remote viewers all over the planet or but it doesn't skew anything specifically\nI Would say that it just it with what I've seen so far but I think more\nResearch it deserved on this topic isn't being research widely enough to understand if there are certain trend there are certain brain configuration that make people more able to do these things\nAnd in your case mark the definition of remote viewing would be wiped\nThe ability to proceed something with the mind around\nIt's almost as if the mind alone has ... outside of the body\nCorrect the going back to the whirlpool analogy it's like somebody is able to accept another part of the stream even though they're localized in their individual whirlpool it's like they open up their whirlpool and they accept water the outside\nI wanted to go back to John are veteran here and ask him a question John you're still with us Yes sir I ... so you do or you you believe in remote viewing\nBut it's it's it's tied into all these other things it's all part of the whole so what would it take to get you to believe the other things outside of UFOs 'cause you know that's that's subjective to everybody\nOn unfortunately it with me only because of my background it would be you know personal experience I uh [noise] a lot of things that I

...\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast our final segment with mark ... market can we conclude that consciousness\nIs a part of the universe always was and that it survives outside of the physical brain than physical body but it's there it's out there in the ether I mean can we categorically all agree on that\nTo me the evidence points in that direction more strongly than any other direction when you put together the phenomenon that we've discussed night a psychic phenomena like left at the psycho can eat as pre cognition\nNear death experience as children with at like memories when you put all these together combined with certain phenomena of quantum physics\nIt's they get that consciousness playing the fundamental role in the universe beyond space and time\nWe've got George in Corpus Christi Texas now hey George welcome to the bird ...\nGeorge ah may God Bless you and your show and the bus and you're\nThinking this wonderful really wonderful\nAnd my ah my question is whether you've got hundreds of colors a reincarnation as a result of consciousness living outside the body and each of us\nAnd the so AKA consciousness moves on to affect another human being good or evil how just free will play a part in or effect consciousness and I'll take my reply on rent those\nTo do with it mark\nThis is a very tricky question I think the question or free will get ultimately boils down to who is the agent that we're speaking out that has the free well\nUm are we talking about the the body having free will are we talking about the the consciousness itself and if we think of consciousness as being like the stream of water than all there is is consciousness\nSo at the level of the fundamental consciousness it would appear that there is a infinite free well but at the level of perhaps at an individual that is\nConsidering itself to be separated from that consciousness or at least appearing that way then perhaps the free well did not exist at the same level that that makes sense\nYeah it does ... on a very difficult subject\nIt's very difficult and I think there are some of the concept that we're talking about tonight I think are beyond what what are linear human mind can conceptualize sort of like insanity we all know entity exists but what can we really understand what it means I think there are certain concepts that our brains just limit us from understanding falling\nYou'd think somebody like Jesus understood the ability of consciousness and how to how to deal with is how to use it a Andy Andy used it\nI I think there were probably people throughout history\nUm who really understood the nature of reality and I don't know the details of how Jesus might've interplay with consciousness but from the bits and pieces I I've heard it's possible that he was one of these individuals who really understood\nHow things work and it seems that when one understands reality perhaps we can do things that seem totally paranormal but again they're not paranormal under this alternative framework\nWe have a guest his name's Joe ... a gallon burger and he's a he's a professor and he is conducted experiments in Las Vegas one of his books is called liquid luck he has concluded beyond a shadow of the doubt\nThat the ability of the mind and attitude will determine whether you win or lose and his studies in Las Vegas where he's tested and in in the Senate John Candy so if somebody goes in the Las Vegas\nOffbeat positive\nUh there's a high likelihood they're going to win but if they go in we're going to lose this isn't going to happen they're going to lose and and he said the results were uncanny\nI think that's all tied together like consciousness it's all part of the same don't you\nI'm not familiar with those exact studies but I'm very open to the idea for the reason that you just states that have consciousness is the basis of reality where everything is just the stream of consciousness than the reality we're in is almost malleable\nAnd sometimes it's very subtle where you have a random number generator that's behaving slightly non randomly in other cases we have reports like he talked about a metal being that using the mind\nSo who's to say that outcomes which is just a part of the physical reality could also be affected by the way our consciousness is acting\nEast of the Rockies Beaumont, Texas we go James waiting for a cello James\n... Ah yes real quickly before oh make my favorite I like the uh respect of this disagree with a that a field of view about the effects of a drug this Bush in the fall and the mind you know it's an indicator\nThat consciousness is a product of the mine ... I'm\nA you know as you the person speak them into a tape recorder as an example um you know if that example would be uh\nUh the play back of the tape recorder or you know if the typing wrinkles clinical do something will end up playing it just started a board a distortion that would be an example of the drugs mine\nYou know it's not the consciousness but that's the effect of the apparatus there's I'm bringing about a distortion\nOf what's consciousness put in it so it's not coming out in this to clarity that's you know the wholesome of consciousness that went to is [noise] uh but anyway uh I think the prime example of a\nA spirit living outside of the body is that the self when you have a Gulf hunting so you have a the example of active consciousness uh this existing outside of the by that I'm\nAble to levitate have knowledge of events that you know maybe it shouldn't uh otherwise um till the ... and everything else I think that's the prime example of consciousness uh outside of the body right there\nWhen you think of them are well there are studies using on mediums people who can communicate with the deceased is related to what James was just describing and they're actually controlled studies that have been done at the wind bridge Research Center\nAnd these studies are use five levels of blinding where the media and the person who allegedly can communicate with the deceased\nIs speaking on the phone to the researcher and all that person knows is the first name of the dead person and they're able to bring in non chance information and there have been to peer reviewed journal studies on this they just think that the mediums are able to\nObtain information we need more research on it but that's an example of someone who appears to be deceased and a living person getting information about someone who is deceased\nWhere do you think in some mediums do you think some of them are very effective\nAt erasing an important point I think there's a tendency um I think in the mainstream to say that there are frauds out there that are claimed to be mediums and maybe there are some fraud I think there are some people that that have real abilities and the ... Research Center as one example where they\nThey heavily screen the mediums and these people are able to do things you can explain\nI'm also looking back historically there are many cases back sometimes from the Eighteen hundreds of people that were studied rigorously one is named Mrs piper\nAnd she was studied by William James the ... the famous psychologist and a detective follows her around to make sure that she couldn't get information from normal sources and she was able to do things that were amazing so I think it's possible that some people have extraordinary abilities\nLet's go west Steven's with us in Eugene Oregon now Hi Stephen\nGood evening Hi jarred were always saying there's no such thing as coincidence right I'm ...

and it happened like four times [laughter]\nThat was playing around with you\nThere yeah the lobby was completely jeeze and it happened like four times [laughter]\nNot where they're making good chess moves\nAre really that game had just started I wouldn't know\n[laughter] oh I'm actually in their goals\nI actually got I felt I was like I'm I'm finished\n[laughter] ... you know this sounds a little like\nA sound like ... ... says of course Ron have you seen objects move when you've been on a a case\nDo absolutely it of course I just told you earlier about the book that flew off the shelf yeah but it's hardly he says that there's a famous case of a a Boston sports writer who was friends with a wrestler by the name of that who was the angel French angel or something like that\nAnd uh he used to play chess on all the time and eventually this this wrestling died\nAnd he had a a a death best mate or or or a buster is his head\nAnd he bought one of those like chronic chess game which is so he's he like just continue playing but then he realized one day the chess thing was never applied then\nUh he actually called it a couple of people from the the at the University of ... in Boston and they couldn't explain that they moved to the bus the ... and everything and ah we continue to make these moves even though it wasn't\nA plugged in and he swears that he believes that was his friend he a fringe angel ... still playing chess with them in the afterlife\nHow many of these events in a entities are mischief makers as opposed to trying to hurt somebody\n\nI think it's it's overblown as far as trying to hurt somebody um I mean Maureen in line so for gun I'm On an extra systems with the Catholic Church what we're talking demons versus a you know ...\nYou know knew that there are\nSome ... there are nasty and uh to be quite honest with you or having a trance channeling channel is sometimes like Maureen can be a little\nA nerve wracking because uh there are some versus actually don't like me and when you give them a body they've uh\nYou know they they use it sometimes she's drawn to rush on line [noise] she's throwing me across the room before dislocated my finger and a couple of things so early in the air it can't be nasty but I I think the the most of them are really not\nMarie ... you've written about Ron having your back what does that mean exactly\nYeah you know one have made that we've worked together for so many years on and then the beginning you know if I started to ... you know he would try to call me back meaning weight you know whether you're weightless I'm an opera came army and what's going on you know it's getting too dangerous\nAnd you know it took us a little while to get that rhythm on why would talk to Iran and say you know in my mind I Know what I might appear to be out of control in my mind and actually you know talking to the spirit or trying to you know to\nConnect more or get into more and what they're wanting and what's going on\nSo now I Know I Know that if I Need him to pull me out to help me in a situation that's not safe um he's right there so that you have in my back and and then if not he'll kind of make sure people don't kind of touched me and go near me to allow me that space to do and I need to do\nLove scooter urban in a state of Maine urban welcome to the program\nAll right thanks for taking my call your thing do\nThe state of Maine urban welcome to the program\nAll right thanks for taking my call your thing do love\nYour show 'em ... along because as a I live in a house gets to hundred and five years old\nAnd my age at which I've read so Monday haunted experiences that house it's crazy it's actually kinda funny rarely 'cause I I uh really only have a nice like hope the guy's activity when I was I'm trying to fix the house\nIf I like Jay do something on the inside a one time we had gone I've been doing some you all get the majority in the house and I come home and ah\nThe there was the cabin door about three feet away from my style that have been ripped off and driven down through my laptop though it was like if you're not part of their\nKnees or when I go I go into my bedroom and it would take him to one of my TV say strays and you know that wouldn't be kind of set off the front of the house yeah it does make them that set it off on my bed ...\nAnd ah I think I ... I I my wife and my kids have actually seen a kid and a lady ah I I actually I've never seen those but I heard um I've heard like the footsteps I'd read slamming doors\nSo you're pretty convinced or they're\nAll there is no doubt about it [laughter] or absolutely my uh I guess my question is is why ... why wouldn't have to try to do something to fix the house is that when they seem to be\nWildly they probably don't want any changes to the house who do you think Maureen\nYou are right on George um think about it if you put all your effort into a home and you made it what you thought was the best I mean it was wonderful and then you know you're still there and you're looking at it from a different side and now people are starting to change it you know sometimes that can actually started things out\nNo question about that it's just amazing how many different kinds of entities are out there to do whatever they do some are fun some we're having a good time other evil what decides whether they're good or bad to Ron in terms of that\nI think it's it's who you are and this this life and if you don't change you're pretty much who you are on the next life so you have to deal with the court accordingly um there were some times\nWhen I um don't speak nicely to um as as some people like in ... but they don't deserve that respect it's it's you know if there are a beginning and knowing or being\nA offensive to to those who are running this realm now it's it's you know they don't deserve and they you know super respect though\nIt's going to Giovanni in Los Angeles and load Giovanni\nHey how's it going jarred since well thanks I'm and I'm Glad to be back last you got to find coughing again choosing a wrong\nGreen he's safe out there be careful with with or without enough that you guys are\nYou know you guys are exploring with uh I Know it can be really dangerous I just wanted to share a little story of mine is really quick [noise] ah I ... truck driving right now but I I still do security from time to time\nOne of the places like the security with our cat was a um a building called the malls that building and here in downtown LA it's pretty old building it's one of them\nBut the places I carry with our at was a um a building called the mall that building in your in downtown LA it's pretty old building is one of those buildings that kind of at the at the time you architecture and all that stuff\nBut um it's so definitely ... I Know I I I one night especially I was I was working we have these monitors that a camera set up all around every floor building and there's several floors does the word um\nAnd the monitors are set up to be most of them do that every time somebody come in or out on the cleaning lady or something like that the monitors withdrawn\nAnd I have you ever caught one on tape [noise] you know what I I totally shatters I've seen and it always happens on the corner of your eyes hired this quick darkness\nAnd it is that hackers and dating\n...\nDot com boy download them react against\nAny agent hackers in data miners are being more important to protect your personal information now you can with nice thing that the only ... the way you do science safely in complete control nice you know 'cause I ain't secure communications with private browser virtual clinic high standards that security features that you can actually shopping sounds socialize\nAnd I think if you let her get out just down the mail more credit card games usually like to do I need to stay safe here and I found them my see now some sorts and get more than you're free to do this\nOn used ... D [noise]\n\nWe are back what's wrong the collection Maureen would our final segment here ... more ghost chronicles Ron where do we get your book\nWell it's a sold everywhere Amazon and uh\nAll the major bookstores so\nI was only not Maureen that our dear friend Jeff ... Roche you're a forward to the ...\nOh yeah just for a a yeah go way back he he was always been my mentor when I first went into goes type thing I went on the Web site on the Web which was new and that was the largest site on the ... village so that's a since then we've become really good friends\nJust technology continue to make ghost haunting easier\nUh probably easier but not better not better quicker than it\nDoes a lot of um things out there some of them are really junk science but ah yeah I don't know I mean\nSpirited around for you know hundreds and hundreds of years\nAnd ah they didn't have a lot of technical stuff back then yet people still had experiences though had great experiences and and seeing them and everything else I don't know we need a ... you know it reminds me of you know all the physical ship stuff the weeds you boards and\nThose were those were designed so that they could eliminate the medium because people want to go directly and that's kind of what these electronic devices that doing this there are trying to get the goes type to to deal directly with her and not have to go through a meeting or not have to you know almost on demand type of thing but\nIt's yeah I mean there are there are some um\nBetter pieces equipment up there and there are some that that of course but you know there's nothing wrong with the good thermal imaging camera or a good uh I our camera or a good record\nAnd Maureen how 'bout you will technology or change things\nUm you know I honestly don't think that technology has reached the point that makes it more sensitive than human being you know and then what we can censor ourselves on and we may be getting close with some areas that they're you know they're finding out but honestly I don't think it's sensitive enough yet\nSo you're not going to be replaced by a robot ghost investigator anytime\nSharon [laughter] I don't I don't think so\nAll right let's go to a final calls here let's go to Z Hastings, Florida bill's with us and bill are you in a safe haven there were ... hurricane headed your way\nOr the other side of the state we're south of St Augustine so I think we're uh we're probably going to be safe on this one okay let's pray that everybody else is going to do\nYeah I had a ghost story for you or when we came down here about eight years ago in Florida we were at a a paranormal investigation and the old Spanish military hospital in St Augustine\nAnd down here about eight years ago in Florida we were at the paranormal investigation if you'll Spanish Military hospital and clean Oregon State which is known to be haunted and why we were there ghost\nOh this was in the middle of the night it goes to actually made a table moved slightly up on the second floor\nSo we went up to the second floor and we were able to communicate with the ghost wife Susan and I and some other people that were there and we [noise] we had a a mini man flashlight on a table and the ghost could answer our questions by making the light link\nAnd a ... various questions and to some guy to indicate that his name was when we and then it was a was a been a nurse at a at the hospital at one time during the Spanish period in\nSt Augustine and up at the time my auntie um I had a brief case with me and I was carrying around a large amount of money and then subsequently um for about the next year or so time to time we'll hear clicking noises that goes for teasing me that he was opening a briefcase\nI Love you know while I'm gone for the oil would happen is um if I drop like little\nI don't care for all of a chair or something I'm length list about I'm not last July but the one before that in the middle of the night was having a little plane bottled camper something fell off the chair and it's fun and\nLike a high percentage speed down floor\nWhy are they mischief makers wrong ... what are they trying to accomplish by pleading around like\nSometimes the the just the tension seekers they they just want to be seen or heard other words that you know where I Am here pay attention or if you've ever a cat for instance the cats are pretty much like that to a you know they'll they'll come in and do silly things to\nWhat you know they're there and have pay attention to me so I I think that's that's primary it\nBut uh I I have to tell a funny story about the a book I wanted to my next door neighbor and ... and the\nNext day I came back I met her and she came back with the book and she said hey if they could back she says we were reading the or the first chapter and I was having a glass of wine and my glass shattered\nSo she says I don't want anything to do with it [laughter] it's like glass shuttering books in the ... thing to do anything really what they want to do I believe\nNext and tweets Tom what do you have a this woman from Sarah in Rochester [laughter] I'm curious to run more and more green can recommend ways to remain ... from coming knew a person's life ... into someone's why let's give that to you more you know\nOkay so I think given me the rumbling\n[laughter] we'll get home made really ...\nYeah I'm honestly I'm a big believer with the St Michael so I Know for me there's a few things one is intention if you know if you're looking for that and you're believing that evils coming into your life and you know it's very possible that you're you could invited in\nOn the other thing is I for instance I have a granddaughter who is you know too young to do that sort of thing but she's picking up spiritually she thinks spirits are ready um so what we're doing is we had a St Michael's prayer card that I put underneath you know her mattress and in her pillow and I have different varying crystals\nAround the room to how much energy\nAnd she's doing a lot better so I Know you know and again it's a belief\nVery crystals around the room for how many energy\nOn and she is doing a lot better so I Know you know and again it's a belief right so I Believe it works on its intention networks I think if you have a\nBelief in yourself as well on you can tend to have bought out bought out most times would say you were on what about it\nWell I agree with it away and and you judge because you talk about the the hurry came in your intention sure make good yeah so and tensions\nAs a hundred percent but being a good old Catholic boy I rely on my religion of course and so that's that's what I always recommend\nYou you know and I've seen this happen before I've seen hurricanes go from a category four\nDown to two down to one and you know who's the sea prayer is the cause but hey you know what it word works\nYep crank Korea hundred percent with the judge\nSneak in any way we can let's go to bill in Idaho ... west of the Rockies Hi Bill go ahead\nI'm Sorry to say first that uh oh I think we should all get centered in our heart and intend to dissolve the third yeah I agree [noise]\n... ah question is probably more rain I ever been serving the land for the last six years here I feel is time for me to go back to serving man\nOf attempted to move in April when I had a series of events that showed me it was a time yet for my question is whether it'd be tough for me now to to leave our [noise]\nDid you do a quick little reading here Maureen sure any one moment okay\nWell you fully nothing would chat with Iran on this what's what are your next project Ron How often do you get cold to investigate\nWell we had quite a few uh you know I Would say you like it used to be daily but it's it's probably weekly now and uh we only choose the ones we really want to do basically uh uh\nYou get flooded with requests\nFor what we do get a lot of them to be honest with you judge so uh yeah it ... you've got to screen them somehow so which is difficult ...\nOkay well let's go back to bill in Idaho and a marine go ahead\nAll right so bell actually pulled the capital of cards and one was aspiration saying you know ...\nTo go after what you want right it's almost like a spiritual card that says you know you need to be empowered you this\nUm and it's getting a good idea right you'll know when that moment is right to actually make the change and it seems like it and working behind me off I hate and try to be nice\nI'm working really hard and it's time to kind of read some of those benefits and actually to move forward um obviously I Can't tell you what to do but I think that if you were to make a change now would be good looking at the time\nI'm going to return the kayak\nHow about a taxi\nShort far from your neighborhood here nature had the foresight to identify the neighborhood park or green space meaning you about the ... the U.S court survey\nListen and imagine [laughter] [noise]\nIt takes five

later it's a medicine going order so I don't know how that works but let's get a call ...\n... in alphabetical order so we'll go to be unreality radio everybody and we had a great show tonight we're going to be talking about dreams and uh we're going to be talking with Laney dolphin\nA dream analysis and see how it should be interesting if you haven't yet made sure your head over to Facebook dot com slash beyond reality radio like the Facebook page for us\nThen had to be under reality radio dot com you can find all the stations where across the country the list is constantly being updated you can also download the smart as smart app devices which uh you can download which he phones or tablets which allow you to listen live catch past shows joined the allied chat more\nUm well I'm a person who has great dream recall and I've had that kind of recall since I'm a little girl and so of course I've always been fascinated with dreams because of that and when I was Twenty one I had a major crisis in my life\nAnd I found that dream analysis\nAbsolutely miraculously I'm a helped me make a lifetime decisions and that was the first place I found out that the dream is actually the conversation that you are having with yourself\nConcerning a very specific current issue that you are attempting to problem solve and I'm Talking about this week by it because first I'm a first things first kind of girl [laughter] so I'm going to take you to the first level first and the solution\nTo something that's bugging you this week appears in your unconscious of course before it gets to your conscious and what I Do is I teach people the language of metaphor because it can give you an incredible opportunity to escape\nYour repetitive entire responses to people in situations\nThat most likely stemmed from childhood because everything stems from childhood [laughter]\nYou know when you're saying that when you when you're you're having a dream that you something going on in your life that we I mean there's\nA lot of people who have dreams of things that affected them earlier when they were when their children and teenagers or another partner lives\nRight right and and so what happens is your\nUnconscious mind is this vast incredible database that it's holding every single memory and association that you'll have ever had since you were born\nSo for example if I'm aggravated with Andy severe acute husband [laughter] but I'm just saying if I'm aggravated with him and I want to discuss something with myself when I go to sleep [noise] my filing cabinet you can tell I'm over fifty it's not a database it's a filing cabinets\nIt opens up ... and every single boy friend that I've ever had is all in the same file as Andy is and I might choose a boyfriend from ... you know a forty five years ago who\nIt made me feel\nPrecisely the same way that Andy made me feel today so we're ... we're so sophisticated me give you a dream because it's going to say at all when I tell you a dream it's going to say at all\nYeah we do okay so here's one of my favorite dreams which appears in my second book it's called the picnic dream and this woman\nThat she's at a picnic and there's a couple of aunts crawling around and I'm I'm a gonna teach you five as sorry six different points of entry that you can use to uncover while you had that dream last night so she says that there's a couple of events they're not really spoiling the picnic\nBut suddenly those and turn into a chord of aunts\nAnd she wakes up as she's pushing the all of them off her hands and so using a symbols point of entry I asked her what comes to your mind what is a picnic like imagine that I'm a little bit\nUsing a symbol ... point of entry I asked her what comes to your mind what is a picnic like imagine that I'm a little girl I have no idea what a picnic is she said to me it's when you eat outside of the house on a blanket and hopefully it's sunny and it's very pleasant and then I asked\nHer and what is eating and she said sustenance\nAnd the dream was about the fact that this woman was having an affair\nShe was getting her sustenance\nOutside of the house on a blanket\nLike that with the the metaphor that she used\nTo direct her to the fair that she was having and the reason there is an escalation of the feelings in the dream 'cause feelings is another point of entry because at first she's having such a nice time and then there's this horrid events that's\nEverywhere and that's how she wakes up and the escalating situation that became motive control\nIs that the guy she was having an affair with got transferred an hour and a half away\nFrom where they live so he had to move out of town\nAnd now she would have to drive an hour and a half to get to him probably another hour and a half or two hours to have the affair and then live another hour and a half to get back to where they live in enough time to pick up the children so this small and ...\nThat are not ruining the picnic at first are representative of her kids his kid it's her husband and his wife\nAnd the reason it turns into court events is because now she's gotten her self there's a situation that's completely out of control and so when you want to look for the solution to the issue that after forty five years I can promise you appears in your unconscious and\nYou get it anyway but if you don't remember your dreams here guinea you're getting it any way but you get it faster if you know how to analyze the dream and so\nOne of the ways that you couldn't find a solution is to take the picture of the dream out into waking life and I would ask are you guys JV and Jason is it effective in Syria and effective way to get rid of World War two events like pushing them away with your hands\nNo no\nExactly so the dream is reflecting the dreamers in appropriate response to her waking life situation and what I said to her was maybe want to get the ... 'cause rate\nWould kill a horrid events and so that that's all I'm using metaphor to help the dream or problem solve I'm not gonna tell her what\nShe is getting the radio for because that's not my that's not my thing I'm trying to point the dream or to help her say what the conclusion is for her and she called me a couple of days later to tell me she got up the raid and ended the affair\nOh I'm so you know you know back in your interpretation of which makes a lot of\nUm is it possible that\nYou know we could be looking at things like that in dreams and coming up multiple interpretation or ... something that you pretty well define that we know or someone like used do training and the Syrian you you're this green immediately make\nWell yeah 'cause I've been doing it for forty five years but it doesn't mean that I that I Know what someone else is dreaming ... [laughter] that would be impossible am I talking to JV\nIn that I that I Know what someone else is dream means that would be impossible am I talking to JV\nYet this is Judy\nDo you think of when you think about a horse what comes to your mind about a horse\nUm size its power\nSize and power okay and Jason what do you think about a horse\nI Would think strength endurance a very similar no\nInsurance and do you have any special memory either of you about a horse\nUm you you were more than I actually own a horse farm for a while\nUm oh my goodness I mean there's an association horse farm\n... horses at one point um I Will say that I didn't do most of the work that I wasn't the horse lover I'm but I can tell you that they were a giant a ... put a different way you were a lot of work\nAnd I sort of work and I know and so and I always thought that if they ever figured out how strong they were and how big they were we were all in trouble\n[laughter] I Love that [laughter]\nOkay so you were given a rich associations\nThat the other is a vast possibly\nIt couldn't possibly be the same that's all I really only the dream or knows what the dream is about and you cannot find out what the dream is about unless you are interviewing the dreamer and that's what I Do [noise] so there's a difference because I'm I'm not a dream interpreter climate dream analyst\nAnd I know the right questions to ask which is what I'm going to teach you guys tonight but I could tell you that when I was 'cause I used to be horseback writer and I loved them [noise] but then one day when I was about eleven\nWhoever it was looking after this adults like tying up the saddles didn't do mine up properly and so I started on the horse like a normal person should be and that's I started into cancer I started going sideways\nSideways side what if like until I was at like a Ninety degree angle so when I Dream about of course I'm going to look for some situation that's going on in my life this week\nThat I started feeling on top of literally 'cause we use language in the dream and we used ... so I started on top of something but now\nI'm not feeling like I had my ground anymore I'm like flipping off to the side so I don't feel like I'm On top of things anymore\nAnd Jason if you'd remember of course it's a discussion about some kind of work like a lot of work that you might have to do\nOr maybe you're looking maybe you're describing some kind of situation where [noise]\nAnd that's the language you use\nSo how long do you have to interview one of your clients more you store them with the dream is ... ... and then about the dreams um and how long did you how much information you need before you're comfortable you're in\nA within ten or Fifteen minutes you can get your dream absolutely if you're answering the questions honestly definitely it ten or Fifteen minutes and actually I Do um I Do private sessions\nOr that you pay for but I also do free dream analysis on YouTube and it's cold a dream in our\nAnd then I don't charge people if they're willing to come on YouTube with me and you can watch a couple of agreement or it's up there and see exactly what the conversation looks like but you have to get like some popcorn or a glass of wine because it takes about Fifteen to Seventeen minutes the films\nOf good you know you can do to you on the ... when you interview your specific questions that you know or or is it moral you understand that if someone's going to start talking about whatever it is in their lives to these issues that might be affecting your dreams are going to be on top of mind\nThey are the top of mind and the same way as we prioritize and are waking life you get up and you prioritize your day who do I have to call who do I have to email or do I have to do today\nIf you had seven thousand things happen to you today which are probably did if you include every time the phone rang every conversation you had every time you went to the Everytime you ate it adds up and when you go to sleep tonight you're unconscious mind is going to choose the one thing that's bugging me the most\nIt adds up and when you go to sleep tonight you're unconscious mind is going to choose the one thing that's bugging me the most and all of your dreams tonight are going to be you having a discussion with yourself testing out different possible solutions than reactions\nTo that specific issue\nSo\nYou're you know I'm going to let you go ahead and ask a question but I Want you to know that whenever you're ready I'm ready to go just a little deeper [laughter]\nSo when you're when you're in you you can do for you know person during so give us an example of how that would go if you were interviewing me for a dream what what what was the question do you\nSay your dream first thing that happens is me hearing that dream and writing like a maniac wall you speak\nAnd then there is no rule about which point of entry you want to use the points of injury or exactly like a puzzle you try one piece that one doesn't fit\nSome ... other piece and until you hit on the right one that makes it happen for the dream or for them to get the a ha so\nI might ask a dreamer for example how did you feel in the dream and they'll say to me I felt so scared and then I'll come outside the dream just like a dance inside and outside the dream I come outside oh what do you think is going on in your life this week that's making you feel anxious or afraid\nAnd they and we are not unfortunately we're not always in touch with our feelings so that point of entry might not work so then I'll go to another point of entry maybe all your purse and say I was running but my feet or stock and I couldn't I couldn't move right and then\nIf I hear stuff like that that's where all go in that it will be my point of entry that'll be my first puzzle piece that I'll Try will you know what do you think is going on in your life this week is there some situation you were trying to get away from and you can get away from it\nSo because you start to hear it after a while you know and sometimes it's the plot like I remember I have um four daughters that run in age from a forty five all the way down to twenty five [noise]\nAnd uh the forty two year old years ago she dreamt that she had three weeks to live\nAnd in the dream the new I'm going to go to me 'cause like climate prop unnatural problem solver and she's gonna be able to help me out and I couldn't help her and the dream she was like dying\nAnd the dream turned out to be about the fact that her exams for three weeks away and she was right there was nothing I can do to help her because she's the one that I study\nSo that's the way it goes you like look at you know 'cause she said\nThree weeks to live so for for me the point of entry was what's happening in three weeks what's going on in your life that era anticipating\nAnd that's kind of the way it goes and you want to give yourself permission to use the action that feelings to play on words and puns or sometimes the plot which is like you'll hear a person tell a story of their dream\nAnd you're listening to the story behind the story the same way we used to do an English class\nWhen you're going to ask you about some general news well you said that even if we don't remember\nIs when you're going to\nAsk you about something you said earlier as well you said that um even if we don't remember the dreams they have a therapeutic a role you know what I did we don't remember a dream and um but yet it twenty then doesn't miss the whole we getting that message\n... you're you're getting in any way that dream is providing a safe place for you to recruits [laughter] different behaviors that you may not be\nVery accustomed to [noise] and uh the dream is giving you solutions and what you do your practice certain behaviors in the night and when you get comfortable enough with them they come out in the are waking life and the point about I mean there's\nSeveral points about doing dream analysis and why it's so unbelievably\nHelpful in people's lives [laughter] I'm I'm okay where was I going with that [laughter] just just\nThe fact that um you know we we have these dreams and from what I understand we all dream every night and um I Know I Know like you know I don't remember my dream hardly at all I very rarely ... dream\nBut if you did and you understand how to how to understand the language of the metaphor you absolutely can propel your problem solving skills like here's a woman who had a puppy\nShe was so excited about this puppy that she bought and it's sitting on the table in front of her and the dream she's got it up on the table and all of a sudden a puppy ... all over the place all over all over the table\nAnd so the dream was my questions were what started off so happy in your life what where he is so excited that you got recently because that was what she said she was so excited she got a puppy [laughter] so I'm forgetting about the puppy\nBecause it's a metaphor for something and I'm saying what are you so what were you so excited about that all of a sudden has turned into a big mess and it was a job that she got that she was so excited she got that job\nAnd after she was there for about ten days she discovered that the boss is a really abusive SOB\nAnd he was like pulling all over her you know\nYou know I ... I Know the radio [laughter] for me\nI was like what would you do if you really did have a puppy on the table and it ... all over the place for what would the solution be and she said\nListen to the language by the way this is what she said to me I Would take it right off the table\nAnd when you take something off the table like in her language\nTo take something off the table it's not up for discussion yeah she said I Would take it off the table and I would clean it up and that's what she did she quit the job now I think she would have quit that job anyway ... absolutely but maybe she would've hung there for a couple of months\nAnd the dream inspired her which is very leery and ah we're Freud was looking into the past\nOffered Adler with looking more into the future and he would have said that the dream gives rise to an emotion that help the forward towards the gold and that's a great example of and Larry injury and like I said it inspired her to take this thing off the table\nYeah taking things off the table I I think we're probably all had those times All right let's let's take a break and when we come back we're going to continue our conversation was leaning about green and we'll be taking your phone call little bit later at six and a four four six eight seven seven to nine yarn justice\nDreams and we will be taking your phone calls a little bit later it's six to eight four four six eight seven seven six six nine\nYeah our guest is Laney dolphin dream analyst and we're talking about her book have a great dream you're listening to Jason GB unreality radio will be back after this\n[noise]\n\n\n[noise]\nNow did you ever look at the ... and your age ... actually ... chief\nOur swamps is the five minutes solution to get your teeth white without visiting the dentist\nThis is John Green up the c._e._o. of her swabs in your teeth are staying from coffee tea or smoking all it takes is five minutes with power swabs in five minutes you'll see an average of to shape wider cheap and in Seventy six shapes its clinically proven", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "10"}
