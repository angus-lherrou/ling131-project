empowered me and and taught me how to do it myself so\nI just you know I picked it up really quickly and I I mean the rest is history I feel very very confident\nWith with what I Do you know with the spell that I've been\nExecuting so that's how I got started it was it was more about healing and then that's when she just introduced me to it and now I feel like well I probably don't need a healer

try to win the lottery [laughter] that's not what\n... what what what good are shows that if you can't win any\nYou know I think that the power of our minds because I have discovered one thing I have discovered with magic is that in\nMy mind is more powerful\nThan I realized so I think that when we start healing on so many different levels that we will be able to tap into\nUnlimited amounts of financial abundance and spiritual abundance so I I mean maybe at some point you know maybe I Will conjure up money spell and work that but right now I've just been focused on doing the\nUm healing and

I mean nobody knows what you're going to do in that situation so I just fall and as soon as I I made that adjustment in my mind right I said I'm going to fight it felt like it just\nPeeled off of me and at that moment with my right arm I just swung\nUp when I\nWent up and I'm not kidding George I felt a hairy leg that is insane it's so crazy I didn't really tell anyone but it just like it flew away obviously that's a risky\nIt is so freaky and I didn't even tell my mom because I Know she probably wouldn't believe me but I did go back to that psychic woman was like what happened but yeah it's so freaky and I will say it never happen again after that time so I Know that this man some and that even and sent it my way but I did not sleep\nWithout the light off for about three months after that it totally terrified me who\n... who is susceptible to demonic possessions and in situations like that a child\nWell you know I'm not going to list that say the obvious ones like people doing drugs or having a cocktail\nOr drunk or shine yeah we're we're going to the ... the cemetery it you know and having a cocktail at midnight [laughter] but I Will say\nThat um there is one reason I think that\nMany other were you ever to laugh you don't have a ... which uh which should have the capital you\nKnow a which is actually a wise woman so that's the definition of a witch but yeah I think you [noise] um\nThat kind of wanted a ... that's right\n[laughter] I Can't do it even if I tried\nAnd so one of the reasons that I think is not so obvious um but I feel that can be helpful to many for them to understand I'm considering we all lived thousands of lifetimes on and I'm Glad I haven't remembered any of them\nUm some of these lifetimes we were not the best of people and um it's very possible that this is my theory and it could be wrong but\nI have proof for my showman who kind of confirmed um my you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing\nKind of confirmed um ... you know my thoughts about this um it's very possible that some of these people these victims who are experiencing what is known as karma so they can be you\nKnow harassed and molested in this lifetime\nWith the demon the danger with in in a previous life time now this is the thing I think most people don't consider the people who make packs with humans in this lifetime um the demon the pay is is usually for the life of the demon and that's usually a long time I mean I don't think I've ever heard of a demon die unless you've like slate\nJosh them all but they don't\nExactly there's thousands of them so it makes sense if you think about at Georgia it makes sense that like people make a pact with the demon that that's going to be for the life of the demon and what's going to happen when we reincarnate and the demon is going to probably harass him and molest them now that's\nOne one theory and I can say\nI'm with confirmation that it's it's it's probably very true because my sharman has a lot of cases it seems like it's more common these days\nHas a lot of cases of\nOf people who are being molested harassed and just you know that possessed by demons and what she does and she's very gifted she will take a ... journey into their past lives and and nail it\nAnd nine times out of ten these people have made tax would demons or they were maybe a big\nPowerful black which and you know I don't know it's it's it's different for each of them but for the most part they were doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing and so she does is she just breaks that agreement that they can finally be free\nAnd um I think this happens to a lot of people and I think most people for those that are listening if you find yourself in the situation and you know these demons or not bothering her neighbor it's probably a good idea to contact a qualified showman who can really just put an end to this\nWhat are these dark for she wants to ... what what do they want\nThey want our light and they want to destroy humanity duty we'd also absolutely and\nI'm sadly a lot of black magicians will cast spells against people who they feel they can steal light from and they can do this collectively with a bunch of people um and the book into us however they do it\nAnd what this does it will make their incorrect magic\nMore potent so this is why it is extremely important especially right now\nUm to to really really really really clear ourselves on a daily basis and do vanishing rituals prayers and and ... our homes and everything else because I I don't know I've been hearing more and more cases\nOf of the human intrusions into people's homes but also how the demonic forces can definitely um

I Can't prove to you but there are not evil she's up there on the other hand I have to point out\nOr you don't have to be much more advanced than we are to be capable of destroying almost everything on a ... if you put your mind to it and this isn't it amazing that we haven't done a\nCouple of thousand nuclear warheads sitting around the world and none of them have been used that's

so uh why shouldn't I be in on the ... um\nAnd I like I say restraint seems to be the word that's been uppermost than many leaders mine's recognition if I get them they'll get me in Moscow to why does\nWhy don't we hear too much about abduction cases anymore gosh you know in the seventies and sixties that's all we heard\nUs right now we I think we take it for granted that there are aliens or

everything that you're talking about you investigated what is called the Mandela a sec yeah did this is bizarre gimme gimme your definition of what that is\nWell I didn't know anything to a couple of years to a lady in Scotland and I performed a deliverance over her and she had contacted me a couple of weeks later\nAnd asked me if I knew about this the men della fact in and these changes and specific changes\nIn the king James Bible and I said no I have not and she sent this video\nAnd I thought to myself you know I'm busy I don't have time for this just sounded so ridiculous to me and I was ready to just delete that video and move on I was annoyed\nAnd I\nI felt that God just stopped me right in my tracks and just said watch this and I watched the video and I said okay I'm going to prove this wrong right now I have for King James Bible one is in my travel bag that's Twenty years old it goes everywhere that I go over the country and another one\nIs a hundred and fifty seven years old and it is in the top of my closet in my office and I pulled them all out late I'm On my desk\nAnd the first thing on the videos said that\nIsaiah eleven six have been changed now Isaiah eleven six is one of the most popular scriptures in the Bible it statues are made of it paintings of songs Elvis sang about it I it is the scripture that says on the line and she'll lay down with the lamb you remember that\nGeorge Bush and I do are classic\nFor anyone out there right now if you're listening in and if you think what I'm about to say is talk of a madman turn or go online to King James Bible dot com or Bible Gateway whatever it is and and punch up Isaiah eleven six and now it says\nThe will of the rules that\nNo longer says the lion she'll lay down with the lamb it says the ... ...\n... ... it's in writing it says the will probably never heard of that\nUh George when I saw that and I saw that in my Bible I nearly fell off of my chair I spent three years in Syria biblical studies\nI Know the scriptures and when I saw that I'm telling you right now I couldn't reconcile that I just couldn't believe what I was seeing and there it is\nAnd again I'll take my word for it if if you're out there listening or get a hold of a King James Bible or punch it up on line and you'll see for yourself\nYou if you go and look at your own Bible a hundred and fifty seven year old one yeah with bullets said the wolves\nAbsolutely and I've taken pictures of it and it's there that is what\nIt is bizarre George it's I have no ax the only explanation and I still don't understand it and I have it in the in the new book the only thing that I can take over this\nPerhaps this is linked to CERN which is the\nHadron Collider which was French board out in the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she\nIs the Large Hadron collider\nWhich was French board out\nIn the work they're doing I Believe they're opening up portals she dimensional doorways\nI mean I I remember as a kid the lion lays down with the lamb\nYeah than if you can get Tom either somebody to watch out for you and show you on screen what I'm saying and you'll see for yourself and it's shocking it's really shocking to see it because anybody\nWho is heard that scripture you know it by heart it's one of the most popular scriptures in the entire Bible and now it's a little\nCan you find it anywhere where it says the lion leads down with the lamb or is it just is it the wolf all over the place\nIt is the wolf it every Bible now however\nA friend of mine uh he has a YouTube channel ah um his name is Chris and I thank you very much for finding this for me he actually found him and his YouTube channel is a become one that could see\nHe actually found something for me out of an older encyclopedia of biblical encyclopedia and he found the passage with the lion and the ... that is the only place\nThat you will see it as something and it will be in my new book stranger than fiction\n[noise] and that's it everything else George says the wolf\nI Wonder if it's going to change if he doesn't look at it every day for example you one day it's going to change to the wolf some\nOh it wouldn't surprise me one bit and furthermore the Lord's Prayer is now change what happened was okay but the Lord's\nPrayer is our father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name like getting caught in that it will be done on earth as it is not going to have and give us this they're brought him forgive us for trust passes as we forgive those who to trust pass against us and leaders nodded to temptation the rich me will for the news that came into power and the glory forever more right you've heard that a million\nDollars okay it's changed now so now with our father which are having I never heard it like that yeah how come I Will be done in earth\nIn or near where we live in earth now you live in or is there some\nThing that changes these things\nYes and I do believe without really knowing the answer and even if I saw it in front of my face I don't know I wouldn't know what I was looking at ah but I Do believe that it is CERN and these the wave quantum computers that are working in concert\nAnd I think that it's earned that opens up the portal and sees the wave computers\nSomehow some way whether it is some way as crazy as all of this sounds I assure you it's true that they have this ability to go back whether it's going back in time and changing this\nI don't know but I can assure you of this for anyone out there who would say oh well\nThis is just the Bible's that are you know they make these changes coming off the printing presses and all that I'm Sorry I'm Talking about a hundred and fifty seven year old Bible that has changes in at a Bible that's been in my possession for years\nThat has changes in it now so that can't be resolved we'd be in human understanding we can't resolve that and another thing that I find very interesting\nIs that the Lord's Prayer I have it on paper and a frame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you ah but yeah I have Lord's Prayer is carved in ...\nFrame on my wall that was changed to what I just told you ah but yeah\nI have Lord's Prayer carved in a stone in my own and that is not changed and it has not been changed so it's interesting to note\nThat what ever this technology is apparently it cannot make changes on something that is in stone war of some type of metallic substance or something like that another bizarre think George\nOr do you have any Roman neural clocks in your home or do you have a watch with Roman numerals\n... I think I Do I think I have a couple of watches with that\nOkay well I Want you to look at the F a Roman numeral ... turned upside down ...\nWhat is what has happened to them\nThis effect has now turned them opposite so they're upside down now so where you would see a in the five o'clock position you know that would look like a a V.\nThat's now turned upside down to where it looks like an egg that's weird and again\nFor anyone who thinks that this is crazy talk just look at your watches or your clocks and and and another ... and I take your photographs of this as well and people from all over the world are noticing the ...\nAnd ... and other interesting thing I have some watches with Roman numerals that have been affected and changed yet I have a clock a Roman numeral clock\nOn my wall it might have maybe ... that have like metal ten for the Roman numerals and at ...\n... you know we're going to have our ... to pull back on our website as we get some new software and I'll be able to pull people instantly bill\nAnd I would love to pull people on the lion leaves dealt with the lamb and see how many people say that they agree that's when it was and then compare it to the statistics are yeah I've been at so overwhelming people would say that it then it was low lying lays down with the lamb\nNo question about I mean the wolf is ridiculous it doesn't fit there's no way when you say that it just it makes no sense odd\nGeorge when you look at it it just looks so odd it's not right now let me ask you this [noise] the D.

the Mandela Effect and your calls as well bill would this fall under the Mandela Effect category or the actor jak collapse\nPeople thought he had died he's dead now but during his day when he was very much alive everybody thought he was dead everybody you talk to his would that be part of the Mandela Effect\nI tell you a George I would venture to say yes I mean it's not just jak but where are the Reverend Billy Graham ah\nI tell you that George I would\nVenture to say yes I mean it's not just jak Polanski uh the Reverend Billy Graham\nAh Nelson Mandela that's how that's you know what the name came from Jim Neighbors and various other um stars like this or politicians or that or or you know people that are reverence um [noise] that somehow\nWe all had it wrong and thought these people had a five years ago and you know a lot of those folks that died in more recent years here and uh\nThere are people swear that they remember funerals for Billy Graham and televise specials and things of that nature and it's mind boggling\nAnd and [noise] really interesting that I could say is that\nThe the apple is a master of confusion and division so we're there is confusion there is division because if I say to you well George and I think it used to say this or whatever and you go no no no it's always said this now we have confusion\nAnd division is going to come in and I really believe that\nThe source of this is demonic in nature and this is Jay can't pick this in my opinion is part of the strong delusion and the great perception that has come on the earth I've had debates\nWith Bible scholars on other shows about this topic and they swear\nThat none of the scriptures have been changed it always said the wall fan all these other things that I'm an agent for the devil for saying yes and it it's mind boggling George and anybody that knows me and you know me well enough got his first in my life\nI Am an agent for God I'd go all over this country helping people to be free from demonic garbage but yet there were people die in debates against me on things like this that just said no way you know you're twisting the scriptures around and nothing could be further from the truth\nWhat did they say the devils greatest strength is making people convinced that he doesn't exist\nYes absolutely\nAnd it's uh I'll tell you this is where we really have to and and I am poor people out there here what I'm saying a now is the time\nTo really get closer to God and ask God for discernment to know what is right and what is wrong with his true it is not who is true who is not\nBecause we are in an age of deception and it is only by the power of God and the guidance of God and the protection of God that we're going to get through the things that are here and the things that are coming\nEssentially kind of scary that so many people the great majority believes in one thing and then there it is clearly in black and white something else and we swear up and down but you can't be\nYeah I it's incredible it's mind boggling it truly is and ...\nPeople are free to believe what they want it's not my job to try and twist somebody's arm into believing something but it is my job by the power of God as a man of God\nTo speak truth and when something like this comes along I Can't remain silent on it because I feel that I have an obligation to people\nThat tell the truth and as disturbing as this is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepared\nThis let's start with the bones\nAs disturbing as this is I'm Sorry it's the truth and people need to get ready and prepared for this\nLet's start with the bones Joe truck driving in Indiana they're going to start and Hey Joe go ahead\nHi George very good thank you\nThis with facts of this pre ...\n...

material world not just like movie floats there's a couple of famous ... change for ... some song lines and like scripture\nAnd stuff like that but like there's like there's a tree over close to my

it he took it I Would leave censored back\nWell when there's no there's no history of that now we don't know where that bored yet but let's just tell you what happened fast forward a few years fast forward for years and they are now Eighteen Ninety and a group of businessmen and one businesswoman\nGot together and came up with their own board version of it and they got it named and talk about this woman here her name as miss Helen Peters not for the\nAnd they consider her a gift excited and she sat at the board and the message came through and it said they asked what should we call you wish we call this tool to board this device it's\nSpelled out we job they they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it\nYou call you wish we call this tool to for this device it's spelled out we Jeff [noise]\nThey they decided let's go we just so ... so they needed to get it patented so in Eighteen Ninety they went to the U.S patent and trademark office allies are bon the attorney for this group went along with miss Helen peers they sat down at the board because they had to prove\nTo the Patton officers that this tool works everybody kept saying no I'm not going to do this no I'm not going to register is not this this is ridiculous finally the head guy came out and said okay you don't know I mean I don't know you if that thing there can spell out my name\nIs George what do you think happened it's spelled out his name sure enough in the ... came alive\nNow didn't spell out his name was somebody on the planet ... where he probably would have accused him of doing something or did it work by itself\nYou know you got to have your hands on the planet shows have led yeah you ...\nSo it started out they didn't know him and it was that you know that's how the story goes so\nThis woman miss Helen Peters not worth the uh it's really critical of crucial to the naming of the board and also to get a patent it and a lot of people didn't know about her till about six years ago when Robert merge the chairman of the board of the talking about ... dug up an old archives\nStories and letters about her and so it's we were honoring her just last month in uh Denver, Colorado and gave her beautiful gravestone with everybody everybody's and that was hard at are buried in her plot their names are on it\nUm she was just on her she was just lost to history but we resurrected her and her family was so grateful and thankful and\nAnd now she's got to be well no and she's going to go on the heritage a group of people who do tours in his grave yard it's called the Fairmont cemetery in Denver, Colorado and she's going to be remembered and recognized for her contribution to this device forever\nHow do you explain to somebody called on the show a couple of years ago and talked about\nHow to get rid of all read the board and the proper way he felt and it was to burn it and he said as she was burning it he could see little ... offered and screams she heard screams coming out of the board you believe up\nWell okay so I have the story is right and again I'm gonna I'm gonna references again we all have our stories based on our perceptions belief\nOn how we view the world her own fears our own desires and so our mind is a powerful thing it can create many things that we can't even\nTruly measure and understand and we don't fully understand awareness or consciousness and how we might even affect her worlds through creating are manifest yet\nI'm going to say that the story but what I Will comment on some board don't burn very well because it might be made out of ... a night and the worst thing to do is really burn a board I mean you could sell that on ... sent to us\nAt the ... society will take 'em and we'll refurbishing and selling it given to a loving home they really wants to protect us the history and heritage of these devices\nSharing what's the oldest board you recover crush\nWell for me and my oldest for the circuit Eighteen Ninety to Ninety three board so I got a raft they've started started being made an eight to Ninety One and production minds one year after that\nStarted how do you explain this back in St Louis when I'm doing my ... show must be Nineteen Ninety seven Ninety Ninety eight\nSomebody gets me a weed you board I've got it in my studio and I'm going to do a little bit with them and I've got a producer there\nAnd this we gee board is in the studio with me that I never had any technical issues were in the studio all of a sudden everything is going wrong what commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board window\nSo all of a sudden everything is going wrong what commercials I couldn't play him because the computer board went though the board that monitors you know my voice levels that was all screwed up the lights were going out I didn't know what was on and what was off\nIt was weird and I finally told my producer Howard into Thomas in our word get this thing on the year he took it out and within the two minutes everything pop back up working on the computer the board everything and I want this is weird anyways what I didn't know at the time was Howard\n... widow news guy named Daryl in hot word game Darryl\nLuigi board he should've done Georgia doesn't want us you try to get him so he took it as a gift I didn't know that\nAnd um you know I Do much shorter than works and I was fine uh about two days later Darryl is no longer employed at the radio station which was kind of strange what he's gone and I want for that is weird or\nA gym not knowing that he had the ... board\nI run into him about a week and a half later\nIs at a restaurant and I went Darryl how're you I'm Sorry or heard you're not one of those anymore and they weren't George nothing has gone right with me ever since Howard gave me that we'd you board I got fired I lost my relationship I Can't get a job\nI got rid of the thing and hopefully things will get better how do you explain that carry\nWell it's always all too easy to point the finger at something out there then to look at yourself you know maybe this falling down any way on a path of not doing very well working there or maybe he wanted\nWell what about the studio thing with me in the beginning\nWell I you know they want to blame that we've I buy something that you want to make it mysteriously don't want to look at something logically first it\nWas ironic that it it's very ironic\nI ... I have to give you that George but I got to say we we we ... the the the Ford because it's so controversial\nAnd it just causes all kinds of meetings and and visceral reactions in people we've really got to look at um what's really going on inside herself and what's really going on in the world around us and not just quickly jumped to say to board did it but that happens too often get it's almost easier like end is to blame for that external\nAnd to think that's the reason now now hold on as another way to think about this too\nWe create a lot of things we could just had the thought in her mind that ... is scary dangerous bad and then we can draw those things to us just for the power of our minds isn't powerful unconscious mind and then then turn around and go I told you the it's like self fulfilling prophecy\nI don't know I don't know you know all these years I've known you Karen you haven't been able to convince me yet to use the energy board\nI Know it that happens sometimes\nI mean could you be wrong could you be wrong\nAnd there's something very wrong about what aspect of it oh that it can conjure up evil spirits let's say also that\nYou can conjure anything evil in your mind and I think evil exist in the heart of humanity I hate to say that evil is then people there's evil all over the world look around at people cause evil\nBut what I say is evil is not a force outside yet we can draw these energies to withdraw other evil people too if we can have equal things happens and they are real bad evil things\nDoesn't see me just because you get a piece of wood out or cardboard or there's numbers on a piece of paper or letters that that's going to cause any problems so I I I for my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool and away from the tool I'm convinced\nThat's going to cause any problems so I I I for my world my life and what I've experienced with this tool and away from the tool I'm convinced that you cannot now but having said that people have their own beliefs and their own beliefs will still become a self fulfilling prophecy if that they truly truly choose defined\nI mean do you recommend kids play with this as a board game\nI recommend it if a child wants to you that the best thing to do if you're not going to say don't do that because they're going to want to do it and sneak what better thing to do is say hey what is it about the ... why would you want to use it what ... what do you think about it what do you like about what do you want to know\nThat I Want to go to come through for that they want they you know what they want kids like that stuff\nOf course some adults do too I mean look up populist Goshen guard colonel investigations and I think the best thing to do is say well what if it goes kept it what's that going to do for you how's your life can be and how the conversation\nI don't know where that conversation is going to go and it may go where you decide to for example I live in southern Cal you may decide to go take a child that Queen Mary and go on one of their investigation\nYou tired of being poor do it David Michaels did change your life for the better and help a lot\nTo be poor join our business team and let our ... our past independence and will be new critical Health News dot com that's critical Health News dot com Julie Leslie's below to Howard group\nOscar with my fourth interview for a director of operation ... it was overwhelming running again today and being yellow as well science isn't the job I mean and it was impressive but what really connected with me what how passionate Oscar was about something a logical as operations\nWe started to get the next town that led to process blows databases my child development when the interview became and he got ...

I got this right or got her right so I've gotten two or three right that's pretty good sixty seven point seven percent not bad\nParents website is her name with the middle initial shorts Karen a Goldman dot com and it's linked up for you don't have to worry about spelling which we can win for your coast to coast they um dot com as well\nKaren you had mentioned that the using the board\nIs so more like a permission explain that\nWell we have the ability to interact and reach into the unseen dimensions it from when we came up where we go again I definitely believe in an afterlife with it for life and in between live\nAnd so I I came into this world as a very young child scenes they're having imaginary playmate having positive experiences with them as well and I knew there was something so much more and for me the wage war became kind of my lifeline to have those connections that can tell him throughout my whole life [noise]\nUm so it becomes just that permission allows me because my allowance becomes my a gateway or becomes just the channel I use to do what I actually can do I mean I did this as a child\nThat sounds we put that stuff away as we get older and grow up and were told not to do that and not to talk to beans that aren't there imaginary playmate and go to school and I was told those things\nAnd so I found myself putting in a way that this is the one tool that worked really well for me to be able to have those communications and to this day I'm I have communications that I used to have the child but and I could do it on the board in off the board and I know it's not the board that lets me do this\nIt's my self with my ... my beliefs about the ...\nMy allowance at a village to come through and this again just becomes that kind of a door that threshold that lets me moving around and interact with them\nHow often do you use the board\nNot as much as I used to undo it a lot of work George direct channeling uh with my voice or writing off the board more often than I mean he's the board but I use the board would say about once every two weeks maybe twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it\nWe're more often than I'm using the board but I use the board would say about once every two weeks will be twice a month I might go as much as an only doing it once a month but I I prefer to work with a partner at part has a very busy travel schedule himself so we do get together we'll do a session on my last anywhere from three to five five enough hours\nHaving said that I Do a lot of ... a sessions for my YouTube channel where I Will do answer people's questions and let them have readings\nUm and I do live shows like that like I'm doing one on Halloween evening as well um so I I I really try to interact with people with the tool and when I'm not use it I'm most of time talking about writing about it or attribute of questions about it\nWhen you are in trouble with the weeds you board does anybody free go\nWell yes [laughter] yes they do ...\nYeah you know you can always hide them um and I do to help my boards I always have a traveling were with me and if I don't have one forgot one which has happened all you gotta do is get a piece of paper right the letters down put the numbers down yes and no in a way you go with a coin\nWhile the rest of the several hours gonna fly by so let's get some calls for you Karen Angie in Ohio welcome to the program I N G\nI think he's taking my call and we want to come right back\nWhen I was a teenager I had a boyfriend that he could do out of body experiences and his family was really religious and they didn't like the things you just practicing they put him in a home for a while while in me if I had a we keyboard and I had been that actually do\nHe said well if you talk to me I can leave my body and I can come visit you so one night me and my girlfriend her baby my brother and sister\nAnd after they might say that we decided to try it and it was a really calm quiet night it was warm and the windows open and we had the front door of phone you know it was early eighties we had really nothing to be afraid of ...\nAnd we're trying to talk to him next thing we know we heard a weird noise and the front door the screen door opens\nAnd there was no way could open so we jumped up and when he when the door locked it\nAnd just started shutting all the windows because we were like oh my gosh somebody tried to come in\nWell the next day he called me cause for good behavior he was allowed to make calls so he called me and he says why just shut the door on me so what are you talking about he gives you tried to talk to me last night I came by and you shut and we're on me I said that's it I get rid of the weeds\nYou look at things censored grudge\nUn gee that's a I I Love when she shared what I've learned about the border over the years is that you don't you can talk to people's higher cells you can talk to people that are still alive you can talk to animals that are alive or deceased so it's it's what it is it's really you're communicating with their consciousness your communicate with that part of themselves that exist\nLike the higher cells that exist beyond their corporate ... existence or experience and so you start having these other dimensions of a person so I don't want that doubt that you can do that as I have done that myself\nAnd that one didn't have a real bad ending to it\nYou know and I think she just\nPooped herself because it is kind of weird at first we start doing this and you go how can I talk to that person is still alive isn't\nA board to be used as a deceased person will no I've learned that this board can become your costs and the phone I I use it as a cosmic phone like I Would have wireless phone I dialed in the frequency through my intentions through my thoughts through my feelings and then I can tap into connect\nBecause I treat myself over these years to all these different themes that or is it around and for me I use it\nFeelings and then I can tap into connect cause I trained myself over these years to all these different things that are in his rounds and for me I use it for

doctor your your with all due respect I'd like to disagree with you know they just rape or you know what do you say that\nWas coming out of the board it's things that are coming out of you and you but

Debbie I'm like\nHey thank you guys so much for having me on and talk about some of the strange things going on\nOh thanks for coming on but look forward to this so you're from northern Utah no nothing strange ever happens in Utah does it\n[laughter] you know you'd be really surprised I Know that you know wherever you're from if you do some circadian digging there's there's there's stuff that goes on but there's been a lot but it happens both in my life have people that I you know being able to interview and talk to and help out\nIt's it's really kind of a strange place\nAnd you are actually started your past ... years ago in fact your childhood was kind of um influenced by some of these types of a crunch just tell us how you develop your interest in the paranormal\nSo I'm growing up I grew up in a small town in ...\nBrother who's a year younger than me and we started talking about it around that time and the experiences we were having a they included um stairs that go from the main floor up to the second floor\nThere were often somebody running up and down the stairs and nobody being there and you would catch voices are conversations going on uh\nThere were things that would go missing a and not show up again for a month or a couple of days or\nA just a lot of different strains things like that that went on\nThat really piqued my interest in my sister's interest and we tried to talk to my parents about it but they were very adamant that we don't talk about that with other people I think that well I Know that their fear of the time being from a small town\nYou're worried that people are going to start\nYou know thinking you're crazy and you know not understanding what was going on and at the time back then it it really wasn't talked about as much a openly I guess a paranormal experiences so\nYeah we had to keep it to ourselves for quite a while uh I remember how I got into investigating and actually interviewing people\nWhen I was in my teens I Would have friends over and they would actually have experiences of their own in the house just visiting\nAnd I remember one time I was upstairs and the friend of mine and I were studying for a test and all of a sudden she threw her book down and she stared at me and I stopped what I was doing and I looked at her and he said what what's the matter\nAnd she said what's going on and I was like I'm I'm not sure what you're talking about\nAnd she says in the in the thirty minutes we've been to hear something has come up and down the stairs three times but there's nobody on your stairs that's going on\nAnd you know at that time after it's happened for so long it kind of becomes background noise and I hadn't even really registered yet but I finally you know said well you know my house is hard at it and\nShe found it interesting and fascinating and before long uh when I was out with friends or party\nInevitably one of my friends would say hey John's house has haunted you got to have him tell stories about his house\nAnd so I started sharing their stories and before long people started coming to me and saying hey you know I heard that you had experience as I Want to share my experience with polio and at that point I started\nWriting them down and talking to people and collecting these experiences and as I grew up and got older it kind of grew into um even being able to help some people that would come to me and say you know I think my house was on a you know worried about this worried about that\nAnd all I got at that time was out this is how we want to do worry about but come to find out later on we'll and um it was because no matter how many times they shut that are well my mother will wake up in the middle of the night and the door would be open with uh this\nThis figure this gentleman that um we I we called them the tall man\nI'm for for any better or explanation\nBut he would be standing in the doorway staring and my parents and my mother just couldn't didn't want that anymore so all she told my dad to board up that side and hopefully that will stall and so they put a wall up on that side them but it was interesting at the time because their explanation was just how we're going up but\nTo find out but they're also seen some of the things that we had was was a good thing or to finally open up and had them open up\nWell but also I'm sure that they just didn't want to bring it up to you you kids at that time or for your issues but [noise] but when right when they were seeing these things really getting any any sort of sealing off of the negative feeling something of that nature\nYou know we never really got a negative feeling from it we never really have um I think we were lucky\nIn the fact that um it was not a negative or entity I Believe there's three ghost in the house\nAfter all of that when you sit down and everything um and nothing negative really ever happened the vast majority of it if if anything was Mr ...\nUm and nothing negative really ever happened the vast majority of it if if anything was his GPS\nUm the what we we as kids coined as the stair monster because the noises on this day and we just called the ... but he seems to have just been extremely [noise]\nHe likes to play pranks that's basically what it is and and he always has and it would be interesting because you'd go months with nothing and then a few weeks of just\nQuite a bit of stuff going on and um it happened to them to everybody in the family um and my parents still live there and there is still things going on all at the house\nSo you had a number of experiences is child in your home and at some point you said you started your talking talking to friends about their experiences people started to come to you because you you know kind of had the reputation of being the guy that lived in the haunted house\nUm but at some point you decided to take more academic look at all of this and more in a vested ... to look into this ah when did that happen for you\nSo that kinda happened I guess just through time\nOf when I Would meet with people and and also the the time between when I really understood\nBy about eight or nine ten years old that I knew something was going on in the house but I really wasn't allowed to speak outside of the home about that um I did a lot of as much research as I could as a kid on the\nParanormal um my library I remember they got those black time life books and I don't know if you remember those are not the actually by my ...\nI probably wore out although very ... about myself just by reading those over and over and over again and\nAnd anything that could possibly get my hands on and so and at the time that really wasn't much in the way of uh investigating that I was aware of um I Know that there had a little something going on but but I work now I Know that there were people in investigating at the time but\nIt it was really new to me and I was kind of\nGoing along and\nLearning along by myself all all just from my own experiences in talking to people about what was going on with them or their home and it just kind of has gone from there\nAnd then too fast for just a little bit ... more details about all this but ah you decided to write a book I mean a lot of people that's the gates paranormal not a lot of people read books about it\nRight [noise] well I gather so many stories and even even way back in the day when I first started interviewing people um I knew that I wanted to write a book\nUm I didn't know exactly how to do that way back then and so you know I had a stack of of\nOf the stories you know and um\nI I my wife came to me um we I I remarried about three years ago\nAnd she came to me and she was talking to me about that the stock that I had been on the stuff that I did and she's like you really need to just do it just write your book and so you know I went through and pick em some of my favorite sport\nOn and wrote it and it just really helped to open up even more people with ... and it's been just such a positive experience for me I'm not only for meeting people and and continue to do what I Love 'em\nBut it's it's just\nAnd not only for meeting people and and continue to do what I Love 'em but it's it's just kind of solidified the the work and the experience that I've had in into something that I can hold and it's been great\nWell in in your book you you cover everything from stories from big foot grinning man UFOs black guy and more so we're like what are some of the experiences of black guy did that you've actually heard were dealt with\n[noise] so I'm One of the first ones that I collected that's been about ... about four or five um that stories that I have that I interviewed people who have had that experience in in this\nArea and I still have about a two or three of them where I I had to get their permission and sometimes they give me the story more give me the most and yet you to publish it but\nOne of the first ones that I thought I'm this lady came to me through a friend who told her that I ate and did this and she said that she had a story and she hadn't shared very much but she wanted to you\nAnd I sat down with her\nShe explained how um she was a student at Utah State that's a here in northern Utah and she was in winter time and she wanted to go to the movies and you're supposed to go with her roommates butter roommates couldn't go she just like all on their own\nAnd she went to a late night movie and enjoy the show them as she left the theater she was walking to a car and it was cold and snowy and she noticed over a across the parking lot there is um a mall in the mouth shut down because this was around ten and eleven o'clock at night\nBut she sought to kids standing there and she thought that was really strange but we'll know she wants to her car and got in and it was I if I stop a little bit so she started it and turned on the heater and\nWould sit in trying to warm up and all of a sudden there was a knock on the window and she looked up and here's these two children um when she noticed they were in in kind of um homemade clothes she she recognized that the clothes they were in were made and that they hit their face from her a little bit\nAnd the youngest one talked to her first on a ... ... they could get a ride home and she said it was interesting because normally you know she would have\nYou know any any time let kids into a car was cold outside just something inside of her sad you know do not let these kids in the car and\nSo she even mainly excused and made some excuses but and then the older one became it very persistent and it was at that time that she saw that that they had black eyes\nAnd she she\nGot very frayed took off and drove all the way home and and woke up her roommates to cry on my shoulder and talk about it but she had never heard of black kids and even when I talk to her she didn't realize that that other people had had that experience as well\nAnd so when I explained to her that that is something that happened to other people but I at the time I wasn't aware that it happened in this area but ah it kind of was a relief to her but she was just really shift in up by the whole experience\nSomething like that will definitely shake you up we're talking with John Olson he's a tournament would vest to get\nIt's really shipping up by the whole experience\nOr something like that will definitely shake you up we're talking with John Olson he's a paranormal investigator author of a two books one called stranger bridger
