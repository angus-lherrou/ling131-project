I was only live and I didn't know English and I so people blown up I I I mean ...\nOut of Mormons I've seen everything uh curfews bombs exploding a so being at that age\nIt really changes your life so I went through the whole war the Greeks were killing ... the British told your the Turks were killing the Greeks but why do these what's going on I was a I befriended him off how the agent who told me to you know run errands for him he would send me letters\nWe she didn't allow me to open but my task was to jump from the bicycling psycho them to the conflict in the Israeli conflict any out there reason I told you the story is because I already was excited\nAbout you know the the life for fear of by yeah and\nI Love movies so to make a long story short um when I became kind of well known in Israel I met um golden Meyer who was the\nPrime minister right [noise] and she introduced\nMe to Ari Sharon you know these are all your gender roles and they they aren't sure and introduced me to the intelligence um community and they started using my abilities\nHold on right there or we're going to take a break and let's come back and pick that up right from there because you truly ruined the middle of all that with some of the leaders of Israel who stayed leaders for a long long time we'll be back in a moment with the three Geller the paranormal as The Mentalist next on coast to coast day on\nAnd George ... back with you on coast to coast along with the rebel or next hour get your watches and you're broken clocks together will do an experiment with ...\nAnd see if we can get those working for you but there are a you're talking about how you were with really the the leaders of Israel gold them my year our real shut all who ended up being the prime minister and then went into a coma and less for longer than I ever thought he would but they they they recruited you basically didn't they\nYes they introduced me to the head of a most out\nUh they recruited me and I started doing some work for them which we weren't going to but they basically didn't have the technology to test my abilities\nAnd they picked up the phone in the cold the CIA and he was a CIA scientists quote kicking green who took the coal\nBasically talks about it in a fascinating documentary called the secret line for for a gather produced by the BBC and on my website you can watch it on my website is already gathered dot com\nAnd um they asked the CIA to test me ... they wanted to know they wanted information of how the mind works how can they put the occurs\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy two I left the insurance trade to California to Palo Alto to Stanford research Institute which is today Stanford University and I went through rigorous a laboratory controlled condition test\nA and then I started working for the CIA doing you know stuff all over the place for them but just about a year ago I asked you mentioned before the CIA release that some of the documents\nUm that concerned me and it was amazing when you know the press to hold of this story any ... worldwide\nYes and die in these documents they show drawings that I've done um from you know inside parity cages are there\nThere was experiments where kids green held a book in his hand let's just remind our listeners that there were no more by phone then and no Twitter and Instagram and I basically drew worked that was in the book and he also worked on that page\nUm their word architectural and I wrote the same word in Palo Alto in California so [noise] yeah that's the answer that I worked very hard that we these agencies worldwide\nWhen you were a United States touring in a you know\nDidn't you on TV and the Johnny Carson show into were you recruited by the CIA at that time or afterwards\nIt at that time um but they need it you know kind of um ... into other areas where senator Claiborne Pell who was the head of the American Foreign Relations committee\nFlew me to Geneva we've them back for their ... uh next to me stood out Gore\nAnd I was instructed to boom barred usually vote on sort of to sign the nuclear arms reduction treaty between America and Russia of course I was briefed by by these people in London\nAnd um I go to a very close to your early vote on so I mean I was inches away from his head\nAnd I ...

very carefully because we are apt to overlook familiar things we are apt to overlook temple things if you are concerned about negative forces in your life\nThe golden rule can serve as an enormous source of protection there is an esoteric\nAnd a cult dimensions of the golden rule that we don't always appreciate\nWell that's absolutely true now why do our thoughts shape the reality of what happens\nThis is my contention in the book and I felt really had to put myself out there and come up with a theory of positive thinking I'm going to be very brief about it across all kinds of Sciences through cyclical research to quantify the arising we have made the determination over the past eighty years\nThat time is not what we think it is linear time as basically a very powerful illusion that we use\nTo organize our lives and it's a necessary illusion but if it's an illusion that means that we are selecting events all the time from across in and finish to to possibilities so I don't use the term manifest I use the term select and you can select events\nWithin exquisitely focused and the motive Lee charged thought and that's what's going on we are selecting in the same way that when you take a measurement and the particle lab you're very decision to take that measurement will affect what you experience the same is true in our life\nCan you use these powers to affect your health\nWithout question and and I have to emphasize that we live under lots of laws and forces\nOr one of them is a lot of physical declined one of them is a law mortality there's never been an exception to that\nBut one must never feel that you're without devices that year without tools\nIn the book I write about extraordinary cases of spontaneous remission of diseases which doesn't mean that is going to happen to people all the time I Would never extend false hope but the cases are there the occurrences are there and we have to probe and look at these things very often they correlate with intensive\nA meditation people who have meditative three hours a day\nHave recorded instances in the medical literature of remission of diseases not all the time but it has occurred\nYou say that when you were writing the book or something weird happened with the rock band the monkeys\nOh it was the one hand George talk about us all being loose in time a couple of summers ago I was getting into the music of the\nMonkeys just completely out of the blue and my wife thought I was going nuts my kids were memorizing\nThere I Would think you are going nuts yes you would think that no one could imagine what do they have they didn't have a few good songs they really did\nThey had some beautiful pop songs [laughter] and I was playing them all the time I was getting into them everybody thought I was going crazy I couldn't figure out why I was getting into the monkeys\nGeorge it was months and months later that I got a call from an editor at the Washington Post who said to me do you know my Nat Smith who was one of the members of the monkeys I said no\nHe said that you know Nesmith just wrote a memoir and I said no and he said did you know he was a Christian Scientists which is a a a a healing and and mentally based on a form of spirituality I said no he said well we'd like you to\nIn a a review Nesmith a memoir for the Washington Post you interested and I said of course I'm interested and I told him this story\nOf how months before without any for thought about any of this I started getting into the monkeys and I actually put this into the review and the Washington Post to its credit included this material that was just the weirdest thing that it was almost like retro causality in a way whereas if I was loose\nFrom linear time this is why I'm saying that time is not what we think it is I was completely prepared for that opportunity because for reasons that no one\nCould understand I was getting into the monkeys but the reason seem to be off in the future so to speak with my contention is it wasn't the future it's that everything is happening all around us at once which is why mental focus is so effective\nI was sixteen when the monkey started plane was there a long long time ago and if I remember one of the members was Mickey ... that's right who played circus boy on television right that's\nRight and and still touring still touring\nYeah who is still going that's absolutely nuts I Love them [laughter] and do you\nKnow the name ... gallon burger buddy chance I don't ... I wrote a couple of books one called liquid luck\nOh of course her life I Know the book and the other\nDay he he would conduct experiments they'll does in Las Vegas with groups of people ... ... each each trying to prove\nThat positive thinking in the mind has a lot to do with influencing things that happen that's Ryan and he is totally convinced and he's convinced me too that if you go into a situation whites\nSo upbeat and you know just you know positive about things the odds are really high you're going to win\nYes and you know what's so fascinating about that is\nThat outlook has been validated by Syria CSP research my hero J. B. Ryan pioneered scholarly ESP research at Duke University in the early Nineteen thirties J. B. is now deceased and one of the things that Jay be found that he just buried this in the foot notable book with its monumental\nThat when his subject in the ESP lab and these were people tested under very rigorous conditions when they had a feeling of hopeful expectancy when they were upbeat when they were enthusiastic when they were a positive their scores\nSpiked when they were bored when they were down cast when they were fatigued their scores depth and it was inevitable\nAnd spike followed mood it's the same thing that he says in the book\nIf you go into a situation any kind of situation doesn't happen to be Las Vegas down in ... you know putting that black cloud over your head for whatever reason yeah it's not going to happen for you\nIt's not going to happen and the thing that I always tell people is and again this one of these familiar things but listen very carefully to it you must really want it you must really wanted if you're a person who's attitude is neither here nor there about winning and Vegas where the lottery or money or whatever\nIt's not going to work it has to be something that you really want which is why it's so important to mix surely identify your most heartfelt desires there's real power there because the power comes from an emotionally charged thought\nWe're talking with Mitch Horwitz his latest book is called the miracle club as a matter of fact we are going to tell you how you can\nGet a membership in the miracle club a little bit later on in the program is website is his name all linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com it's amazing how well how did you decide to write this kind of a book\nYou know it was funny I had written a history of the positive mind moving a couple of years ago called one simple idea and I began to realize\nEvery chapter that I wrote every person who I talked about in the book I was using their methods I was road testing these things myself\nAnd I thought to myself look if I'm experimenting with these methods myself and if that's what's driving my historical research\nWhy don't I write about the methods why didn't I write about the steps what am I right about the techniques and it was a big step because a lot of historians are afraid to mask themselves as believers in what they write about but I've never been afraid to do that and I just really wanted\nTo share with readers the actual hands on things I Do in my own life how powerful is our human mind Mitch\nIt is powerful in ways that our generation is only coming to understand look\nWe are realizing that things work out there like placebo surgery we're realizing that people can lose weight literally George and lower their blood pressure just based on the thought that they carry with them things that we would have thought were unbelievable a generation ago are being validated in clinical experiments\nToday I think this universe is ultimately mental that doesn't\nMean we don't live under many laws enforces but if one can understand how much that means your thoughts are more powerful than anything you've been brought up to realize\nIs that the power of the brain or are we dealing with something outside of the physical body\nDealing with something outside of the physical body and I think we could say that conclusively today because we have actual experiments that the thoughts change the brain your sustained thoughts will actually alter the neural pathways the electrical pathways in your brain that's demonstrable by brain scans it's literally mind over matter so\nThe fallout has to be something that's extra physical that goes beyond the brain\nWoodward's human beings sometimes things work sometimes they don't ... if they don't work what does that mean\nYou know it's very important that that's an extremely important point because people will sometimes try 'em out that\nIt works they're thrilled they try it again it doesn't work that they feel project one of the things that I wrote about in the book is that we live within a cosmic framework where we experienced many different laws and forces belong mind is constant as a law must be but so is the law of gravity\nWhich you're going to experience gravity differently on earth\nThan you would on the moon around Jupiter doesn't mean gravity isn't there doesn't mean gravity is an operative but it's affected by math the mind is the same way circumstances\nAre going to intrude upon how we experience these things so we're ... we experiment very clearly in very carefully\nThis we're gonna come back and talk more about your work\nYour ... title and mortgage are kept on line where these foreign and domestic hack them it's simple they forge your title borrow every penny of equity you have in your home like this police officer I Know about title fraud sore register with hope\nDiscovered some these had already taken over title thank God I found out on time no bank I don't eat that program or insurance protects you

already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollars search free which sign up this whole\nTitle luck dot com home title luck dot com [noise] goes goes am\nWell come on you Stargate forty J ax and tea\n\nAnd welcome back to coast to coast George nor you whether you along with Mitch Horwitz says we talked about his latest book which is called the miracle club ... thoughts become reality will take your calls and your stories\nNext hour as well how does the S P fit into this mess you were talking about in briefly but ah I I tend to think there's a very deep rooted tie in here\nYeah oh there is without question you know we've experienced in this country about eighty years of serious\nPsychological research serious experiments that the ESP ... telepathy and George the evidence is simply overwhelming and what we're seeing in the SP lab is that the mind possesses extra physical qualities there are ways\nThat we receive and get and give information that go beyond the five census once we've come to grips with the fact that the mind is extra physical but the mind has an existence outside the sense they body it opens the door to all kinds of possibilities we realize\nWe are not just material beings and it helps confirmed to us that\nOur thoughts make a difference in the world we may be like sending and receiving stations we're always looking for people\nTo help us with projects to give us a hand to meet us halfway and as I was mentioning in the last\nSegment Jay be running the grade ESP researcher found that ESP result spike in the laboratory based on the enthusiasm of the subject so that gives you a different perspective on how important your thoughts are what actually happens to you\nMay be based on your emotions your enthusiasm your focus\nThen you believe that you can just change your entire life this way you get a better job maybe find the relationship you're looking for just about all that stuff\nI Do believe that but the here's the key thing and this is really the magic key if there is one behind all of our self help systems\nYou must wanted with everything in you you must wanted with passionate intensity and we often tell ourselves that we want things without scrutinizing and examining our convictions\nDo we really wanted for example we say we want a job when what we really want is security we say we want a new relationship when what we really want\nMaybe is is is something else you know to move to a different city or to have a different domestic arrangement or to somehow rearrange the furniture of our lives it's very important that we get down to the essentials\nOf what we really want before we put a label on it because I Would contend that what you want over time you're going to get\nDo people know what they want\nThat is really the key thing we tell ourselves well we want you know we say gee I Want a better job I Want romance I Want to live you know in this city versus that city but my urging people\nUrging people and this was something lister is can do right now is to sit down with a pen\nOr stand the sustained period of time really write down your deepest desires your deepest wants think about this dwell on this be private about this don't talk to anybody about it'd be intimate\nAnd see if they channel in one direction discover what you want to or because sometimes we repeat things to ourselves by rote and they don't represent are really passionate heartfelt desires get in touch with your desires you may think you have but I Would contend that few of us actually\nHave Mitch how close you echoed the secret that story or a different\nI ... it's different in some ways I have a lot of respect for run to burn and the secret but I rarely use the term lava traction because\nI don't believe we live under one mental super law I Believe that given the circumstances we live under we experienced many different laws and forces like the law of gravity as I was saying and the previous\nSegment so I think it's a mistake to think that our minds and our thoughts are the only game in town so to speak they are part of the game they are part of the game and that's important enough that's essential enough\nYou write about how people travel back into time to help their current life yeah but can't that also be dangerous\nYes it can and it's a very interesting prospect this is why I tell people be careful\nOf what you're thinking about be careful of what you're doing because you know we like to play games with ourselves and we'd like to say\nGee you know if I could travel back into time and give advice to my Fifteen year old self what would I say well my contention is you may be doing that all the time that may be happening all the time\nLinear time is very likely a very powerful illusion that we use to organize our lives but what we've discovered in the hard sciences as well as over the course of testimony from centuries is that\nLife is intimate everything is happening now there is in and finish the two of events occurring at once and we select among them so it could be that we are selecting among the events past president future all the time and yet these things feel very real to us very set in concrete to us\nBut I Would contend that when you think about going back and giving advice to a young herself you may actually be doing that so be careful be careful we are granted perspective we are granted some perspective but use your mind use your thoughts carefully because things that you may think of as a novelty may actually be concretely we'll\nPut it all into Apple's stock that's where they come back well well\nWho knows George you know who knows the guy who owns Apple's stock right now you know he may have just had that fought based on what you said and he's experiencing that his concrete reality whereas there might have been another reality operative in his life a few minutes ago\nMitch what is the third day mental challenge the thirty\nDay mental challenge is something that I invite everybody to join me and it's very very simple and any coast listeners who emails me I Will send them a little instruction sheet you basically right out a pledge\nThat for the next thirty days you were going to dedicate your mind to everything that as productive progressive forwarding you're not going to think of negative events of the past you're not going to think of unpleasant possibilities are the future you're going to think that every reasonable ambition\nIs within your grass you make up a grid of thirty days you do this for thirty days it's your private experiment just see what happens see what happens it sounds easy but it's not it's very difficult and if you fall off the horse you don't have to\nRestart the thirty days you just get back on the horse the ideas to just try to direct your mind in the direction of that which is positive and productive for thirty days\nSee what happens when you\nOf the possibility of experiencing a whole different life and I will do it with you I Will do it with you and if you're having a hard time you could write to me you can email me and say you know I really fell off the wagon last night and I I'm there in the trenches with you\nA couple of years ago I started the coast prayer club and you know what that is Mitch is on Fridays people will neutralize a list of people who have written in yes who are on the prayer list for whatever they need the will enrich a new job in a switch and\nSomething people even right in and said please pray for my cats you know he's sick and stuff like that anyway ... how powerful do you believe in and I will say I believe in this war since I've gotten emails back\nAfter the fact that people say you know so and so's thing was cured and this like that but how powerful the lead prayer is\nI really do believe prayers powerful and it's for this reason I don't think Mother Nature plays cruel tricks on us there are instances and there are times in life where somebody is feeling\nSo depressed than facing such difficulty that they can't do the things that I'm prescribing they can't\nDirect their mind in a positive way they are all kinds of methods and techniques I can give them but let's face it there are times in life where we feel crushed by circumstance [noise] that's one prayer comes in that's when ... comes in prayer is an escape hatch\nFrom the difficulties of our own psyche from the difficulties of life circumstances when we can do nothing else\nWe can pray and there's no wrong or right right way to pray it's an escape hatch\nFrom our own psyche so again I don't think we've been put into a cosmic framework the tricks us I think we've been given away out when we can't use our minds\nIn the way I'm describing and there are times where people are suffering from addiction from depression from grief and they can't do the things on saying there were times I Can't do the things I'm saying that's where ... comes in and I devote a

envy usually is not good but there are these persistent studies that show that whom your family is where you're born ... really do determine where you end up in life I see this all the time I get highly myself for heart fast\nCity resident and\nEven though a lot of us in the city have different backgrounds and circumstances there still good people in the city when they just can't seem to get ahead and this will lead me to my second question ah people really have a hard time just visualizing where they might end up in that I wanted to bring up the horrendous\nCar crash in skull Harry New York we're ...\nOr ... I ... I was reading some of their ... and many enough of these people were truly professional in their lives\nYou know one\nThere was evidence before the crash of something bad was about to happen I Know myself I Would have spoken up and said get me out of this debt trap but these people Mr Horwitz above\nUpper middle class the all basically we remained mom no one spoke up their their very lives\nWere coming to an end and yet you say\nA from a ... a higher exalted background that people should know but the ... they were like many people in society they they were conditioned to stay quiet and it ended up costing there ... there were twenty people killed Eighteen and the limo not one spoke up and say\nThis has got to stop pull over now and they could have but they didn't like she\nJust said they went to their deaths\nSort of wrap all of this up um ... weather me in the city and seen my fellow city residents ... many of them good enough but not getting ahead and then in school Harry these upper middle class people not speaking up for themselves\nI'd like you to tide us together and so far as why to say it if I have to like sheep so many people go to their dome and they just can't bring themselves to grab themselves by their lapels and just speak up for themselves and say gosh darn just let all of it\nAll come together and do something about it\nAnd let me let me ask you because we had the story the night in happened that was a tragedy for sure but what do you mean by to tell somebody to stop what was going on inside that limo ... uh there\nAre indications that the car was basically to use my term coming apart that they are people are saying uh amongst the victims 'cause they had cell phones that we can't we can't even hear each other next to each other or talk on the car was being coming very noisy and\nAnd literally coming apart at the scenes and you would think that intelligent people and many enough for both of you these were quite professional people would noticeably\nHigher ... middle class jobs where they should have had the smart the know how justice say I'm going to speak up here get this driver to pull over and I know because you've heard me before me keep all that driver would have pulled over no if fans who are\nNow I I Would have wanted to be in that limo would you you would have stopped that guy\n... you know ... there's a lot to unpack and what keeps saying and of course I I read that same news coverage now you know there's a new age expression there are no accidents and I break with that expression I don't I don't abide\nBy that everything happens for a reason\nRight right one of the things that are right in the book\nIs you know as I've been alluding we live under many laws enforces we experienced many laws and forces of never including love accident including accidents of birth for example now peer pressure as as Keith was alluding\nIs an extremely powerful force then it can be a destructive force one must never get caught up in peer pressure because it can be a kind of group mentality\nRegardless of whether it holds you too where you've been born or it keeps you from speaking up if you're seeing something that you think\nIs dangerous it's vitally vitally important that everybody acts with independent agency that doesn't mean you can escape accidents that doesn't mean you can escape tragedy but my contention is\nThat the mind is one vital element that participates that participates in other things that are going on and it is extremely\nImportant to exercise it at all times you're never without devices whether you're facing a crisis or based on the accident of birth and economic class I Can't tell you and I would never tell anyone that there aren't crushing forces\nSocially and economically there are but the fact is the mind is one vital tool and your belt that you can always use and it can make all the difference at a crucial moment\nIt is one thing we think of ourselves as having minds that control cognitive and motor function and that's true but there's more to it than that there's more to it that the mind is extra physical properties that doesn't mean that it necessarily determines everything and every fourth occurs or comes into her life\nBut it's one vital tool and my messages\nUse it use it always and everywhere and in every circumstance whether its environment as Keith was alluding to or whether it's a situation that you think is going to be\nHazardous never feel bound by peer pressure there is no more wanting force of your own will ineffectiveness in potency than peer pressure it must be escaped\nLet's go to Tom ...

calls as well fascinating work much and what's even greater about all this it really does work\nIt really does work you know I always tell people I Would never give somebody an exercise that I hadn't road test and treat every reader as I Would a member of my own family every single method technique exercise in this book is something that I Would give to my own kids to use it really does work\nWe briefly touched on your thoughts about people going back into time in order to help their current life how do you do that\nYou know Georgia simple as just focusing mentally on what for example you might want to tell your younger self that's something that the middle you're too as we often think of that as novelties so it's easy to picture I made the determination I read about this and the final chapter of the miracle club\nAt once I had come to feel that linear time was\nTypically an illusion and everything is happening infinitely and all at once if you can actually enter into a relax meditative state and picture of yourself into the scene going back\nGiving advice to your younger self at whatever age maybe you want to avert a tragedy or disaster maybe you want to dispense a piece of advice it can change your life right here and now in the presence but be careful because sometimes things that we as experience as challenges or tragedies\nAlso bring maturity to our life they also bring refinement to her life so you don't necessarily want to raise something that was a difficulty because that might have been a springboard to some sort of greater maturity or lesson so reflect very very carefully on what you want to tell your younger self and then imagine yourself into that\nScene imagine yourself into that scene write down what you want to tell your younger self because by writing it down you'll be able to actually have some sort of a compass point or vantage point from when you can tell whether things are different and I think you will find that things will be different\nWhy do you say that it could be dangerous to do that well\nBecause if we go back and we are race adversity ... we could be a racing something that taught us a vital are necessary lessons

to be really sure that whatever the consequence\nYou want to go back and encourage your younger self to do something healthy unimportant and productive but don't think of it as just avoiding tragedy because tragedy can actually be a springboard to maturity\nNow here's the sixty four thousand dollar question Mitch how does it or how\nDoes it work that is the question and I don't shy from that question the fact is I don't think we manifest things I think we select\nThings I think as in the particle lab\nEverything in our lives as in super position and it becomes localized only when we focus on it as if we are almost drawing up a matrix grid and when we isolate a spot or point in time on that grid we experience it as being as vividly real as my voice that you're hearing right now so\nOur actual act of life is an act of selectivity what we emotionally and mentally picture rise and focus upon is the experience\nThat we enter into because everything is happening at once and we go in and out of these things\nThe way a particle goes from a wave state and then it collapses into a localized particle state\nSelect very carefully time is infinite and our minds our sensory tools are a measuring device by which we can help decide exactly what we're going to experience\nThat's going to bury in Rock Hill South Carolina on the wild card line he barely go ahead\nHello there and your

terrific to have everybody along with me tonight is the season\nAnd you know it's kind of interesting when you are investing all this high tech gear and then it just doesn't want to work on you anyway we've got a great show lined up for you tonight um it's actually going to be the show of David [noise]\n[laughter] I don't know if that means necessarily other than that we've got to get on the program and they're both name David ... the first guess we're going to have on I'm actually very very excited about while I'm excited about both frankly but the first one on this kind of out of our normal\nUh topics of discussion but centers to Halloween season I think it's very very appropriate and we're going to have like David Howard Thornton join us in the first hour of the program he is I'm\nAn actor and ah he is best known for a movie that came out relatively recently called Tara fire it's on Netflix right now I Know that 'cause that's where I saw it\nAnd um he plays a character called art the clown I'm art the clown made its debut that character made its debut in a a movie called all Hallows eve which was a series of three short films and which are the clown I'm kind of this is the thread between the three\nAnd a but his feature film or was called Tara fire and it was a really really good fun slasher kind of movie it's not for those who are a ... into Gore and I'm not a big\nGore movie fan in fact that stuff kind of turns me off but this was tastefully done it didn't have an ... an excessive amount of Gore in it yet it had enough that made it interesting and the way it was done\nA was interesting as well so um but but uh David Howard ... portrayal of art the clown was really a the performances stole the show stole that movie\nWe're into the ... the fourth quarter of the year and we're talking about Halloween and soon it'll be Christmas and then it'll be another New Years and then I'll be saying what the heck how do we get into twenty Nineteen that's how stuff role but as a refers to Halloween\nI'm as you as most of you know any way I I'm not just the the host of your radio program here\nI'm I'm also a horror film fanatic and to the point where I created a convention a horror film convention called scare a con\nWhich is in its ninth year talk about time flying and we've got two locations we've got one coming up here at the end of the month in upstate New York near Syracuse attorneys don't just you know the other one's held in Framingham, Massachusetts in June\nBut anyway so I keep my eye on the horror film community when there are new films out and I try to catch as many as I can now I'm not one of these guys that goes to to the theater very often because first of all where I live in Cooperstown there is no theater I have trouble forty minutes to get to a movie theater plus I kinda prefer to watch these things in the comfort\nOf my home in in my comfortable chair with my uh you know comfortable smack of choice\nAnd uh you know whatever I feel like if I Want to posit I can pause it and whatever so um you know I prefer to watch these things at home so I'm kinda relegated to waiting until they're available on some type of video on demand option and\nI happened to be scanning through a those options not too long ago maybe two weeks ago and I stumbled across the film on Netflix called Tara fire\nAnd ah I'm not generally one for scary clown movies um you know I wasn't a big fan of it or there's been some others I I saw one or two along the way that kind of were interesting to me but this one just caught my eye for some reason so I watched it\nAnd uh at the end of the film um it was one of the few films where I actually thought jeeze I Wanna watch that again\nAnd the more ah the days went by after I saw Tara fire I started to think about it and in in kind of consider it\nAnd I did go back and watch it again and it was the performance of my next guest David Howard ... as art the clown that made this\nMovie so haunting me it's the kind of film that sticks with you it's it's got some Gore it's got a lot of tension um they're very few characters in the whole movie um but they're good characters but it's this portrayal of art the clown that makes it a haunting\nFilms so a David welcome to be on reality radio I'm so honored that you you uh took the time to be with us here tonight\nThanks for having me [laughter]\nYou know you're laughing now the funny thing is um before we set up this interview I didn't know if you could speak or not because in the film terrified you do not say a word\nNo one found [laughter]\nAnd that makes them rising lines a lot easier I suppose oh it's so much on your ...\nI Would just be in the chair and I liked Damian what am I doing today is like oh yeah you're straying away this girl and then you're going to stab though I'm like okay well that was that\nI you know for anybody who's seen the film they are going to know what I'm Talking about when I ask this next question but\nUm you know it takes a lot for somebody to be a good actor and ... and and it takes a lot for somebody to be a good actor when they can use dialogue to a moat it there's something there's a whole nother level of acting that comes into play when you can't use your voice and you can't use words to convey emotion\nOn screen 'em you did that phenomenally how did how did you think you put yourself in the head just needs to be able to do that\nOh gosh I mean I just basically I I have a huge like database in my brain of like silent film actors\nI grew up watching a lot of the old silent films like Keaton and chaplain and like you know Marx Brothers especially you know love horrible a lot and I'm like I Can't even think of like um art is basically like Freddie Krueger an ... an Harpo Marx had a child [laughter] and that's what would come out and start the clown\nAnd that's really into you know it's interesting you say that because I happen to be huge Marx Brothers fan myself and I was gonna ask you if ah Harpo Marx who anybody's familiar with the Marx Brothers no he doesn't speak line in any of their films and he plays everything pantomime and it was going in there was any influence there\nOh definitely I mean I I think there's a lot I mean he's got the hat he's got the orange juice you know he's a he's a lot like Harpo Harpo was always mischief maker too you know so\nIt's just like yeah [laughter] I don't know how to play the harp so so you will never see or to play the heart [laughter]\nSo what was what was it a fund soon to make was it a difficult seemed to me what was the experience like\nIt was it was it was a little bit of both I Would say more on the fun side though I mean we we had you know you're you're a little bit of setbacks you were there you know or what to happen especially with like you know low budget and the film so\nBut we had a lot of fun making this there was a lot of just you know silly shenanigans happening on set you know anytime the camera stopped growing I think you know we try to keep things light\n... fun you know the ... you know the you know a counterbalance all the crazy stuff we're actually doing on camera so [laughter]\nIt was definitely it was definitely a challenge though you know having to tackle a character that does not speak at all [laughter]\nYeah well that's going to be very very difficult and you know having to take a peek at your IMDB page and was this your first future ...\nThis was this is my first I've I've primarily done a bunch of theater and like some voiceover work I don't even have all my voice over stuff up there on a I indeed be yet but yeah it's just this is my first foray into film and\nI I loved it how did you get to rule hundred network in for you\nIt ... happened because the original actor that played um art and the original film all Hallows eve didn't want to come back he retired from acting and they had also previously cast an actor to play art when they did a teaser trailer for Tara fire\nAnd he ended up not wanting to do the role because he didn't like putting the contacts\nAnd oh so it just\nSerendipitously happened that you know I I found this this posting on line on a actors access which was a a website for actors for auditions and I at that point I was without a job or anything like that I had just come back from touring and now it's taking a few months off just you know auditioning and\nI came across as ad looking for a tall skinny guy that had clowning or physical comedy experience for the quote unquote role of a lifetime\nAnd I jumped out of it 'cause I was already familiar with the character of art anyway from all Hallows eve so I was like oh my God yes I have to play this character so\nI contacted my reps and they sent me in and the rest is history\nWhen I was going to ask you if you ... if you're familiar with the character before you took the role knowing that or to clone made his appearance in that uh I guess it was a trilogy of shorts in order to ... was the character and I haven't seen it but it was a character that kind of was the thread through the whole thing\n[noise] yes yes you are but he still wasn't even really the main character he was just like something like the fans go on down to they really liked him because he knows it's an interesting looking character is a very interesting character and stuff that he's very unique\nAnd I think because of that the fans really demanded a his own movie and so that's why they decided to make one I'm Glad that out\nBut yeah I can understand why you know I'm a ... or you generally a horror movie fan to begin with because I I Know a lot of people end up in horror films aren't\nUh where do you find the yeah I I Am I Am I was a little bit late to the game I didn't really get into horror films until like my senior high school when screen to came out I got dragged to that by a bunch of my friends and I loved it and after that I went ... especially when I went to college I my roommate chat and I would\nLike on the weekends we would go to the movie gallery and just run the whole stack of like horror films and just watch them over the weekend in just marathon those things and it was so much felt we were both the\nBoth of us are just catching up on last time so we were like where you have to [laughter] do this I actually saw him like two weeks ago at my school reunion and we're talking about that was like yeah dude you know it's because of this is kind of like where I got a lot of inspiration for like a good thing we did that back in college [laughter]\nYeah yeah that always helps um oh we're going to take a break here and just a minute I'm gonna keep you for a few minutes after the break you know and I'm going to take a few phone calls to we've got some people don't ask the question too\nUm but but you know there is one scene in the film and I think that you may have heard my intro into the discussion I'm not much of a Gore fan I mean\nYou know I I think Gore is a substitution for horror and many in many ways it's it's scary just turn off\nTo me yeah recently there are other people that swear by that is the the horror of their choice and I can understand why it might be um but this particular film had Gore I mean there's some serious war but it wasn't a you know extensive it wasn't Gore for the sake of Gore and almost to me is though you know it it it's been in the story that was being told\n'em right there is one scene a which I won't spoil it for anybody who hasn't seen it but it was ... it was\nPretty hard to watch and I'm In law just saw it in any young lady um but my point in talking about it\nIs that I Can't remember what the music was playing behind it and you know and and you're doing the sign and you've got this clown face laughter thing going on looking back at the at the other young lady who was tied up in a chair\nAnd that was to me almost the most haunting us thirty seconds of the entire film you know what I'm Talking about\nOh I Know exactly what you're talking about [laughter] tell us what was going through your mind as you were doing that\nOh I ... it was so cold in that room and I was you know I felt so sorry for a poor Catherine some more of this was just like you know let's let's get through this [laughter]\n'cause she she was in such an uncomfortable you know because they are like Ellie agrees that night that were filming and we had no heat in that room so it was freezing cold there [noise]\nThat was we actually I'm a ... I I first audition for care far back in April twenty Fifteen before they even and I think that's even before they announce that they were making it\nSo it was like ... I think they're in the process of casting or something like that when we were already filming terrified we started filming in October of twenty fifteenth so yeah\nThey just feel since they're big Hollywood studio they're able to make movies a lot faster than we were we have a minor setback so [laughter]\nRight well I I promised I wouldn't keep you very long so just a couple of more quick questions and why is the kind of addressed it already I was going to throw out the question so when do the filming on the sequel start but you guys are obviously talking about that\nYeah we're definitely talking about I'm Damian is in the process of writing it right now so I'm a ... once you finish writing it we're going to\nStart trying to shop at the studios because we we definitely want to have a much bigger budget for the sequel because you know we had such a small budget for this for care fire and we pulled off amazing things with that but\nThe ideas that we have for the sequel we need a larger budget so we're we're hoping to get you know studio backing and once we get that we want to you know I think we'll start filming\nPretty soon after that I Would hope\nWhat was the budget for the first one\nOh [laughter] I don't know if I'm allowed to say but it's probably much much lower than you think it was it was basically and fight the five figure area\nThough that's it I mean you are deemed me and the you know everybody involved that it did a tremendous job with what you had to work with and I wouldn't even have any I wouldn't I didn't watch that show I'm thinking to myself they were held back by a budget in any way I never I never saw them a little bit involved in this business so I Would uh you know that's something I I tend to say once in a while\nYes that is the true test them and they're you know the the crew and the cats that were involved with it and we all just you know put our hearts into this and you know and it's a true test my especially Damien talents on me he he I think what saved a lot of money was him doing the practical effects himself he didn't have to hire anybody else to do that\nUm would you say that the Arctic clown has the potential to climb the ladder of a horror film ... and maybe a you know stand in the plot to plateau close to maybe it on the same level but close to like the Michael Meyers of the world than the you know it's pretty ...\nYou know the ... and you know these these villains that we've we've known for Thirty years now\nI I sure hope so I mean I think he does personally I think he does because\nThose all those characters going even back to Dracula Lugosi and all those you know I'm\nCarl off all those guys that the characters they played back then and there the characters from the seventies and eighties especially all those characters were very interesting they they had charisma there was something you like watching about them and I think that you know art has a lot about him that\nPull people in as well and he's got a lot of personality and there's there's a lot more going on with them that you know you know yet as well so\nI Believe that he could I I think it's you know we're about this I Am hoping that our film is going to bring in a new age of slasher films again\nAll right I have to ... I've got to ask you this question as well because um you know throughout the entire film\nYou see are the clown you um assume he's just a clown you know obviously you need one but he's a clown but at the very end there is a bit of a twist it makes you think hey there's some supernatural something going on here is there any more natural components aren't the clown\nThere is definitely a supernatural component it that's why we put that little bit in there because even the uh if you go back and watch all Hallows eve there are some supernatural stuff that happens in there as well so you know we definitely want to go dig into more of that in the future ... [noise]\nI I look at this ... this is you know what happens at the end of terror fires the wake of who are really is\nAnd I see intro yeah so you can do is just like that that's what you're going to do\nYeah yeah we're going to build [laughter]\nIf people want to follow your work David they want to keep track of what's going on and do you have ... anything on social media or anything that you point people do\nSure I I usually just say go to like my um Instagram or a Twitter pages I'm\nA I'm under David how are you know David H Thornton ... that are different variations of that I guess I Can't remember all of them [laughter] I usually post things on there as well just to keep people updated on everything so yeah\nAwesome well you know again I really really appreciate you joining us
