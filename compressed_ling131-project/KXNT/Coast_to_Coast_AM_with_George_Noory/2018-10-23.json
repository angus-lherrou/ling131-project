sometimes when people have interaction where there isn't a need it's more people sort of like we talked about linking up to the environment and having an experience of some guys you know there's\nThat intelligent hunting that's sort of like the cream of the crop you know those types of things are harder to explain in and sometimes that falls into an earth ... spirit but I don't I don't necessarily think they hang around in the walls and kind of watch us in the way\nUm you know just like when we walk into a hunting building it's not like a zoo where we have to you know call out for that goes\nCome out and you know try to encourage them er instigate them by yelling at them\nYou know it it it doesn't to me it doesn't work like that there's so many complex processes that happen whether it's the person the environments are resonating the frequency of all the stuff we talked about earlier that just simply yelling goes to come out is not sufficient enough in my view I I think there's a lot more to go into it\nWe don't teach in Rochester New York Yankees\nI'd like to ask about possible early imprint teams on the brain that might explain to an extent why\nPeople see ghost like others and I've seen the film of the baby ... chicks being fed by humans with hand puppets made to look like the mother so wouldn't return to the wild the ships\nNoted key in on a mother conned or are you mentioned the window or who was searching for the pumpkin and his wife appeared and then goes gone I've never had any experience like that but the closest I've had over in the many years I'm now sixty three\nI Will rub my eyes in various ways all different kinds of figures\nWill appear before me a lot of figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a a Kurd would envy\nWill appear before me a figures that again bringing up imprinting I Would not think would have a a Kurd would end me a different figures in all different kinds of actions some of them quite grotesque\nAnd I'm sure that ... that goes by definition but just kind of bringing us together and closing a one about imprint teens that lake with a window we're uh seen his wife saying look uh uh in the back of the garage I Can't imprint teens\nCan people be so emotionally attached middle like a husband who was white that he would see his wife worse than the rest of us would not and maybe I in my life would be things that the rest of you would not\nMhm [noise] yeah yeah it's it\nI don't think that's a tough one to answer I I think that ... you know I it's a little bit with a widower they were talking about it's a little bit like he is resonating with something in the environment that's why he's seeing his wife he's not saying Abraham Lincoln or whoever else\nSo it specific to him there's a there's sort of a connection to him you know as as we're driving down the street in our in our cars\nOthers radio signals all around us but if I turn my radio stations in Ninety two point five I only pick up Ninety two point five\nBecause we're matching frequencies so with a husband and wife with with daughter and a mother they match frequencies and that's one of these sort of experience has happened\nAs far as an imprint goes I'm if I'm understanding that the way you're you're describing it there is I mean Carl young had this idea of collective unconscious\nSo were all born with these archetypes and the sort of a blueprint for how to really manage life\nUm so we're sort of imprinted um with with with these archetypes in with sort of ancestral beliefs that are common throughout every culture that's happening\nSo this could be me here at Ohio or you know um people in other countries we all have similar\nSort of visions and stories and things like that so I think we're all imprinted I'm In a grand gesture but it could be more specific for cultures it could be more specific for families could be imprinted I'm with certain information so you pass that down to your family\nUm so it could be more micro than macro when it comes to this collective archetypes there out there so I think there is something to the imprint I I I couldn't answer your question differently but that's sort of my best guess that it\nDoes you religion kind of changed your views about these operations ghost lean donors\n[noise] yeah I I think it's it it changes are using it basically changes our perception of an experience so you know you can have someone who's a devout religious person have the same experience as someone who is not the religious person might perceive that\nAs more of um like we talked about earlier a demon or an annual\nI'm a of of a sign from from God are assigned from a deceased person that they love\nUm whereas a person who doesn't have that religious 'til two in my experience that as simply you know an experience or or um a mundane thing or a bigger stimuli so everyone's\nEveryone's past sort of influences how we perceive any sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's why we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever\nAny sort of ... paranormal phenomenon\nUm and that's all we talked about before you know the believers are automatically going to go to whatever they believe in and if they believe in earth bound spirits everything is in our spirit a so I think perception religion uh they play a huge part how we perceive a ghostly counters impaired on the\nPhenomenon have you ever witnessed an extra ... no I never witnessed that would you like to um [noise]\nLong as it's not yours [laughter]\nYou know it somewhat although I did interview a while back and and I can't remember what I said but I've kind of like yeah I'd love to have an experience like that and then someone emails me as as careful what you wish for those types of\n... yeah exactly [laughter]\nSo I don't wish to be a part of an exercise but scientifically are worth my fascination I loved to sort of be part and sort of gain some information from that or knowledge\nI Am very curious about executions and you know how they can get this demon disappearing deem it or not the person system and you know be gone and ... it's really weird and remarkable it's the same time\n[noise] yeah yeah it it's but my brain always goes to their little there's so much misinformation and mismanagement of things like that and possibly fraud that I I'd have to be there to experience it for me to go okay yeah I Believe that\nLet's go to Shelley in North Dakota Hi Sally go ahead\nWell hi I'm a you know I mean I'm ... I'm just gonna talk about a serious car wreck when apple at my well my daughter 'cause\nYou know and she was on the lake\nJust having um last and uh she came home what's a sunburn and uh my hands when I\nCame home early from a bike rally and he had paid or twenty dollars to mow the lawn mhm and it's pretty big lawns\nAnd he said well she got her money\nYou know kind of sarcastic can and she just cry didn't I touched his son burn Bonnie nice to ... ... or she she she\nJust get it done it's gonna be okay and then I had to go to work\nAnd Pete her stepfather laid down on the couch and\n[noise] [noise] well that's the last time I saw ever then what happened she got into her car\nShe got into her car it was a corn do by which she always felt like was a big car and then her boyfriend was there and he knew\nWho was on who are in the back of his pickup and ... who was driving a car smelling she was\nShe was driving car George and she didn't wear\nA shirt\nAnd so you know these two kids were like Eighteen Nineteen years old and they were kind of had a chance\n... and they were kind of get a job\nWell then let me ask you this is Shelley are you getting visitations from her now\nHave George and a lot of ...\nNobody there\nStrange phone numbers no doubt or young caller i._d.\nRight right right do you think she's trying to communicate with you\nThank you I feel that I really feel like\nYou may be All right let's get Brandon ... take on that when we come back and just a moment brand and remember the story and let's just get your reaction to that uh because I Do think loved ones\nDuring moments of tragedy like that do try to make an effort to come back and communicate that does happen we'll be back in the moment with spinal calls from coast to coast am\nAbout twenty dollars at the time but here's the shocker today those ten thousand bitcoins are worth more than sixty million dollars and was stories like that more people are interested in owning it\nWhile I'm not going to pizza [laughter] and that's where you come in\nRight big pointed a little tricky to buying holding an IRA so we make it easy we do all the work\nKevin use bitcoin or currency\nIt can be used as a currency but right now we see it being used as an asset like gold and silver but in digital form\nHow much is bitcoin right now\nJust over sixty five hundred dollars but at one point Georgia was worth over twenty thousand that's why people on on it\nYou say you make it easy to own bitcoin in your IRA talk about that\nGeorge we do all the work we buy it for you holding insecure account and sell it for you any proceed you accumulate will be retained tax deferred until you take a distribution\nKevin you've our listeners want to learn more about the bitcoin are re what can they do\nThey can call for a free book at one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com that one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty or visit black man IRA dot com\nThanks again Kevin once again you can call for a free market one eight hundred five seven nine sixty sixty one eight hundred and five seven nine sixty sixty or visit blocked meant I R E dot com\n[noise]\n\nMan walk it back to the coast to coast your story along with Brandon ... in his book of course called the ghost studies brand new we're going to go back to selling in just a moment here\nShelly in North Dakota has the situation where her daughter died sadly in a car crash but she's getting visitation Sally how often are these visitations occurring\nShe she's not there anymore cable I get your reaction to that brand and what do you think's going on\n[noise] well that's actually becoming more and more common um and I've heard more and more stories about this the last ten years but this this idea that\nYou know this is somehow I'm ghosts are utilizing electric electrical equipment to communicate so that's like phones hacked emails these types of things\nUm you know typically people will report they'll get hang ups from um a family members number who's been deceased for whether it's five days or five years\nUm then they'll get text messages from them you know after their death or you know these types of things and there's a there's a book out there that I'm a pair psychologist Dr ... Cooper rose cause telephone calls from the dead\nWhich causes a great ... less a bunch of these um phenomenon that are happening and then there's phantom menace messages but just recently came out as well which goes over this is well\nIt's hard to really know that to me I mean listen this is the idea that um\nGhosts or consciousness or wherever you want to call ... electric ... of electrical equipment has been going on for a while so you know to to know the exact or how that's happening I'm not sure uh but anytime we talked about this and there was times say anytime there's some sort of trauma or crisis or life threatening events like she was talking about\nUm it increases the probability of these types of things happening I'm so we we the only thing we can do is try to see these consistency there's similarities and then try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nHow do you change skeptics mind Brandon ...\nAnd try to find the answers as best we can from the back and\nChange is getting smaller and you\nAre I think you could um put some some doubt and education in there about what could possibly be happening or it's it's a challenging it's challenging because you know at this point ghosts are measurable phenomenon\nAnd the paranormal is difficult to study in a sort of a logical scientific way\nThis is mainly because paranormal experiences are you know there are radical their episodic\nThey're poorly documented um their random and they're not repeatable it will which is essentially everything that the scientific method hates 'em so these things are are tough and and that's kinda why most people go into its fraud or mental illness or imaginations I'm\nNot a cop out though to be just to see the\nAh I think it's an ... yeah a cop out would be an easy answer to it so that's the idea is if it's ... if I'm presented with something that I don't know the answer to um rather than spend hours and hours of researching it I can just say the person's misunderstanding or it's fried or over active imagination\nAnd then I could go on living my life in my normal views and it doesn't blow my mind at any kind of way\nSo it's an easy way to sort of give an answer to something that you know which is pretty mind blowing phenomenon um but you know there's all this this stuff out there that that some people point to as evidence like pictures a BP's\nUm but there's really no fall up after that um and then those things nowadays are easily fake\nI I think really if and this is kind of what I tell people out in the paranormal investigator is is you got of it's about collecting data it's about sample sizes it's about being consistent and what you do and that was over how you that's how you progress or advance of field\nYou know similar questionnaires at all these people are using when they do investigations similar methods\nUm you know if sample sizes huge in academia in which skeptics as well is that you know if if you have a sample size of three hundred people that's pretty impressive if you give questionnaires if every paranormal team gave a questionnaire to somebody and they did a hundred investigations a year and there's\nYou know I don't know three hundred paranormal teams out there your sample sizes getting pretty big and\nThen academia takes notice because you have a hundred thousand questionnaires that are just waiting to be analyzed and then you start getting some variable or um some similarities inconsistencies and then you have a measurable phenomenon\nSo you know it's it's hard to argue with someone who has a close mine but if you could just push him towards a piece of research or a book or something like that and maybe they pick it up then that helps\nYou know and that goes for the opposite end to what people were just adamant believers there's there's things you can push a more towards the middle with which is to me is the best place to be\nLet's go to Tom truck driving in Pennsylvania Hi Tom going\nBy [noise] how are you ready Tom thank you yeah I Want to talk to you guys I'm a longtime listener first time caller so bear with me a little bit short story\nA back in Nineteen Seventy

nuclear engineering as well noted author one of his books\nHow to live on Mars and we're going to talk about all things space and the next couple of hours Robert\nWelcome back my burned thanks for inviting me always a pleasure hobby Ben I'm pretty good pretty good keeping busy when we go in the march [noise] um\nAt this point it looks like we're going to go to Mars when I'm either ... or one of us ... and we're one of its competitors takes a fair um space X is pushing hard a following up their success with the Falcon Heavy launch vehicle with a developing their beer far\nRocket which will be a fully reusable or to stage to orbit hundred and fifty tons to earth orbit vehicle that's equivalent to a Saturn five but fully be usable or that will give us the capability to go to Mars uh\nAnd if they should um you know ... off the edge of the ice because you know you must quakes to skate next to the edge of the ice you know I'm\nThere and got a blue origin company by a led by ... the owner of Amazon is a is coming up on his heels so ah we've got a new space race going on and I think that one of these outfits is going to get us to Mars right now\nYou know NASA is does great work with its robotic planetary missions and its space astronomy missions uh ... their work in that field is ethic but uh the human spaceflight program is dysfunctional uh they claim they want to go to the moon but they're not even planning a reasonable plan to do that\nAnd um so I think it's gonna be one of the new kids on the block that gets us there\nAre you happy the privatization is taking off the way it is and that NASA is kind of like feeding away\nI'm happy that privatization is taking off I Am not happy that NASA is a human spaceflight program is dysfunctional ah I'm not happy about that at all um the uh you know I ... it would be a disaster is NASA's robotic\nSpace flight program and space astronomy programs became is dysfunctional as the human spaceflight program but\nI mean it's really sad to see this program that I mean that storm have it in the Nineteen sixties doing this crazy stuff now where you know they say they want to go to the moon and I was at a conference in Florida a month ago were high level NASA official that actually got up in front of an aerospace audience and said\nWe're not ready to land on the moon we don't know how to land on\nThem [laughter]\nWhat what happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember back to die\nWhat happened in Nineteen sixty nine [laughter]\nYeah you you you got ... maybe they're waiting for all the people that can remember back to die off so they can tell people they did it the first time\nIn that statement alone Robert will make all the people who do that we went to the moon jumping for joy and say see I told you so\nWell I got to tell you guys like him didn't take us to the mood um and I mean here's the thing you know they're saying before we go to the land on the moon we need to build a space station orbit around the ... which is totally crazy\nIt's totally crazy and it's it and they want to put it in this weird orbit which is going to be hard to get to and hard to get to the moon from it and hard to get back to it from the moon it's going to add propulsion requirement is going to add timing requirements to any lunar mission I mean ... let me tell you what this they call this the deep space gateway\nYeah OK and let me tell you what I call it the lunar orbit toll booth okay [laughter]\nThe the the ... here's an analogy let me say I offered you the following deal I Want to read you an office in\nSaskatoon now you're gonna have to pay to build the building and you're going to have to pay a hundred thousand dollars a month rent and it's a thirty year lease you can't get out of it and you must go there and stay there at least one month a year and if you want to fly anywhere from your home you have to pass through Saskatoon to go there\nI pass a bill to pass on that had the ... and this thing\nIs that I buy the ... and you'd probably sell me what you buy the swamp lend you probably want to sell me\nA lot better off with the swamp land than with this ... ...\nYou know with measles doing what he's doing falcon next base acts are it's a good thing you're right it's just you know for someone like you and\nAnd me the way we grew up during the space program watching NASA just kind of not do much anymore with manned space flights in and say it's disappointing Robert really is\nWell it is and I mean look you know our parents' generation one World War two they had a government that was functional and that government built the interstate highway system and that government got us to the moon\nAh and and now we we see this thing is just dysfunctional it's incredible\nUm I mean it's not all NASA I mean this is across the board we had a a major deterioration in the quality the political class in terms of its ability to execute great projects on it and act on the basis of public spirit instead of partisan\nA chaos and the the the you know so there it is but uh I gotta tell ya you know\nI was hoping that the new NASA Administrator who was delayed and getting into office for quite a while\nWould come in and say I'm not buying this crazy lunar orbit space station this is you know what what the incompetence who preceded us uh you know want it to do I'm going to straighten this out we can certainly land on the mood I was hoping Bryan it's time would do that but he didn't he just went along\nAnd I'm just shocked frankly\nA couple of weeks ago when I was in Los Angeles I had a chance through a witness the flight of one of the falcons\nA at night to another team back it was a reusable and it was just gorgeous Robert watching that and half the people who are looking into the guys that night uh the they didn't know what it was so he thought it was a UFO or something like that but it was spectacular to watch it's incredible technology isn't it\nIt is a although I mean one might say it's about time\nWatch it's incredible technology isn't it\nWell it is a although I mean one might say it's about time ah\nBecause sure we started the space age with expendable rockets and you'd figure that fifty years later we finally get him to be reusable so I'm Better late than never and and here it is and\nAnd I got to tell you this thing that mosque is done in creating these reusable rockets and and and and and he's reduced the cost of space launched by a factor of five it was ten thousand dollars a kilogram perform us now it's two thousand dollars a kilogram\nDramatic it's dramatic it's protect killer and it was done on a shoestring compared to um what a\nNASA considers normal for developing new space systems I mean it was done like from one tenth of money in one third of the time that any one of ... was accepting would be normal\nAnd this thing um the results has been not only a these remarkable space systems that space Texas fielding\nIt is causing a private money to get into space and a number of other advanced fields that people thought were hopeless\nUh so okay Bezos has his own money Scott large and but we now have three small launch companies a firefly a vector space\nUm electron a these are small launch vehicle companies that have all gotten you know investments on the order of Seventy million hundred million dollars\nA two to field a small launch systems and it even goes beyond the the us space industry\nWe now have you shouldn't power startups getting funded because people you know they were looking at future parents all this is just never going to happen they keep on saying it's going to happen in Twenty years and now it's been Twenty years and I think another Twenty years and but people than say maybe\nIt's not really an impossible technical problem maybe the problem with it and um\nI gotta tell ya I actually worked in the fusion program in the Nineteen eighties and I can remember one lunch we had at Los Alamos when the group leader looked around the table and he said to all of us\nYou know when fusion powers finally developed it's not going to be at a place like Los Alamos sport Livermore it's gonna be a crackpot working in his garage yup well maybe not a crock pot in his garage but I think probably start up working in a warehouse is going to do it\nAnd he's going to get funded and God Knows what is going to be able to do with the Robert stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about space next hour we'll take phone calls with you Robert Zubrin our special guest tonight for a couple of hours next on coast to coast\nAnd welcome back with Robert Zubrin from the bar society as we talk about space we'll take calls with Robert next hour Robert de you know ... don't you what kind of a guy is\nWell um [noise] [noise]\nWhat can I say he's an unusual guy um do you like him he ah yeah\nAlthough we can be a difficult at times I mean he has a sense of humor it's kind of dry and uh he he is\nUm [noise]\nUh okay look um\nThe thing to know about Iran is is this okay on the one side he well he he is very driven it's very hard working uh uh and he is\nA driven to want to do\nSomething great for the human future he wants to be a person for the ages he likes money\nHe likes cool things he can buy with money but that's not what he's about uh\nNow he he he really wants to do he he wants to go down in the history books for doing something great for for human kind and and so that's the other side of it okay is that\nHe doesn't just want to do great deeds he wants eternal gory for doing great deep so he's not Mother Teresa can be selfish and he\nHe um and he certainly um\nNot above using people ah and you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well like Kim getting angry\nAnd you know if you look at some of the things about him that um didn't come off so well why keep getting angry that he couldn't be the one that rescued those kids in Thailand um that that's the other side of it so you're a ... you know there is\nUm\n... you know a self assigned to it but it's not selfish for money it's it's it's it's a selfish for eternal glory for doing great teaches you go about that\nIt's not exactly go it's it's you know if you read Greek mythology like the ... had this is what homers heroes are about they are about eternal glory for doing great deeds or Shakespeare's Henry the fifth you know uh\nWhen he gives that speech you know we few we happy few we band of brothers he he wouldn't want anyone else there with him at action core to to fight the French because he he even though it means the odds are more against him he doesn't want to share the glory with anyone\nSo you know that's mosque to AT T and um and and and so\nBut really um [noise] you know that that's the\nClassical motive of the hero okay so I I think must be a hero not a hero in the sense of being a perfect person but a hero in the sense of being the kind of person\nI'm a ...\nThat is depicted as a hero in literature a that is a person who wants to win eternal Gloria Knight errant who\nGoes out uh looking to slay dragons looking to do something terrific uh ... that's what he's about but you know um\nHow would you can just results Robert Well Jeff Bezos is much calmer I'm much more laid back\nUm I don't know these cells I met him once uh uh but that was certainly my impression uh and if you look at how the two companies are run a they reflect that a mosque is extremely driven he wants to stun fast\nOr he wants everything done yesterday and um\nThe company takes chances and thus far um they're winning um blood is certainly a there they pushed very hard bees owes the model of his company is step by step ferociously he's not in a rush measles strength\nAnd his weakness is that he has unlimited funds\nNow why it is limited funds that sounds like a strengths doesn't it [noise] um well in one sense it's obviously is up but the and the other sense it isn't because if you have unlimited funds you have unlimited time and that's why at\nThis point space sacks is racing ahead of him so this is the you know ... the hair um blue origins the tortoise and ah it'll be interesting to see who wins this race you know measles is at least ten times as rich as mosque\nOkay so I mean must you know by the standards of you and me and almost anybody um is a very rich person he's the Ninety fourth richest person in the world according to Forbes\nAnd is he doing all this with his own money or is he getting financing what's he doing\nNo mosque or is it well he started out doing it with his own money right now it's partially his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA effort the military being so just doing it all with his own money\nOur ... his own money but he's also won a lot of contracts for launching things for NASA for the military\nBeing so just doing it all with his own money okay these shows you know is the richest man in the world ah and he you know he says I can just take a billion dollars worth of Amazon's stock each year sell it off I got a billion dollars I'll spend it on blue origin\nSo he he has unlimited funds and he thinks he has unlimited time\nI'm mosque knows that I'm you know in aerospace a cost just people times time\nUh the quicker you just do something the cheaper costs people say things like oh if we uh uh uh uh try to do Mars you know within ten years it would cost much more no cost much less\nUh because uh you know a space program is like riding in a taxi cab and it costs you whether it's standing still or whether it's moving\nYeah that is true let's talk about our mutual favorite subject in that's Mars what what's going on with some of these latest discoveries underground lakes and things like that Robert\nOh yeah well it's pretty spectacular okay the European bought all these experiments or ex discoveries\nBy the way are being made now with a\nUm something it's not exactly new but is is is finally really showing its its stuff which is a ground penetrating radar than his radar that can look through the ground and see what's on the ground\nAnd um the ground penetrating radar on the European Mars Express pro found an underground lake on Mars it's salt water\nUh and um but it's definitely from the point of view of microbial life a habitable environment um it's been suspected by a lot of scientists and by me um that uh there was a liquid water underground on Mars it has now been found\nAnd I believe that we're going to find a lot more because there's no reason why this Lakewood just exist in one place I think there's an underground water table on Mars uh and um you know on earth\nSome of the earliest organisms that ever lived on earth are still living deep underground in the ground water the surface of the earth has changed radically it's no longer habitable for them but the groundwater\nIs is as it was billions of years ago and they've been down there and if there was ever life on the surface of Mars it would have retreated into the groundwater and it'd be they're still\nNow then beyond that the ground penetrating radar on the American Mars Reconnaissance orbiter\nHas found glaciers on Mars at mid latitudes that is I'm a mountains of pure water ice and something like\nA a million cubic kilometers\nOf pure ice covered by just a few feet of dust knows it's right there and it's a mid latitudes that is it's as far south is thirty eight ... a a north in the northern hemisphere of Mars which by the way the same latitude a San Francisco\nSo imagine that there were glaciers in San Francisco and Denver and you know a\nDC you know that's the latitude that these things are and what it means is that there's water readily available on Mars and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get\nOurs and not just you know I'm half a kilometer or a kilometer underground like this lake is but right at the surface where you could get on with a shovel\nThat's exciting you know some people this is strange some people say that if there's life on Mars or even the possibility that we shouldn't even go there that's that's weird why\nWell that's a pretty crazy point of view um I think there's there's\nTwo they there there's two different versions of it one is the scientist saying if you go to Mars um then if we find life there we won't know whether we brought it or not okay\nContamination\nYeah well that's like saying if you go to France you won't know if the people there are French or not I mean that that that because they might have all gotten off the plane with you I mean look if if if\nHow do we know that there's actually people in France and they didn't all just show up when you did well for one thing there are houses and there's the arc de Triomphe and there's the Eiffel Tower there's all this stuff that they built in the past well if there's life on Mars today it was there in the past and there will be fossils of
