happening in the middle east we have to special guest for you let me introduce them first Fred Burton front is the vice president of intelligence and counterterrorism at the Stratford that leading geo political intelligence for him and he's one of the world's foremost experts on security\nTerrorists in terrorist organizations easy former State Department to counterterrorism deputy chief DSS agents and the author of a best selling memoir ghost confessions of a counter terrorism agent and chasing shadows here's Fred first of all Fred welcome to the program looking forward\nTo this thank you for having me on again George ... spent about seven years since you were last on with us but I'm Glad you're back Samuel Katz\nIs a New York times best selling author and an internationally recognized terrorism law enforcement in military special operations expert is written more than twenty bucks in hundreds of articles in the Arab Israeli conflict\nInternational counterterrorism military and law enforcement special ops and Palestinian and Islamic fundamentalists tour as well Samuel welcome to to the program\nThank you so much for having me and their book is called Beirut rules the murder of a CIA station chief in his bowl as war against America a friend and Sam ... of the Lebanese a heritage and I'm very familiar with that\nTore blown the country now be we're used to be the jewel of the middle east isn't anymore Fred isn't\n[noise] no I'm afraid not a George ah we've watched it deteriorate for several years now and of course a Hezbollah has become a very strong in country and a operates as an Iranian proxy\nAnd uh how long Samuel has this been going on with the rent backing Hezbollah and who are the are these Lebanese people or the Iranians who are they\nWell Hezbollah the Lebanese party of God it is a Shiite religious militia\nUm\nUnderground Iranian proxy group that was of formulating around the time of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in Nineteen eighty two\nUm Lebanon as as you know of always split between the Sunni the Christian and the Shiite populations for domination of the country and the Shiite were always relegated to third class status\nAnd in Nineteen Seventy eight one of the Shiite spiritual leader of 'em was murdered in Libya and left the vacuum in the country and and that coincided with the onset of\nAyatollah Khomeini and Iran and the Iranian Revolution and they and the Iranians for a possible fertile ground to spread the revolution in Lebanon and they said and if there is that they send 'em intelligence specialist Samantha revolutionary guards and\nTo live and on with theory of blessing and they set of faith in Lebanon and they establish amongst the many state within in many states that was very obvious to many inside the country for them I interviewed a few people\nWho are journalists at the time in Lebanon and they said that the Iranian influence was everywhere um sadly the the two people of the two groups that neglected this\nThe Iranian influence was everywhere um sadly the the two people of the two groups that neglected is this a rifle and the amount of money and the amount of influence with uranium through spreading it a little bit on\nWhere the Israelis and the Americans to people that have a vested interest in keeping 'em the Iranians way out of Lebanon\nFor ed is Hezbollah as dangerous or more so than what we have known as al ...\n[noise] well George I think that's a relative or statement uh before uh Osama bin Laden came along a Hezbollah certainly had a more American and Israeli blood on their hands than\nThan any other group I Know from that time period from investigating the attacks on\nThe u._s. embassies and the hijackings and the assassinations and and certainly the kidnapping of the CIA station chief which uh Georgia when you look at this from an intelligence perspective and you look back on the on the course of a kind of just some history a\nThis had never been done this was an organization that had\nA literally a snatched or the United states of America is number one intelligence officer assigned to the country to rebuild\nA all the intelligence operations after the uh first a U.S embassy bombing uh so uh this was unprecedented its time and um it was certainly shocking for us or that it occurred\nUh but I'm also a a great sense of failure on our part to because uh I Know when we were looking for Bill Bill Buckley\nUh we we just simply did not have the human intelligence to be able to tell us exactly where he was so\nUm it was one of those tragic moments in in the course of a of history that are certainly a um I'll never forget and uh but I Know that there was a heck of a heck of a lot of us that that certainly tried to find bill who certainly was an American hero\nAnd you get into that story or wanted to get your reaction to a jak Anderson article that ran in Nineteen eighty students Wilfrid heard what what do we say to Americans who simply say look this is in the middle east it's not here in the United states why do I have to worry about this what do you tell them\n[noise] Georgia and it's a fair question uh you can only look back on the events of ah nine eleven and the planes flying into the twin towers and\nThe plane that went down in Shanksville, Pennsylvania and certainly that hit the Pentagon or as an example of we have to be cognizant of the geopolitics of the region or why we need a footprint uh in the area why we need to take the fight to the enemy\nOr and or or take out these individuals are so they don't carry out attacks on us soil\nAnd uh that's the the critical geopolitical reason why we're doing this\nOr we're going to talk about William Buckley you're just a moment we're with red Burton Samuel Katz the book is called Babe Ruth rules next hour we'll take phone calls with them on what truly is\nA very important story that's been going on that is not to a well publicized in hopefully Fred than Sam you're with your book be rules you get more and more exposure\nTo what's happening over there in the if you can say I'm In a couple of minutes we have before the break give us an update before we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of has the um the\nBefore we get into the book and William Buckley after the break give us an update of what's happening in Syria today\nWell speaking of Hezbollah um the Hezbollah forces had been fighting from the onset alongside rainy and special forces to help keep 'em president off of um regime in power has ... has been transformed from an underground fourth\nI'm In the Nineteen eighties um the period we're afraid and I wrote about William Buckley in the early emergence of um the fundamentalists suicide Shiite brand of terrorism and it has emerged into probably one of the stronger almost conventional armies in the middle east\nUm it is for the United states and Iraq it was um it was absolutely in a central player in helping the Shiite militias in Iraq developed there um I ... I'm strategies and tactics that killed so many American servicemen in two thousand ... launched\nA um horrific war against Israel where I'm laid siege movie of indiscriminate rocket fire against Israel cities um it is involved the narco terrorism it as one of the world's largest cocaine and I'm I'm traffickers in the world and it is a force to be reckoned with\nThat we cannot ignore 'em specifically because it has it we ... them operatives in this country\nHe's has for many years and it is an arm in and extension of Iran was um a desire to be a regional player if not regional superpower in the middle east region of the world that is um ultra important to us national interest\nAll countries of course work through struck parties we worked with will Selma bin Laden and the mujahideen in Afghanistan to get the Soviets out of there giving them cash and arms and everything else so I can understand why the Iranians are doing this with Hezbollah\nBut why are we getting top with Iran over this why are we talking about sanctions why don't we just say enough stopped feeding these people stopped supplying them we're gonna win ... why don't we do that Sam\nI think that this country has been very apprehensive\nAbout engaging Iran militarily since\nOur hostages were seized the U.S embassy in Tehran I'm a many many years ago I think there were numerous um declarations of war by Iran and Hezbollah against the United states the bombing of the U.S embassy bombing of a second and to see the bombing of the marine barracks which\nWas um on the thirty five years ago to this day\nI thought we were looking for a ... operation that we were really looking for an on air\nStart hiring with Lincoln jobs today go to link dot com slash working against fifty dollars off your first

Burton with us Samuel Katz their book is called be rude rules\nSam you were mentioning of course that the Hezbollah may have sleeper cells in the United states is that possibly one reason we haven't gone after Iran militarily and attack them because we're afraid that those cells could be activated no I don't\nThink so I think um we haven't gone after you were on militarily because we're not really sure what a direct military conflict with Iran might bring I think the reigning you of groups like Hezbollah to export terrorism throughout the middle east\nAnd the rest of the world is daunting and the four um policy planners in this country for generations it was um directly responsible for a lack of response to suicide truck bombings against and the fees Murray and ...\nAnd the kidnapping of a CIA station chief from things that was unheard of in the world of espionage up until that point and ever since I'm William Buckley was the only station is she from the CIA that was ever kidnapped and murdered in the history of agency\nFred Burton tell us about William Buckley a bill was a a a true patriot George uh he uh grow up in a stone um Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just\nA a true patriot George uh he uh [noise] grow up in a stone I'm a Massachusetts\nAnd by the way for people just listening to this is not the journalists were talking about\nIt's not there's actually a funny Side Story to that because the other William F Buckley was also associated with the CIA\nAnd our William F Buckley actually received a few of his paychecks over the years I wrote them and uh our bill thought it was pretty funny and a thought about a cashing them but I'm a\nBill grow up in the Boston area a salmon I were lucky enough to uh get the cooperation of bills or family has a elderly companion or that he lived with for many many years and a sister who just told us wonderful stories about a bill growing up uh [noise]\nUm and he went off after high school into the U.S army and enlisted and went to Korea\nAs a young kid and um where he was a silver star recipient and are\nAlso a Purple Heart I'm an which was an amazing kind of a research task or we uncovered with the first calvary division where bill first enlisted into now than it comes back on the GI Bill goes to Boston University\nUm graduates gets a hooked up with the CIA or in the early fifties it was very murky\nA as to exactly what he was doing at that time period and we cannot find a anybody that could tell us specifically what he was up to a but regardless I'm a he leaves the CIA and becomes a librarian of all things when you know didn't surprise me because of\nAh the nature of it as a curiosity and his language is and you know ability to\nTo just I'm a study history and specially military history uh so uh in Nineteen sixty or he joins or the U.S army again a and goes under special forces\nAre and I'm also a associated with the CIA and that time period or he was recruited by this mysterious figure by the name of girl\nUm who was in the Boston area who was a CIA spotter in recruiter and um little goes off or\nTo Vietnam and where he is also a again awarded the silver star or for courage under fire a so this was a man George that was always running towards danger and\nUh he he reminds me of the NYPD a cops and firefighters running towards the twin towers on\nYour show no fear they just did what they had to do\nIt exactly and um and and off the bill uh was uh\nUh the only guy to raise his hand to volunteer to go to the root uh at the CIA or after this devastating embassy bombing in Nineteen eighty three where the entire CIA station is wiped out so [noise] um that was who Bill Buckley was a you know he was a true American Hero\nNow was his assignments bread in Beirut clandestine or was it pretty well known by people\nWell ah the station chief uh um is usually declared towards the government meaning ah the the local Lebanese the liaison intelligence service knows exactly who he is a although he does have a diplomatic passport or he's known as the uh the CIA officer the cheapest station\nAnd of course the other ... intelligence liaison services know that to such as the Jordanians the French the Israel was and so forth so I'm Bill is not a in a undercover position during the\nAnd it's such as the Jordanians the French the Israel was and so forth so I'm Bill is not a and a undercover position during that time period\nSomebody read it on him you know do well\nUh it was very difficult to operate in Beirut in that time period um it you know in order to do your job you have to get out and about meat sources meat snitches uh and so forth and so uh you know bill was that kind of person\nAnd I'm In essence a leaving his apartment one day a in Nineteen eighty four you know he's he's kidnapped these overwhelmed by a multiple vehicles are and Hezbollah grab them and um they're begins is a time in captivity\nWhy didn't you have security around [noise] it's a good question or I can tell you a first\nHand from that time period it was an unusual for station chiefs and not to have security uh salmon I did our last book on bin ... uh where you had a whole Qadri a professional uh security personnel to specifically watch a CIA officers backs\nAre in that time period are they really didn't exist you could request security you could get a you know folks coming over to to help or maybe some assistance from the military at times but\nUh you can't really do your job is a is a secret agent to use that phrase it with an entourage so ah the nature of the job in that in that time period was a you're a single time you were kind of like a a Lone Ranger you're out on your own\nHe was held captive for what about Nineteen months before they finally kill him\nHe was kidnapped on march sixteenth Nineteen eighty four and um I was part of the hostage de briefing team where uh we were assigned to at the CIA to hunt for Bill Buckley specifically as well as the other hostages\nAnd uh we did not know bill had died um until father Martin Django came out to who was a wonderful man I spoke to him and ... and these button Germany after he had been held in captivity and and he told his bill had died\nAnd that bill had been tortured and bill was very sick\nAnd it was one of those moments George I'm In life where um we we knew that we it failed bill and it was like the weight of the world came upon us because\nUm we had devoted this entire operation to find him and we just couldn't find him so [noise] uh then it became a recovery mission you know let's try to find the body and go from there\nWill must have been like looking for a needle in the haystack for it oh\nMy goodness George I can't tell you how how difficult it was a time period um you know we had a we didn't have a lot of human assets on the ground then\nUm we we didn't have a lot of collateral intelligence of course the Israelis tried to help and and other intelligence services but um it it was it was very difficult it was trying to find a a person in a building or in a very barracks\nUm and we literally that could not put him in a in a neighborhood a at times so are we just had these huge or intelligence gaps and it was extraordinarily frustrating [noise] uh I tell you one of the fascinating things that salmon I turned up in the story a George was\nA at one point or the FBI believed that uh through through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran a and another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy\nIt was through their source network that bill had actually been flown to Tehran or in another time actually held inside the Iranian embassy in Beirut\nWhoa I'm which I'm not you certainly\nA smoking gun or as to who was directly behind a you know the kidnapping\nAnd Sam ... let me ask you this back in Nineteen eighty eight columnist at the time jak Anderson wrote an article about William Buckley simply saying\nHe was tortured to death and he gave up secrets or you know and I'm not up to slap the man's name by any means but where do you think do jak Anderson's column accurate or not\nI I think it's I'm fairly safe to assume

New Jersey we have an area in the Oklahoma Panhandle\nNew Mexico Colorado Kansas that's not Indian land it's a national grasslands Scott water and it's sparsely populated people the money that we support\nFor Israel now\nCould be used in relocating them if\nIf we wanted peace and all that kind of thing they could have a new Israel\nI ... I got to tell you though Dennis\nIf we wanted peace and all that kind of thing and they could have a new Israel\nWhile I got to tell you the dentist is not just having property it's where it is a in this course the Palestinians and the Israelis are truly one where they are because it's the holy land it's it's where\nJesus and everything else began for them and they don't want to move to Kansas City or Iowa or Nebraska or anything like that we've got the land available there's no doubt about that but it's not just about land a part of the issue is fighting over the holy land itself sham I Want you to take that question\nUm there's land but if not their land and I'm I'm\nI I think trying to federal um where people go at this point\nIs a ... that's not going to happen or if it's way way too late I'm if I'm Wondering if you should ever had um you know the the second burrito I'm forty years after you've had the fifteenth slice of pizza I I I think what's important to understand that the Arab Israeli conflict\nIs that the experts the state department diplomats\nAnd everyone has been using a formula vast um you know it'll that the Israelis and the Palestinians\nCan be an end to go see a lot of these like everyone else and they're missing what I Believe is a critical point and that is that the mathematical equation that they're working on is flawed\nThe state of Israel was um was created the Israeli DNA dictates that the Jews never again be forced to um to do anything at the point of a gun I'm through force\nAnd the Palestinians DNA because of the establishment of the state of Israel in Nineteen forty eight warrants demands that there'll be some sort of military victory some sort of um he will Jima moments of raising the flag\nWhere they can say that their\n... their opinion very equals if they've achieved they've achieved Harry\nAnd both both sides um in in how they approach the world and how they approach the very very small neighborhood\nUm are are bent ... nations are doomed to fail so perhaps what might be the wiser course of action is or is the change of the mathematical equation and to try something different to try something where I'm different\nSorts of ... of landmarks and milestones can be reached in order to get to a place of coexistence and to this day that really hasn't been attempted\nBrian in Indianapolis Brian go ahead sir hey George good morning he bright\nHey listen ah man what a what a mess over there in the middle east and and and than it used to ride all the horses are wrong are no good over there or outside of Israel and look at all the American blood been spilled over there over the decades\nAnd it just seems like nothing has changed but my question is a wish William Buckley this is the forgotten the history that nobody you know really remembers\nBut if he gave up secret and I don't know if you know he did or not was your any trickle down collateral damage to the field officer of the ... of the CIA that were out in the field or from the information that he might have given up and keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off\nThe air you got to give you that question [noise]\nFrom ... in that he might have given up and keep up the good work and I'll take my answer off the air you got to give you that question\n[noise] sure a good question Brian uh answer your question is uh uh at the\nTime or the agency the CIA um could not take any more chances meaning ah in essence they they removed all the personnel assigned to the station or got them out of a country a slap\nThey had to shut down or their source network or and anticipate a the entire ... chain that that had been compromised there\nOr they had to shut down safe houses are where are you meet with informants are in anticipation that perhaps bill or had disclosed that uh so uh you have that trickle down effect and there's also a damage assessment that comes into play here to\nWhere you start thinking about um you know the intelligence services exist to steal secrets and so here you have a\nUh the CIA the CIA point man in Lebanon that have access to everything\nOr what value is that to another intelligence service so if you're the Iranian intelligence service for example a Kenyan horse trader swap with a let's say a the Russian KGB at the time so those are the kinds of things that you have to anticipate and you look at it from a worst case scenario\nAnd you shut down everything so ah was ah operations compromise or a operations were are certainly shutdown stopped or until a complete damage assessment is done to see how bad things are\nAnd then you have to restart a year entire um human collection network a which is never easy\nSam what's happening to Lebanon today what's the situation there\nUh well I'm a Hezbollah is perhaps the most powerful political party in the country while I'm Hezbollah has um stockpiled hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles that aims to Israel has vilified her as we're getting on\nOn short on characteristics we I'm I'm a crucial combat experience and counter insurgency um capabilities\nFighting in Syria um the the Lebanese fighters in\nIn in Syria have played a significant role in in ... being able to the Assad regime being able to remain in power\nOn Hezbollah remains I'm One of the world's largest narcotics traffickers a money laundering of 'em you name it we've outpost so throughout the world including South America\nAnd has ... remains a clear and present danger to the United states Israel in western interests throughout the middle east\nGerman why do they deal with the cartels are that are in South America\nUm yes there is a very large Shiite population in South America in Argentina in Columbia Venezuela I'm In a previous work that I did um um we learned that um the the government of president during in Venezuela\nUm had a um a a shuttle service\nOn the Venezuelan UM Airlines traveling to Damascus and I'm bringing in narcotics to Lebanon of course everybody along the way it goes ... and then from Lebanon B word dispersed\nThroughout um points throughout the um Europe in the middle east um\nAnd living on the birth throughout um point throughout the um Europe in the middle east um\nMoney the money from those cells were laundered I'm In West Africa um some of the money would smuggle the result of the on hiring in the United states um it is a global criminal enterprise\nUnbelievable I I've always felt we should just legalize all drugs shut up ... you know clinics to help people but legalized drugs don't put people in jail or will stop people from robbing people because of the prices will plummet\nAnd it's one way you're getting these people who are making all the Germans drugs and distributed um what do you think\n... a large portion of his ... budget come from um illegal activities and I I think you know when we think about that we have to remember the more important than the religious elements more important\nAnd as you report says without silver there would be no solar\nExactly that's why some experts are calling for one hundred dollar silver and according to the world silver survey demand is

UFOs\nOh yeah oh we love talking about a year in London is of\nA especially down in the Bahamas special around a place called hot tech a which is actually the Navy's area fifty one is actually in the Bahamas and the middle of the triangle in fact a lot of us so reports down there we love talking about\nThem something's happening where St Lucie these lights down there the bottom floor of the ocean and then all of a sudden this object just burst run out of the ocean and often goes it's amazing\nThe ocean is a good place to hide it you know if you were up to a you know who knows what a lot of secret weapons and so on but\nIt's a big or the ocean is is it not that there's been a lot of people who have thing that I think that it may be UFOs come from the ocean you know you know maybe that's just one of those another thing that we can't possibly understand right now but a lot of people do see them\nWhy do you think people ... or so fascinated with the unusual and the pure normal I mean hence you show my show I mean people love this stuff they can't get enough of it how come\nI um I think it makes our lives seem a little a less often every you know it makes them a little extraordinary\nThat these things happening around us all the time you know we just don't ... that was the head of the book came from the haunted universe that maybe maybe we live in the universe where everything goes wrong and the other universes that are supposed to be like as everything goes right maybe we're in the one that you know um but um I\nDon't know I've always found it fascinating because you look at day to day life it just seems like there's a route painful life and then all of a sudden you know somebody you know sees that goes to someone you know has seen a UFO and and like it's just that kind of unreal part of life that kind of touches you and I don't know I just find it fascinating\nYou'd think people have a need to be scared baffled\nI think they I think a lot of people have a need to be baffled you know I Do you know and then you you hear about something and you look into it and you\nYou learn a you know something that you didn't know before I think some people like to be scared you know I think there's an adrenaline rush and if that's why the scary movies are movies are so popular\nUm I you know who knows I think it may go back to when we used to all sit around the campfire and you had to make sure that your alert all through the night so something bad happens so\nYou know who knows but you know you're right a lot of people like it or in all forms of it the medium\nAnd we ... we want to be careful because you know we want to believe that big foot\nExist as a creature that it's not some ape out there in the woods we want to believe that you will ... come from other planetary systems and it's not just some\n... nature throwing a plasma balls or anything like that we want to believe that there's an afterlife and goes to the real thing\nWe really get disappointed when I you know the reality of some of these things pops up and you realize well this was just a natural occurrence or or you know you know some kind of electrical discharge and the clouds or whatever\nIn his pops up and you realize well this was just a natural occurrence or or you know some kind of electrical discharge and the clouds or whatever it was it\nGets to be disappointing doesn't it\nShould because then you know once you get it it it makes the outlets say illusion of life young seem ordinary in a way you know that that\nBut they can't be an explanation for everything that's the way I I kinda look at it you know that they're out of the things that happen out there and you certainly a big pot of all kinds of different just strange things\nAh people see things and you know they can't be making up they can't be hoaxes that we have instances of the book where you know hundreds of people out of the people a different kind of paranormal type stuff\nSo that has to be something behind it maybe it's all tied in together you know I'm Talking about this on the show a lot that may be big footing goes in UFOs Loch Ness monster all the whole thing all comes from the same thing when the first people to think about that but we talk about it a lot\nUm but it's ... it's an endless fascination with us in with a lot of people\nWell and you write about this important aspect not all these people are making things up or lying or mistaken in even if you have a hundred people\nIn Ninety nine of them are making these stories that they she goes to new lows and big foot you've got that one person who's not lying who has seen something very unusual in that that's what fuels me that's why I continue looking for these answers\nBecause that that one person is the reason that I go after these stories\n... ... it all it takes is one ghost story to be true and they might as well be true\nI tell Linda ... who's a reporter Mac or she's an expert in crops formations and a truly believes that most of the crop formations are made from other sources other than man and\nOne of those sources could be could be UFOs could be the earth's doing it as a vehicle to communicate with us whatever it is she thinks most of them were done that way and I told her I says Linda\nIt doesn't matter because even if all of them except one ... is the unusual one it's an amazing story it's it's the story of the lifetime\nCan absolutely for sure and I are like a ghost story you know if you could talk to if there's one person who has come back here from the afterlife that's it was amazing thing that's ever happened ever\nWere you in the you were in the UFOs is a little boy were you raised religious Mac because there's a photo of questions that\nAre not really you know I grew up in digester which was the kind of working class out of Boston you know we were we were Catholics and and I you know life kinda revolves around the Catholic Church and the school and you know and so on and so forth but not open not overly religious you know\nWhen you were you out there when Albert DeSalvo the Boston strength was out there doing his thing ...\nSame neighborhood and I'm Sorry to say but\nYeah I thought so I thought what an amazing story that was show yeah and wasn't he a family man\nA well he had a ... kind of a not a drifter but you know he um he never really held a lot of stable job then you know there's a lot of people think that it didn't do it that he was actually framed by the cost because they needed somebody\nTo um you know to to arrest and because there was I can remember it as a kid you know it was the headlines all the time\nThe time you know this guy you know ... a lot of women right in in our little area and um you know there was some stuff that he didn't know about some of them are undecided but who knows but one once he went to jail\nIn in our area and um [noise] you know there was some stuff that he didn't know about some of them are undecided but who knows but one once he went to jail they did stop so\nYeah they did stop and there could have been a few copycat something to me\nThat is true they're always on the lookout for those\nHow did you accumulate the stories for hunted universe how did you get them\nWell uh you know once again had boxes of all this different research in that for a while I worked for a very tore a website that was part of a true TV PBS's\nUh-huh okay yeah they just decide me to you know five Fifteen odd stories or a month and that just you know I I bought lots of books on line and so on and just accumulated all this uh filed piles of a strange stories\nAre you still finding new stories Mac\n... all the time yeah uh-huh I'm sure\nThey don't stop and I'm sure you've got some favorites or after we come back from the break rules we'll talk about haunted universe and go through some of these stories will have time for them and then we'll take calls next don't work as well and I'm sure you've got your own favorites don't you\nOh I sure do yeah uh-huh\nAnd unusual once I get a lot of strange calls to the radio program ah there was one where a police officer cold and he said that the it had a cold that there was a heart attack victim in the house and they got there before the EMTs he and his partner\nAnd they get to the door and the little man opens the door to let them in and they go rushing in and they see on the floor the body of another old man they pulled him over they turn him over right 'cause he's on his stomach they ruin them over and it's a little man let them in\nA while they turn around and that guy is gone in there he is dead on the floor\n... stories like that makes you think wow what's going on\nSo we got a call from an EMT who was on the scene of an accident and she was she was not working and so she stopped her own car got out when running saw the body and the side of the road\nUm was looking at the body see somebody standing by her car and said please call nine one one it was the guy that died\nWow wow on yet\nAnd they I mean you can't make that stuff on it\nYeah right we did a story in the book record of someone who called a a real estate company asking that his house to be sold and when the real estate company looked into it or they actually got in touch with the person's wife and it turns out that you know it it just passed away\nAnd his wife sell the house and it's amazing how do you get your ...\nLeft a message on a message machine which was you know\nThat's where they they seem to like electronics\nRight they do yeah I've I've heard that before that that is some kind of electronic connection may be too I don't know the afterlife voices from\nBeyond sure is hunted university

I don't remember specifically desert for so long ago now um but they were about to do that and uh you know in in the two next week we're going to show you what's going on in the middle of a sudden ... next week never came and I looked at for weeks and weeks\nBefore I finally realized in history did that with that other show to the um the zodiac killer sure I Know yeah\nFor whatever reason they seem to take those shows off and ... well you just you know these shows will be serial\nKillers and some disappear when there were so intriguing suggest I don't know if you've heard my a question before we lost you there but I was saying that um I had been tj watched uh the episodes of American River and um you know I got to the last episode I was hooked\nI kept waiting for the next one to show up it never did I was very very disappointed in I suspect there are people all over the country if not the world there were similar will be disappointed\n[laughter] yeah I get I get that same um emotion and failing almost everywhere I go but I got to tell you all history was incredible to work with\nUh they they hire the best people possible I mean our director or producers the actors that they hire to play you know old and my co star Amarillo spots is is just going to be a superstar see the film and then for networks right now\nAnd you know history was incredible work with so you know those those guys are extreme professionals in the entertainment business and and they they had a good reason I'm sure and I'm hoping they uh reopen at one day and uh I I'd like to go back and do some more work with them on it\nWell in JV made a good point it was like all of a sudden your show disappeared the zodiac killer show disappeared and some other ones in it almost seemed like they sort of just stepped away from the serial killer aspect of just trying to trying to get into their heads and figure out what was truly going on in the real history behind it\nBut that's what history is about and I agree with you know History Channel there's some great people over there I've I've talked with with many individuals\nWho worked there and who are high up there and it's it's just a great great bunch of people\nKnow and um\nYou know they put a lot of money to America river guys when when we first budget it you know the ... of the whole is great you know the numbers were a hundred two hundred thousand dollars a day ended up costing the million dollars so\nYou know for cable TV network they they went they put their toll on the line and and they they they went for the the the bleachers with the\nYou know what their swaying and I can never criticize them ever for that\nYeah of course there's no reason to criticize you know people make decisions and program decisions based on whatever they have to use to baseless decisions on it's just as a lot of people that that were kind of a hooked in and left hanging so\nJust remind me because I don't want to get into any of this deeper discussion before this breaks will have a couple of minutes here but remind me where did the did American River leave off you were just about to excavate the area in front of the post office weren't you\n[noise] you know that\nI'm working on that now that something much bigger project than the eggs and nation of the grave I mean I'm going to have to get permission from the department of justice the FBI it's going to be an incredible a process I'm going to do it\nAnd I'm going to find a network that wants to back me up on but you know when we ended up American River we we had a ... the grave the University of Pennsylvania the anthropologist there you know these Nobel Prize winners we're going through the ... trying to make an identity\nThe grave the University of Pennsylvania the anthropologist there you know ... Nobel Prize winners we're going through the remains trying to make an identification which the court had ordered them to do we were waiting for DNA results\nAnd pretty much the show just end it there and just left a lot of people out hanging and you should see and I had hours ... thousands of emails and tax asking me hey Jeff what the heck happened and to tell you guys the truth I didn't know\nKnew we lose to look she again Jim I Know I'm I'm ... do you do you maybe you got to get a call or something 'cause you could out for a second\nNo I got to tell you guys I've never had a problem with my phone and not you know we're um we're I like you say we're cutting in and out a little bit\nAnd it's always are full [laughter]\nSo so um again you you saying that um the exhumation they were trying to identify the remains it was just the state order from the state of Pennsylvania what do I don't remember if there was any determination if you actually if we saw the conclusion of that on the on the program it's been so long\n[noise] you know I I was\nWatching the show myself I hadn't seen the final episode the final cut\nAnd when it ended I was shocked and then the next day NBC News came out\nWith a report that DNA and dental records that prove that connection between me and my grandfather and I called the I called NBC News up and say what what are you guys doing where you get these DNA reports I haven't seen one and they belong to me by the court order\nAnd it went on for two or three weeks like that until finally NBC News was forced to retract their statements that the DNA had matched\nBut unfortunately Jason as you know how it happens you know their headlines sake DNA batches Jeff might just the legend them now and the rumors are done when they retracted they put it on page five in this little box that no one gets three\nRight exactly yeah that's how it always goes it is so the so again the final disposition of all that is what\nWell and you know I Would uh if you had history on right now or you can there would be an argument but I Believe\nThat we prove it wasn't only in the graves and not a substitute was not only executed but buried in his place and he went off with a blank check\nTo visit those that had irritated if you know the New York times wrote about back calling it the homes curse the jury foreman the prosecutor the trial judge some of them died some of them suffered terrible misfortune\nBut you know I look at those things as as I wasn't given a choice and I'm not going to run away from that as everyone else in my family had for at least a hundred years\nBut with what you were saying Jeff you you you have the belief that the genetic makeup or when ever made him do this has been passed down genetically correct through through a DNA and so forth but of course you're in your control that you're not following the same path you\nKnow and really no one in my family has only I mean my father was a war hero my my grandfather was very successful my great grandfather was a mayor in Florida I doubt any of them even had\nA you know a citation for Jay walking except you know we all knew we were different Jay me and\nYou know this this sudden you know knock on the door with this identification of you know a man who had perhaps the highest IQ ever recorded at the University of Michigan he probably could have been a Louis ... store had he wanted the beach and instead he went off on this path of evil\nAnd it was something that history has largely swept under the rug and I\nAnd I still believe guys you know with shows like yours\nThere's a chance that we could learn something about what makes a brilliant man like this evolving just such a monster\nSo how much how much can you tell us about the DNA work and any of the work that was done it hasn't aired on his show yet or are these things that you're saving you want to present in the in some more sophisticated for\nNo no no it's it's a the DNA out I I ah gave a talk in Michigan this summer a matter of fact Jason your old partner grant was there\nAnd you know I I ah revealed to the audience why I Believe the DNA\nMatter of fact Jason your old partner grant was there and you know I I ah revealed to the audience why I Believe the DNA ... you know we we eggs on the ... the body and from the grave we took DNA samples\nI'm at the University of Pennsylvania with incredible anthropologist these were these were ladies that you know they research the pyramids on this thing and they ...\nThey're just they're amazing scientists um we sent it to the most renowned DNA lab in the world in London I mean history was paying up you know they they were really fundamental measure and\nWe waited and waited and waited all summer long for some results until finally\nYou know the University of Pennsylvania and this was in private conversations with me they gave up on the DNA and they decided they make the id based on T alone\nAnd then when I saw NBC News ... come out with these headlines about in a DNA matching mine you know I went off the deep end than uh uh we were ready to file\nLawsuits well of course until finally finally NBC back down on that and you know in my mind there's no doubt whatsoever the DNA never match um\nWhich was what the court order to be done for the identification\nAnd instead the scientists made the ID that it was home based on a medical record of a of a strange Dr dentist that had visited homes in prison before the execution a dead men walking examination\nBut now guys you'll you'll find his dad's name we're starting to uncover evidence that Holmes actually request that this man to do the examination and the dental records that they used to compare with the body we exhausted that\nWere never homes is in the first place and we're trying to track that down now because anything involving homes he played played chess in everything he did that's the time he was the the Chicago Tribune called them the greatest fraud that ever struck Chicago\nAnd everything he was was a game of chess and I tried to convince the scientist at the U. Penn of this that ... not to jump in to this silly evidence of teeth\nTo make their determination but you know as scientists there they looked at the stuff and they saw numbers in data that all worked out for them despite you know me telling them hey this was the guy who made a living substituting that diverse\nHiring dentist to make fake teeth and then showing the tea to an insurance company to pull off the fraud on the insurance policy itself and I said this was just his ammo when you've gotta you've got to realize that before you make the decision and\nUnfortunately I couldn't I couldn't get them to see who we were dealing with\nWell and it was a guy who understood how the authorities and everybody looked at death so you already had the perfect ability to cover it up and make it appear as this is is he was dead in a certain way and move on\nI mean I tried to explain to them this was the guy that built the murder castle hotel in preparation for the world's fair coming to Chicago I mean if if there's a picture of a premeditated murder in the you know blacks law dictionaries should be of homes and the murder castle\nAnd I see you as you said he was the master of the science of death and then faking the cause of that death and then hiding any evidence\nAnd ... of death and then faking the cause of that death and then hiding any evidence or remains that good you know place him in jeopardy as far as legal guilt\nAnd it's something you know I'll get to it I'll get to the bottom of it shows like yourself a lot and I want to thank you again\nAnd with the you know the fan base that I'm building now people fascinated with this horrible man it's only a matter of time it's just\nIt's just hard work it's like you know and now I'm I'm dealing with the you know I'm doing some back and forth with the department of justice and the FBI about them giving me permission to excavate sixty third and Wallace where the murder capital once stood it's now a United States post office which is federal property\nSo I Will have to have the attorney general of the United states and the director of the FBI sign off on my request which is you guys know is going to take a couple of years but it will happen because when they bought that property guys the murder castle was still standing\nThey tore it down they build over the ... the spot and then they built the post office largely over the top but mostly over the side\nAnd in doing so they knew what the building was they knew murders had been committed there and they knew\nThose victims had never been identified in and I'm trying to be gentle with the FBI guys I I don't want to get in a fight with them I Want them to do this of their own free will knowing that\nYou know America doesn't do that we don't cover a mass graves of identified citizens in in one of our major cities\nAnd we can turn that around by you know having the Paul university by having History Channel step back and but you know excavating those grounds and then using DNA to identify some of Holmes's victims and and uh I don't I don't have any doubt they're going to agree eventually\nBut it's going to be a two or three year process\nWell I Know you actually took a good friend of mine and the executive producer to the basement of a building Mike Nichols you probably remember that and it\nMight it make you know what Jason Mike is one of my favorite guys and all of TV\nYeah actually it was me my executive producer and go Centers for the last five years of the show six years in the show is just a great guy\nYeah I agree
