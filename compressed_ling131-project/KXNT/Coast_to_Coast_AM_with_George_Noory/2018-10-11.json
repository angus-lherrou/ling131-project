staggered with us her latest work the power of age limit\nShould amazing how it works and does it take much effort to make things happen\nWell that was the interesting thing about this no it doesn't I think would it take is meeting regularly it it takes some techniques and you know in my book the power of eight I've got all the techniques that people have to to follow to become a really good in tender\nAnd also to intend well in a group\nBut for me the thing the real key element is creating a little group of eight or so and you asked before yeah they have to be a no\nFive all work eleven or work you know eight is kind of a Goldilocks figure you know it's like the not too big not too little\nUm but what's really important is meeting week after week after week and I found that after I'm putting people in groups in twenty Fifteen I wanted to do my own experiment because I wanted to see if everything in their lives would begin to heal not just their health\nSo I got a group of two hundred and fifty together and have them you know I taught them for a while and then I put them in groups of eight or so and had the meat every week for a whole year\nAnd it was extraordinary of the people who continued to meet regularly you know every week and that was about a hundred and fifty of them pretty much a hundred percent of them had major life changing experience is so it wasn't just their health\nYou know they got financial windfall or they got amazing new careers or they made up with this strange relatives or you know they got a great new house just the one they wanted\nUm just came out of nowhere or they found a new life purpose but it pretty much everybody had extraordinary stories to tell\nOur our ... are you sure that this works uh primarily from the field or is there a science behind\n[noise] well I think this is science in the sense\nThat brainwaves study and we found that you know there are major brain changes that go on when you do intention of in a group called ... group prayer in a way I'm In a sense that's what it is it's kind of secular prayer because you have these major changes\nWhich are really very very much similar to somebody having a mystical state you know somebody having a mystical experience\nPeople get changed during those kinds of experiences and they allow themselves to be open to a lot of possibilities or they suddenly feel you know\nSomething major his change all their senses are heightened um they feel really optimistic about their future and so in a way that starts to pave the way if you want to just look at what happens to the individual that paved the way for major changes\nAnd and possibilities but there's something more there's a bigger piece of this George that\nAnd believe me I'm trying to figure out what is it is a group of fact you know is it just the power of intention but a big piece of this is the power of altruism\nUm that was the big surprise for me because remember this Sanders we're having amazing affects to healing effects\nAnd when I started looking into um the science of altruism it's extraordinary I mean people who do stuff for other people no matter how small live longer are happier are healthier in every regard\nAnd nuts what we found in a lot of our intention groups I mean when I talk about that group and twenty Fifteen and I was studying for a whole year\nI'm One of the people you know there were a couple of people that weren't getting anywhere you know one of them was a woman called Andy and Andy was going through a divorce\nAnd she had two small kids she needed a new job and she was very talented in marketing and coaching and she just couldn't get anything you know young woman\nJust couldn't get anything and she was just trying everything and we talked with her and tried to work with her and this and that are group tried to work with her and finally I was a bit frustrated by it and I just said oh Andy get off of yourself start intending for someone else\nAnd she was one of the people who was intending for that young boy Luke\nAnd the moment she did that she gets a coal out of the blue from somebody offering her a dream job so\nCan I tell you any everything about how this works you're absolutely not [laughter]\nThere is a complete X factor here I don't understand but there is something about that power of getting off for yourself and doing for someone else that seems to get\nA reward for you but you're convinced that word orange\nI Am convinced it works I watch it as I say I sort of look at it almost like a scientist I've looked at it\nStudying groups over years\nUm you know I run I run these year long master classes and I'm I'm actually evaluating what's happening to people they're filling out forms every month to say what's changed in their lives\nAnd you know we've done the brain studies were gonna do immune systems studies um and just seeing what happens in groups right in front of me you know I Know it works\nOr then or there's some are women don't get results in the ...\nThink it's the people who don't come regularly\nUm sometimes it's nothing to do with skepticism that's the interesting thing too I gave a talk once in in Denver last last year\nAnd there was a woman who had really bad arthritis and she was a total skeptic and she got healed right away like there and um you know we've had people like that who haven't who were a little skeptical really didn't you know what to themselves yeah right\nAnd they had some healing doesn't mean everybody in an audience gets healed but a lot of them you know there's enough to say something really interesting is going on here\nAnd are you interested in the human because it's easier to track in terms of the ...\nOh you mean a physical healing well yeah because it is it's easy to ... you know somebody had a condition they don't have the conditions we\nHad a woman was staged for cancer I talked about earlier and she's now you know down to normal numbers now she was doing other stuff too but the intention pushed it right along somebody else with T. M. J. problems as a temporary mandated dealer joint problems in your jaw\nAnd uh that she was sort of suffering with the pain of eight or nine out of ten and it went immediately down to two and then the pain was gone over days\nSo this kind of thing you know it's kind of this healed in an instant or soon after is the thing that you can as you say really track but then you've got other things we're amazing synchronous a tease happen you know another woman who was\nTrying to write a book she was a body work um expert Lisa\nAnd she was in one of these year long groups and she was trying to write a book about she figured out a way to treat trauma victims with body work and she wanted to write this book about it she'd never written a book and she was getting no where\nShe had three different editors and just nothing was happening and at the group was intending for nothing was happening and finally once again I simply say get off for yourself and she started it intending to another member of the group who had some ... serious health issues\nAnd again the next week she has she feels compelled to go into a store\nAnd she didn't even need anything at the store and when she gets in there she meets somebody she vaguely been introduced to before and\nA nonprofit agency that help working families achieved prosperity through savings save her life will help you said ended that can you feature\nYou'll receive weekly coaching emails reminders to save and you can earn up to sixty dollars in reward for saving your own money that's right you'll get hate to say\nIt's not too good to be true Jessica ... says she has a whopping testimony that the program works\nThe program is real and you do have\nLearned more I'd save her life dot org slash Nevada that save her life dot org slash Nevada so what are you waiting for this message sponsored by nonprofit earned aired in cooperation with the Nevada broadcasters association and the station\nFrom the just the ... studios T.

inherent contradiction to they have consequences right\nAbsolutely absolutely so\nIt's about really telling the universe what you want I mean I Know that you're a a journalist too and so you'll recognize the five W's in age I usually tell people you know what reporters have to learn is when they write a lead of a story they write in an intro they have to do\nWho what when where and why and how\nAnd and that's not a bad thing to do and you're formulating an intention\nIs your story includes all those ingredients you got a pretty good story\nExactly and for an intention it's the same thing you've got to say what do you want\nYou know the number of people on my master class who will do things like I Want to be rich\nAnd you know they don't really want to be rich what they want is usually you know in the sense of having loads and loads of money and more stuff what they want is\nThey don't want the job there in what they want is not to worry so much anymore they need a certain amount of money they may not necessarily need to be rich\nUm what they want is more time to spend with their children or grandchildren and so what you have to do is try to figure out first what you want what is that you really want and then tell the universe exactly what you want\nAnd the other thing I notice George is often times the universe\nAnd then tell the universe exactly what you want and the other thing I notice George is often times the universe gives us what we need not necessarily what we're trying to say we need like\nUm I had one group one master class a intention group of eight and they said well were intended for all of us to win the lottery [laughter] and I said to them why what do you need and they said well\nGene needs twelve thousand dollars I'm for child and Joan needs another Fifteen thousand dollars to get a car and so and so needs this and that and I said well why do you intend for the meat individually and ask for what exactly they need because that's probably what the universe is going to give you\nYou know so it's it's really about first of all figuring out what you want exactly\nAnd then telling ... yeah exactly well here's an opportunity for you to talk with Lynn Mick Jagger and about intention let's start by going to Thomas a mobile you California Tom\nGeorge thank you for taking my call limb yeah it's really a pleasure of comment and then a question um I was just you know your audio a lecture programs one called living the\nFields and the other one called living with intention and boy those audio compact desks are in constant rotation on my CD player I just want you to know that they're just have so much information now unique unique about\nRetro causality\nRetro in ... and you cite a number of experiments that appear to prove that\nWe can not only in ... for the president but we can chat and for the past that the past is not fixed in stone so to speak that there appears to be with experimental proof you cite a lot of researchers\nThere appears to be a robust cross talk between the past and the future and you cite ... how much met a job up here a group in Princeton and each of the experiments that they did that appear to show\nThat you can influence the past that the past is not fixed my question for you can you utilize retro intention retro causality for healing [noise]\nThat's such a great question thank you yes the answer is the short answer is yes\nNow I Do this all the time in my master classes in workshop some I just read a retreat in Italy last week and we were doing a lot of retro intention one I tend to do though is you can't change the past of what\nOf what happened in the sense of it happened what you can do though is changed your response to it and going forward and in a way that is part of this whole thing of time being really elastic time being one big smeared out now\nAnd that's what the studies you're talking about demonstrate is that you know we what they really show is that and this is a weird thing um we don't change the past we changed the president\nReally show is that and this is a weird thing um we don't\nChange the past we changed the president as it unfolds the future affects the present as it unfolds all those studies show but just to answer your question why tend to do is ask people to go back to a seed moment\nTo moment in their health just when something just started before it blew up to full blown disease a moment where they first argument argued with somebody in a relationship\nAnd it then deteriorated afterwards just that moment when it started or a moment when somebody told you you weren't good enough as a child or you were terrible at something we\nJust just did something like that and go back and change your response to that teacher and you say no I'm not used to set math I just don't understand is now I Will later\nSomething like that or imagine that that\nHealing that that illness\nDoesn't blow up into full blown disease I'm actually had somebody who got ... from an infection go back and imagine that time and I swear to you know she told us her skin was starting to re pigment in the workshop\nIt was extraordinary and loads of people where\nThey were they were told something and it's in his sense released it for them going forward so it's an interesting little technique but there's plenty more to mess around with with retro intention because even\nStandard physicists now are saying to us all um\nYou know time is it what we thought it was it's not just for we're going era that we thought from cradle to grave it's much more as I said like one big smeared out now and one big smeared out here for space\nRich in Monterey, California is with us here a rich go ahead\nYeah hey can you hear me don't carry a speaker phone all the only good pretty good\nOkay 'cause it's kind of hard to hear you I Want to thank you and listen\nI'm your conversation is so ...\nIt's almost what you have all the time let me give you a\nA thing um I grew up\nKind of Catholic and I heard the story that you know some people will never die of course Feinstein says energy on these changes farm so you know that kind of back me up my whole life\nSo I was a little kid I like to be multiple I'm an electric karate learned how to teach and\nIt talks about one percent of the doubt and get your nose broke like 'cause your focus is gone um so now I'm divorced from the same live twice I have a daughter she's not talk to me all the stuff happens but on such a positive person I knew I Would be sixty one years old not working\nBeing taken care of and I am really healing I could barely walk through years ago 'cause all the stress of all the stuff now my ex wife still my friend she may even be my third wife again\nThird time [laughter] but I Do not focus\nWell on my intention even though I'm On my third book\nOf poetry and stuff picture of homes and stuff but I live in my poetry exactly what I Want but I don't really visualize it I'm such a positive person I'm going to have a a hippie hard so\n... exactly what I Want but I don't really ... I'm such a positive person I Want to have a\nA hippie hard setting where people just come and visit and we do this ... thing that you're talking about and that just get them to be happy for a minute or a couple of minutes and go on them right away\nAnd you're suggesting that the little group to change that they're wrong that is how it's gonna happen so my question is I have I broke my body working a hammer gun for Thirteen Years\nUm I have ripped the shoulders ligaments or actually broken so every time I worked out it hurts like hell so not only not work out again after a year break\nI have to decide to myself that maybe that pain is actually growing and I should ignore it or not have to happen again\nWell how does he get rid of bin Lyn tell us when we come back\nLet's get Lee or sky high silver report in some fascinating report and don't miss out on the ... revolution called ...\nTo nine nine Seventy four hundred [noise]\n\nThis online banks for closing on us they even have documents that I signed for a home equity loan only I didn't want to ...\nShe's the victim of a devastating crime called mortgage fraud your ... title and mortgage are kept on line where these foreign and domestic hack them it's simple the Ford your title and borrow every penny of equity you happen to your whole life this police officer\nI Know about title fraud so I register with home title walk and discovered some these had already taken over title thank God I found out on time\nNo bank identity theft program or insurance protects you whole title luck will for pennies today whole title lock puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant did detect scampering there on it helping to shut it down find out if you're already a victim of title fraud\nGet your hundred dollar searched free with somebody to visit home title luck dot com\nHome title luck dot com\nYou're concerned about your heart house or know someone who it then you should consider\nCardio mobile the NBA cleared personal EKG device for just Ninety nine dollars [noise] cardio mobile delivers a medical grade EKG right to your smartphone and it\nFits in your pocket so you can take it EKG anytime anywhere to order basic cardio dot com bend K.

[noise]\nWe are back with our final segment with Lynn Mick Jagger blend in the book the power of age what would you say was the most compelling the aspect of it that you came across\n[noise] well I think it was\nThe probably that so many instances killings and I think that it was really shocking to me\nThat it wasn't just help that we've healing 'cause you know you could almost explain that by saying well it's the big feel good effect on the immune system things like that\nUm but for instance Natalie Lancaster I mean I it was shocking to me cases like this she was one of the receivers in a power of age group and she wanted her intention to be that her family business expand in all directions and be prosperous an own ways\nAnd she and her husband had a computer support in business but it it didn't build on just two major clients and they were you know they ...\nShe and her husband had a computer support in business but it had been built on just two major clients and they were you know they ... they had just heard that one of their two clients was about to take their business elsewhere and they were really worried because\nThey had lost money from a Ponzi scheme about a decade before and they had to file for bankruptcy and so she was really frightened that she was going to have to take a job I'm In real estate again flipping houses in order to survive\nSo she can't during the group session she kept visualizing both her and mark opening up their car doors and money spilling out\nAnd afterward her feeling about it for fear and her depression seemed to lift but what was really interesting is opportunities just started opening up for them they suddenly their business received a steady stream of smaller clients and within a few months\nShe they learn not only did that major client decided to stay with them but they completely diversified their client list\nAnd she and her husband had other big opportunities to um she had ... certain offers she paints is a hobby and she was a given offers to do her painting and mark was trying to do a sideline business training full program that took off\nAnd it was just amazing for her she thought that something about the power of aid group\nNot only performed magic but helped her and her husband trust in self empowerment and the possibility of prosperity and I think that's what's so incredible for me is to watch everything in people's lives begin to heal\nAnd you do develop intention in your dreams [laughter]\nThat's a great question I think we are intending in our dream state in a weird way though you know we're intending you know somebody calls a dreams R B roll you know we call it weird weird stuff going on there and dreams but they are\nOften times ... cognitive you know they're forecasting all the time I mean I was fascinated to see when I was studying\nYou know time the fact that time is so elastic and not this one way arrow\nI was really interested to find that\nThat um a lot of people a lot of people ... dreamed the nine eleven\nUm interest attacks um Rupert\nRate did a study of it and found so many people had dreams of it of planes going into buildings that has a high rise buildings\nAnd maybe not even in New York but they had that kind of very very specific dream and also they know that the Titanic had a record number of people um cancel their tickets for that maiden voyage the one that sank\nAnd the the somehow they knew ahead of time so we're picking up all\nAll kinds of information ahead of time it's not beyond the realm of possibility that we're also sending out what we want to have happened were thinking about it\nThe key though is I think being really specific as I mentioned before and also the power of a group you know we had before our break we had that caller call in about how to fix all of his his illnesses you know his pain and\nI really got to say that the one way is to get a power of aid group together because let them in ten for you be very specific about where your pain is that you want to heal the pain in your you know if you've\nOther because let them in ten for you be very specific about where your pain is that you want to heal\nThe pain in your you know if you've got a painting your left so I'm left\nBig toe you know focus on that he really he really specific about it\nAnd if you don't have I should say if you don't have seven other good

anything backfire doing is\nNo nothing I mean we've had\nPeople who say they feel worse for a little while you know after they've done the intention maybe they feel a little bit more pain that it usually resolves and it's so much better\nSo I've never had an instance yet where somebody has really got worse over this and nothing you know at worst nothing has happened\nBut in most cases if they persist at it if they keep meeting with their group big things and big changes to start happening\nOkay let's go to the phones was picking up by going to crunch truck driving in Louisiana first time

I think you're Romney asleep linked never lean with fallen angel\nLike are we know the stories from Sunday school even though\nHow looser for I'm I'm a rebel against God and took all those with him or who also rebels and they became the humans and things like that are yet that is that is the Christian mythology I'm\nA ... nobody was there nobody actually recorded history we don't know that that actually ever happen but that is what the coming down the fall when the angels were then equated with those who sell those who came down\nYet never lean has nothing to do with the angels um it has to do with offspring or with being that were created beings that existed um you have in the passage where their first mentioned in the book of genesis it talks about how and in those days\nAre the sons of God they came down an intermingle with the daughters of men and had children by them and then it says and then the then the ... were on the earth and those days and also afterward when the son of God came down and intermingled with the daughters of men\nI used to think that the ... were the offspring\nOf the different intermingling of the sons of God what's the daughters of mad but the passage doesn't actually say that um it's best that they were on the wrist in those days and also afterward um\nAnd by the way the sons of God as we read it in English and genesis six of the sons of God in in the ...\nThe word um and by the way the sons of God as we read it in English and genesis six is the sons of God and in the Hebrew it's the Benet ... L team and again you have that theme of except the and the other team and the ... and the I Love you\nAnd police state of the ban a hot schemes simply means the sons of the God of many God\nAnd I love hearing was the name given for God almost two thousand I'm Sorry three thousand times\nThe Old Testament passages and that's one of the names used for God and uh he literally means el is the word for God\nOff and the theme of a plurality though it was the name for God is the God of many gods were among many God is the name used for God\nThree thousand times in the Old Testament and it says the sons of the L O team\nOf the God of many gods the sons of the God of any gone are the ones who just send it to the earth and impregnated human women loved to them it's says took them as wives and so on and then you've got the ... these characters which are\nA it's a bit and ... and a medic because it doesn't really say they were the ... of this intermingling but it says they were there and so there was always\nI Know in the book I wrote about it I have mentioned them as being the children are the offspring of the sons of God or the fellow he or the watchers is some books called them\nAnd we have just about him and his name now before before the break I read somewhere about equating with giant ... is is there any truth to that or is that completely false\nYou know that was that was one of the translations early on in the sixteen eleven King James version of the Bible they translated ... giant and it says and there were giants and the earth in those days as a matter of fact you go to the way up to the story of David and Goliath\nUm and it talks about Goliath being a giant but it said he was he was of the sons of the ... lean he and his three brothers and a and they also call him a giant and they give us a measurement is\nSix Cuban tennis fan which is roughly nine and a half feet\nAnd so you've got this particular now I've heard some of the legends or the myth of the ... or the giants have them at thirty six feet tall and they would have to eat herds of thousands of votes every day to sustain themselves\nWell I think you're pretty much would have run out of sheep and goats\nBy that time or if they lived\nThat there is another a civilized the race out there somewhere I mean I don't understand why that's a stretch\nI I I I Love that question because it's so important to me and because I spent\nSo much of my life addressing if ah and what I call the ridicule factor and the birth of the ridicule factor the way I see it it's so counter intuitive but we're talking about here is when you boil all of citing reports down and the whole way that our culture\nHas traditionally deals with deals with this although it's getting a little healthier each year um\nIf I say to somebody I saw something in the sky that I I didn't recognize I had never seen anything quite like it'd be for\nPerfectly interesting question\nPerfectly Mm rational question I'm\nNothing weird about it how is it that those words or variations on it and just the idea\nPeople see your mouth moving but they are so deeply condition that they will many people are going back out three generations will say to themselves at least\nWhat's wrong with Peter I'm does have a mental problem does he want to fool me does he want to be famous is he some kind of strange mystic um is this a way that he thinks he can get money uh my favorite ... he does he want to feel special\nNone of these responses make\nThe least bit of sense the healthy human response would be gosh\nNone of these responses make\nThe least bit of sense the healthy human response would be gosh I Wonder what it was two and a story\nHow did it happen well I'm you're talking to somebody who\nSpent years literally investigating this question and it all drives back to the summer of Nineteen forty seven\nI'm a summer profoundly important in the study of the UFO phenomena as many of your listeners know because it was that summer that the a so called modern age of UFOs burst on the scene\nWith two specific events and then countless others I'm a citing by private pilot um Kenneth Arnold in ah Washington state on June twenty fourth Nineteen forty seven\nWhich he reported um two reporters at a uh airport where he landed his private plane who were there trying to pick up details of the story of a missing plane\nAnd that story went out on the wire services and a question that was asked was to describe it and he said it was like a stone skipping over the water if you've you know done that as kids are as adults\nAnd somebody drew the equation with a saucer\nAnd then a saucer was funnier than stone and flying saucer well that's even funnier and then all week week and a half later some thing possibly two things went down during a thunderstorm some miles outside of a town in New Mexico called Roswell\nWhy there [noise] why would they be drawn to that area um any historian can tell you that in the summer of Nineteen forty seven\nUh there was only one nuclear strike force in the entire world it was the fiber ninth bombing which was stationed at the Roswell army air corps airfield and um\nAnd ... that is where history begins on this subject but that summer the news media which half the time consisted of newspapers and to a degree radio news\nBegan a ferocious campaign whether or not it was um spontaneously generated\nA or that there was some collusion or part of a greater plan um it was led by the most powerful newspapers in the country uh my focus was the New York times and you're speaking to somebody who is read\nA printed out a gun over ... repeatedly organized and uh look for patterns of every single\nArticle headlined a caption letter to the editor a editorial that the New York times has ever published on the subject of UFOs flying saucers on identified aerial disks and this is a serious newspaper however\nNinety seven percent I'm going to just grab that figure out of the era of their coverage whether it's some little paragraph tucked away on page Eighteen or a front page story\nIs condescending sarcastic I'm asking you to accept absolutely ludicrous insulting pseudo science everything from reflections of car lights on low hanging clouds\nTo a swamp gas weather formations um mass panic\nAnd dust on the pilots and I'm not\nA swamp gas weather formations a mass panic and dust on the pilots and I'm not getting 'em\nAnd they slugged away at it almost every day through that summer but quite honestly if you immerse yourself in this coverage by the end of July of Nineteen forty seven the fix was in and the American public had bought it whatever it was it wasn't that\nIt was Soviet tests of missiles it was a again ward jitters concerned about the Soviets um our testing V. two rockets a\nMass projections of anxiety but it certainly didn't represent in any way shape or form a machines of advanced origin from parts unknown\n... do you think that the government will towards with those major newspapers to make sure that they kind of a crackpot idea there anybody who thinks it's a it's an alien spaceship or anybody you automatically sort of black who said it's a crockpot\nYeah um it may have been it may have been I'm not going to jump the gun and say it\nDefinitely was however it makes sense more to the point I'm at the highest levels of our government and the Truman administration in our young intelligence community and are more established military intelligence community um\nWe\nWere concerned that it might be just that machines undetermined origin from parts unknown under intelligent control coming and going with impunity and\nI I see a rise I Can't prove this but a lot of circumstantial evidence points me to the following and I've used it as a conclusion and many talks over the years that\nA certain individual or individuals I'm\nLeft Washington I'm In early July and made ... trips or maybe staying overnight in Washington I'm Sorry in New York in Boston I ... in San Francisco\nWhere important members of the Truman administration met with senior publishers of newspapers and owners these would have been um you know the ah\nThe Internet billionaires of their day a rich white guys like William Randolph Hearst um he uh trying to remember the name of the family that owns the New York times um\nAh the Copley syndicated in Boston\nAnd sat down with\nThis key individual and said one or two things I'm of course you are aware of this crazy you know a stuff coming out of a uh originally you know the northwest and now a out of New Mexico and people reporting they're seeing these things they think they're you know marching machines or\nLook you know we're we've got enough on our plate this summer the Soviets are drawing lines hard they are going to be our next big enemy we are concerned about war they might get the bomb\nWhat we need from you it would be ... we'd consider it you know a patch Riyadh a favor um is instruct your editors to instruct you reporters\nTo keep a delight to have a little fun with the subject to build up a cultural appreciation that this isn't that we all remember what happened in Nineteen thirty eight with the Orson Welles broadcast and how that freaked out a lot of people and I'll tell you\nThis isn't that we all remember what happened in Nineteen thirty eight with your son wells broadcast and how that freaked out a lot of people and I'll tell you you know there are people in Washington that will remember this and thank you very much\nOr or\nIn certain cases especially with some of these I'm extremely wealthy and powerful individuals who were in their own way ... this was a simpler time or they may have been very self involved millionaires but um they love their country and they may have been told a version of the truth\nAnd then asked a you know the president would very much appreciate it if you would handle this subject in a kind of condescending way the last thing we need is people even thinking this is a possibility right now we're studying it you know we're doing our best to get our head wrapped around it\nThe president will remember this I think one of those two things happened\nAnd that things followed a inclined and that it was not only successful\nIt was successful beyond anybody's measure here we are um [noise]",
