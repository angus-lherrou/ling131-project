them I'm the editor of a magazine and choir and do things like that but I Am but even aside from that I just love mysteries me and I just I just think they're cool and they're fascinating and I try to go\nTo go into an open mind and I try to use science and look you know look at it from a critical thinking focal point of view\nAnd so one so partly the answer your question one thing that often happens is that if I'm traveling somewhere like ... if I'm traveling with my friends and family they just sort of know that all been looking at it goes again all\nRight and it's like they're like we're going to the ... going to go to the beach I'm like that's really cool are you there is a monster there so I'm Wondering over they're interviewing people taking photos and so that that's that's part\nOf it is I've been able to double up a lot of my travels in South America and Africa and elsewhere uh you know I I happen to be there anyway and so I turned into investigation one I can\nLove it love it do I do the same thing you know I mean\nIt just is what it is you just can't help and he is in your mind you that's what you do you you would if you were at that beach hanging out there with them you would just be you're just dying\nLiterally that I can relax a little bit the despite you know despite\nWhat my friends will tell you I can relax I can show but you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland or about ten years ago\nAnd that was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because uh there's been a series of lobsters are the have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are and they washed up there but\nUh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak fighting up there but as I was up there I came across um up a place called lake crushed and um and it's this little you know new Finland is it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake monster there and so\nAnd they actually have a like a twenty foot a metal sculpture\nThing this thing as you enter the town the town of the population is like three or four or something\n[laughter] I worked as a car I'm like I put on the break but I got a I I Can't pass\nA lake monstercom on site and you know my friends rolls her eyes like [noise] All right [laughter]\nWell it's better than stopping for the biggest world's biggest a ball of yarn or something like that right\nI'm with you [laughter] that's great okay so I'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween science I Googled that bone found\nYour article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing your author of course that you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine\nAnd um and some others out there too\nBut I saw this great article for Neal and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and saw looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the jealousy origins of Halloween\nSee this is ... I I I Want the two hundred years from now when people were researching the orders is will if when\nGoing to come up with this conversation I'll love it might make grandkids will be be all over it will be like\nNo I Want it to one of the things\nThat I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not big on the on the holidays meaning of Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween 'cause it's it's you know it it secular\nA you know people of all religions can enjoy it\nUh you know sometimes the fundamentalists guess all the the the conservative sometimes you get a little touchy about that 'cause they think it's really the the cult which is not but it's it's when it's ... basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's why I really love about Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history\nI'm basically Halloween\nA ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore\nRick these events and holidays there is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal it festival called a sigh when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about just because it was that it was so long ago and there's no the the ... ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary but it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice um and it's a time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plans are dying\nUm so it had this connection to uh to darkness but it wasn't a sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them a ... there was a very ... it was much more of an\nAn analyst point of view it wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so in wasn't scary it was like yes this is a time to you know to a store or grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world's wasn't sexually thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in though in the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day the the the uh the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also\nUm in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that uh time is porous and so what you find is that a whole would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when\nI Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and then there are there other worlds but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that would involve the Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them but there were ideas for example that um that uh for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future\nUm and there would be the ... or ...\nUh was um either dealing with like people who died the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitions about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night a projectile they would be would a way to handle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror and midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nUm and so it always or another one example is a body for Apple you know if you're not new apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition\nThat if you ... if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken and he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so those there's this really interesting blend of you know two or all coming together and past and present coming together\nOn my way man I got to write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night actually I Do it and do it at midnight right on\nThe wheel right that's right will swing [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people\nThat say Halloween oh saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it as fun I see it as a I\nI mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool Jack o' lantern that you get to make I think of fall whether I think of orange and black colors yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which is in the goblins and\nAnd it'd be fun fun things that's how I see it\nAnd it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it and the traditions out of it and and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here but what we have is a band Radford with us\nHe is an investigator and an end to all the things that were into a has coast the folks here that\nWant to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also goes hunting too so stay with his county well let's hear it's Willis ... hanging and you don't know what you might here tonight [noise]\n[noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean talking with Ben ran for then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and get say panic in gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanut characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kind of stuff\nUm but that like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that any time of the year\nYou know you don't see any creativity to go to target and put on you know a Batman mask can we make make them out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do up you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin is so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associate of course these days um although your Halloween was never really mainly a children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty\nBefore that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a cute\nKid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to\nGo back to ... and the the the early\nA Celtic version of it which were very strict and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season and darkness and snow and all that um but you know so you you have that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day\nWhich was an honor that the church a church members to gone to heaven and then also got wrapped up to a whole day was November second which bills are wrong for the phone purgatory and so there\nIn transition from an early purely pagan he um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that and then you have the the influence of the Catholic Church with all things you know sold day\nAnd and again they were the ringing a bell and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noise for such a scare where he's evil and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know could we are talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that a ... believe that a drink so and the ... leaders would where animals skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody knew they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the late Eighteen ... Seventeen hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween preparing for the dead and this again the ties back into all day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day ah the soul of the word purgatory you know they were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell the needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the the wealthy members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... sub contract the prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread and in return for paying for a for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn it of course that would lead or translate into uh the the the the uh the public and um but the\nCandle at land for the candle in it and the candle light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they would these members go out for house to house say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's\nA who's passed on um ... you know holding up this this turn up with a candle to think of this light as the the soles don't you wants to pray for them they would say yes\nAnd then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America\nUm the tournament ... sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nTo read [laughter] when when the pumpkins came in because the pumpkin associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and their associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating aspect came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn now move on [laughter] ... salt pepper um so we're candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in that like right after they eat like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean if it was interesting because it because again the sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is um that if you think about it you know again that was the ... the mom and going on this and that\nAnd then uh the the during this time of the the jitters had produced a strict social roles and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween was a time when when young girls would would would pining away and with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town\nHave three or four of the time who knows 'cause that's what they did\nUm but you know that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house will get into the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of\nTrick or treat and give us give us a little token or something you would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that would typically sort of a young man you know ... him Mr this young man's project and the the the girls and women were tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the process of those sorts of things so so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as as the as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean there were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for a little bits of bread to\nTo pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's it that's a little less a little a little outlandish for for a little too much work for these days\nSo that's when this sort of came down to treat a and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar\nAre you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally actually I have all okay and I like\nIt was it wasn't even that I like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple didn't I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it\nWas great you remember the good houses together too because there were there were years where you would get full science candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the ... which is right and it was very dark so if you if you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get in a handful\nYou're the only perimeter marathon bars that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they've they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just great harm those I haven't heard anybody mentioned those in decades oh that's\nA horrible ... you got a full on you got a phone line is you can't replace\nA wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those any more of those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to go kind of far up one hill this way money all the other way and you had your suit and that's when they had those nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time\nBut we would never say one house and all these had homemade popcorn balls they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on there were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people\nAnd then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house that there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all the research the the ah the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison ... and the reason\nThe yeah and the fact is that\nI mean that's that's there's there's almost no truth to that uh it's it's widely talked about a friend of mine Joel Best wrote a book about that um and and you know so when you actually look at at the cases where somebody who's

I found it interesting that you had said to me\nUh that people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would go well why would you want to talk to a stranger\nYou know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know it's true what do you now\nKnow that was that was that was one of the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those\nIt's basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the the Victorian era upper upper today's you know goes hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that\nI mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references in which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know you have leaders Macbeth banquet so there's there's there there there's no shortage of food and literature and history but you know typically\nGo we're typically if people you wanted to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to\nMe your your your great grandfather or your your best friend that that died recently ... and the the idea that somebody would\nGo into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that happens to be there and say Hi can you give us a fire and you don't know me but\nTell me about yourself that that's that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back to look at the the the ... that were held in in the Victorian era\nOffered an upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady's day Crumpet the tea and the and you know they try to communicate with goats and then\nYou would have the the spiritual era hum and you have people like Harry Houdini printed research the Marjorie crammed in all these spiritual if the you know came to the states and a kitten Maggie Fox and and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nAnd then you're Harry pricing his researching all that\nAnd you sort of fast forward to uh the the the ... the idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with ghosts are through white noise and fruit based on a broken radio that switches channels are and then you sort of fast forward to\nTo the more modern day ghost wonders with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that\nAnd it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and look through techniques have been tried and and you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough or spooky enough or even scary enough when you do get some sort of interaction when you are going to try to talk to spirit because\nUm it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they\nHope in ... and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and are these things go home with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a haunted house eyes last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer going ... or looking up in the sky lights I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about ... and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and James is like you know those quick provoking quip provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to and that's what they're what's that\nYou're not doing yourself when he favors thereby proclaim whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is at All right I mean um\nYou you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to a more science based uh someone's have skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAny weird you know found as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is\nWhat exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's there's a mysterious sound or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is\nIs is going on there and the question is can we tested repeatable right is it is it is found that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the go swimming you see on TV\nUh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and ... TV [laughter] reality you know in in scare quotes um and I and I've been on many of the TV\nShows as you pointed out I was a ... of them you know on both sides of the camera on this and you know and my my point of view is always you know I I don't make fun of both 'cause I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do that do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see is that go centers on TV you and not actually just ah\nAre you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country is they typically engage what's called the anomaly hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know ... or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're they're they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these reading and walk around a little ... things and then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them\nAnd they try and look for anything we're all look at this at at three oh eight PM I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claim they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and the claims are you need to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets ... pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases they don't\nThey don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see\nA ghost hundred go into a location maybe there's team of them\nAnd they'll they'll take readings for three hours or six hours whatever else and then they'll go home and analyze them the problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um paranormal abnormal you need to know what's normal\nDoes your dog each scratched tinker shed like crazy come to die for our quarter and Ninety Days supply of dynamite\nEverything we tried failed except that died of I\nPick up two bottles of super bigger fish oil get the third bottle free packed with a mega three D.

V. I. T. [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here will is wean is what's\nGoing on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he\nAlso is an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating dose and it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's let's bring him back on year then we were talking about uh how you investigate and how you first go in to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I want an here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is this picture I took a you know some there's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something\nAnd I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to thank things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you know what his photo shopped what is not photoshopped what might just be a glitch ... what might be a maybe a light reflecting off or the difference between an orbit and a piece of dust how the analyzing\nOf photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that that's a good question I have to say the the um you know I've I've probably looked at a two or three hundred photographs or over the years people have sent me I'm\nI'm a similar to recover [laughter] on the on the default recipient of of to pick up\n[laughter] many dogs in Texas but I I have to clean up for them afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I rarely encountered hoaxes hum I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the\nThe the ghost photos of them sent our our ... ... people who just photographs something weird and they yeah they're not lying and they're not ... not a poll on Obama either like\nFlew him they're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise] um and so you know I ... I go into each case um you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can and\nSo one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you are I if if someone sends me if a photograph I Can't just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know to Denver\n[laughter] research it goes photos much why not [laughter]\nBecause I haven't trademarked Willis lean and got in the world is often [laughter]\nSplit it with me that's all I ask you know as\nA no but it's um so so there's a couple of things one of them is that is I ... when when possible I Try to go to the the location or was filmed and try and figure it out so all you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which is the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nHappened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was really strange glowing orbit thing that the cross this this railings camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that they're probably [laughter] that would\nThat make that gave them credibility right it's a deputy on the court of cameras so\nThe likelihood of this being a hoax was was dropped off considerably at that point [noise]\nUm but what I ended up doing was ... I went to the story a it was a made national news and people are you all this weird thing of law\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I why went up there and investigators night I went and I went to the courthouse and looked at the camera and I talked to the deputies and interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas of what it might be\nUm and I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what her alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect going to be a hoax could be a ghost is or is there some I mean so you just basically any\nAnything that he is even remotely possible I Try and lift those and I tried to rank them in terms of what's most likely which which things can I scientifically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify 'em and you just basically go down the list and\nAnd that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important uh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise] but but when possible it's good to try and replicate it so you for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there and she said no this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well\nAgain it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and try to replicate it you know take take take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI see so ... and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that's it\nThat thing whenever that might be is just there like you said in it might be people might think they know that uh\nWell I'll give you an example of one of\nAll I was gonna say one of it is um you know if it's on the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right\nAs often the case of where you know there's there's an extra for example behind standing behind somebody a and actually I I was sent me an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there's this sort of weird goes the image or just behind her left\nUm you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to beat conclusive about it\nWithout more information but I noticed that no one else around them noticed it I mean there there are other people who are you or nearby\nAnd no one's looking into you know strange image to the left and so that suggests that they probably didn't feed at the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got ya and you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the I in some things are picked up from a certain angle and but not another angle um\nThey need and it's just you know there's some things that are seen that it just is the way the shadow is in just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked up\nThat I mean it just looks like there's no way it could be anything else but something creepy or you know we're the\nSame at this place was hunting for sure you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a TV show called the Mr request a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted placed there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know probably Seventy thousand dollar with the gear\nAnd it was all set up when the cameras and lights and a ... sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought all that stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean I was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out we were finished shooting we're going back to tell us and I said why do you think\nWhy do you think it is that that we don't we still have good quality evidence of goes\nUh I mean even to this day and again this was you know six seven years ago said you know even the the evidence of getting a better it's all these blurry or business not and he said well I think the I think the problem the basic problem is that ... that we don't have the technology to does that ghost\nWhich is building a better bank look like\nIt starts with

you know I'll give you one quick example I was in Newfoundland about ten years ago\nAnd I was there with a friend of mine were traveling around looking icebergs and part of the reason that I went there was because ah there's been a series of lobsters are the have washed up these you know mysterious\nMasses of you know sea creatures or whatever they are and they washed up there but uh so I wanted to go investigate some of that and there's also Spring Hill jak fighting up there but as I was up there I came across um up a place called lake crescent\nUm and it's this little you know ... it's beautiful it's just you know it just Craig crevices and everything and it turns out that there's there's a local lake months there and so and they actually have a like a twenty foot\nA metal

right [laughter] right I'm with you [laughter] that's great okay so\nI'm I'm before I go on you know this week I was like okay you know what I Want to talk about the origins of Halloween science I Googled that boom towns\nYour article that even written 'cause you you do a lot of writing you're not there of course that you do a lot of writing for our life science dot com Discovery News skeptical inquiry magazine and um and some others out there too\nI saw this great article from you and I was like oh my gosh here's the game you know and solid looked into your background so you were legit you weren't just somebody who was writing from somebody else's book or anything like that you actually research so\nSo tell me about the origins now we're ... we're just now learning the origins of Willis wean the jealousy\nYou actually research so so tell me about the origins now learning ... we're just learning the orange rubber Willis wean the Gallup the origins of lean\nSee this or that I I I Want a two hundred years from now when people are researching the orders is will if we and\nThey are going to come up with this conversation I'll love it might make great grandkids will be be all over it they'll be like that\nYou're one of the things I Love about about you know to to to be honest with you I'm not I'm not\nBig on the on the holidays mean your Christmas is fun blah blah but but you know to my mind the one that I really look forward to Halloween 'cause it's it's you know it it secular a you know people of all religions can enjoy it uh you know sometimes the fundamentalists\nGets all the the the conservative from time to get a little touchy about that 'cause they think it's really the the cult which is not but it's it's it's basically something that everybody can sort of jump into and that's why I really love about Halloween is it's it's more than just costumes and candy has a fascinating history I'm so basically Halloween\nA ... you know as as with most of these sorts of sort of folklore Rick these events and holidays\nThere is not just one street line back right I mean there's there's different influences that come in overtime but basically we can trace it back thousands of years to an October thirty first a Celtic or deal it festival called a sigh when [noise]\nUh and uh we don't we don't have that much information about it just because it was that it was so long ago and there is no the the ... ... records are pretty sparse fragmentary but it was basically an annual communal a meeting at the end of the year of the harvest\nAnd it was a time when of course you know it's wintertime the solstice\nUm and it's a time when I'm you know the the the snow's falling in you know plants are dying um so it had this connection to uh to darkness\nBut it wasn't sinister by modern standards mean when we ... we think we think of the darkness as being you know something faster but to them it was very it was much more of an an analyst point of view wasn't about death or evil it with the changing of the seasons\nUm and so that was so ... so to the people that were celebrating it so in what the scary it was like yes this is the time to you know to a store or grains and to you know give thanks to to to to the gods and and the the spirits and this and that [noise]\nUm and it was believed that uh that on that day that the um uh the the the separation between the world's was especially thin porous\nSo the rest of the year you know we we were in our happy little world and you know the the other creatures the other Ken [laughter] you know the the ferry folk or what have you there in the world and they leave us alone and we leave them alone but on this day the the the uh the barrier between them becomes more porous [noise]\nUm and so this is why uh the the began talking about how\nSpirits would ah would come come forth on this day and it was people were much more likely to be able to uh see spirits and they were basically all around us and it wasn't just the um it wasn't just the the idea that the the world's were porous\nUm you know the barrier between them but also\nUm in leader incarnations of Halloween it was also that a time as porous and so what you find is that a whole would later become Halloween I'm there would be a it would be basically a time when\nI Would be for a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and that there are there other worlds but it's also\nFor a time for prophecy so it was this notion that uh you know there's our world and that there are there other world but it's also the barrier between the president in our future\nAnd so ah for example in the Eighteen hundreds or there were different customs that were there were involved Halloween which are basically abandoned today people don't really talk about them\nBut there were ideas for example that the that are for example woman born a Halloween would be able to tell the future um and there would be the profit and often times the prophecy\nA was um either dealing with like people who might die the following year or oftentimes it was about marriage so if it was often times there's there's very superstitious about young women\nWho would on on Halloween Night or for example they would uh be with a white a candle in front of a mirror a and a and it was said that you that the the with a look in the mirror and midnight and they would see their future husbands reflection\nUm and so all these sorts of another one example is a body for Apple you know if you're not near the apple bobbing and there was there was a particular holiday tradition that if you cut a pie if you killed an apple in one long continuous strip unbroken\nAnd he talked it over one shoulder and it was intact when it when it landed it would spell the initials of your future husband so there were so there's this really interesting blend of you know two worlds coming together and pass me credit coming together\nOn my way man I gotta write those down and and and do this on Halloween Night [laughter] actually I Do it you know the midnight right here on my willfully\nNight that's right will swing in [laughter] well what about\nUm you may you may have your own little um I'll give you your own little outline of what to follow but I Want to know about you know trick or treating and where that came in but I Want you to use your own timeline to get that and I want to\nYou know 'cause I I get there are people\nThat say Halloween a saint saint saint ... and um you know I like I Know a lot of conservative people that that that they're cool with it you know um but um\nYou know I always see it as fun I see it as a I\nI mean if you say Halloween I immediately think a cool jak a lantern that you get to make I think of fall whether I think of orange and black colors yeah I think a fake little cartoons that we would watch like which isn't the goblins\nAnd and they're very fun fun things that's how I see it\nAnd it's terrible I think people get really deep into it and and all of a sudden they take the fun out of it in the traditions out of it in and uh I I don't know I just we wish we could just all get along so hang in there for a little bit okay we're going to have to take a break here but what we have as a banner Radford with us\nHe is an investigator and and into all the things that were into a as coastal folks here that want to learn everything um but he also you know does a lot of writing and he looked into the origins of Halloween and we're going to learn more from him about that and also\nChecks path to seven nine six four or five that's P. H. E. H. two seven nine six four or five\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast am county Willis here discussing the origins of Halloween on Willis wean talking with Ben Radford then so as you tell us about the origins of Halloween it really does have a um an interesting history\nVery rich in history um it's silly it's scary and gets they panic and gets kind of crazy I enjoy watching the\nAh television shows around the time of Halloween or that were the fun ones the little peanuts you know characters that's always fun with the great pumpkin and all that kinda stuff\nUm but I like the fun ones and and I like when people dress up you know like the vampires and the Frankenstein I like the really good scary stuff\nI don't like that sometimes it gets pretty lame and people just dress up like somebody else which to me they can you know they dress up like you know just a regular kind of normal like Superman or something like that they can do that anytime of the year\nOh you don't see any creativity to go to targeting put on you know a Batman masking make me come out of it you know\nYes agreed and and and do you know make a Jack o lantern and put a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning pumpkin is so cool I Love it love at all\nAnd and and you know make a Jack o lantern and play a real candle in there and let smell that smell of burning so cool I Love it love it all\nAbsolutely you know I mean that's that's one of the you know that that's really what's associates of course these days um although you know Halloween was never really mainly children's holiday and it really didn't become focused on kids until about Nineteen fifty before that it was I mean kids were involved but it wasn't really a kids\nIt wouldn't kid centered as it is today a it was more of a community thing again sort of if you go back to\nGo back to solve when and the the the early\nA Celtic versions of it which were very antagonistic and and again sort of dealing with the changing of the season in darkness in snow and all that [noise] um but you know so you you had that and then that sort of what happened was that\nUm that that someone got mixed in along with all saints day which was November first which was you know obviously the next day which was to honor that the church a church members to gone to heaven and then also got wrapped up to a whole whole day which is November second which\nBills are wrong for the soul in purgatory\nAnd so there was this there was it was interesting transition from an early purely pagan he um you know ritual which died out long before you know the church was was even writing about devils anything like that\nAnd then you have the the influences the Catholic Church with ... and and again they were the ringing a bell and sometimes the bills are wrong to keep away a demons and scary things could loud noises verse head to scare away the evil [noise]\nUm and that sort of transformed a little later on into the modern costumes because what what happened is\nI'm a you know because we are talking about you where the cost and you come from and one one part of it is that uh it believe that a drink so in the ... leaders would wear animal skins I'm there and sometimes the animal heads like antlers whatnot during the ceremonies\nAnd they weren't there they weren't doing it to fool anybody of course everybody knew they were but it was it was a ritual thing in terms of honoring the land and the animals that were given to them [noise]\nUm but then later on during the lead a team at least some hundreds and England was customary for the wealthy remembers in town to offer a small payment or food um to the poor during Halloween preparing for the dead and this again the ties back into all souls day because the idea was that\nUm that on that day ah the sole weren't purgatory you know there were they were basically trapped between heaven and hell they needs to be prayer prayed for\nA and so the the wealthy members of the communities would basically\nA higher out there were ... they were subcontract prayers if you will to these numbers and so these these people would go from house to house asking for what were called ... which type of bread and in return for paying for praying for those purgatory so they would they would do dances and songs and rituals\nAre going from house to house getting little tokens of of of food\nOr or coin hum and often times they would care with them how to turn it of course that would lead or translate into the [laughter] the the the uh the public and um but the\nCandle at land from the candle in it and the candles light represented the soul the person they would pray for the idea was that they were these members go out to house say you know yes will pray for if you have a member of your family who's\nA who's passed on um new you know holding up this this turn up with a candle in it think of this light as the sole too and she wants to pray for them they would say\nOn I'm with you know holding up this this turn up with a candle and I think of this light as the the full ... to ... wants to pray for them they would say yes and then of course when that came over with the Irish immigrants to to America um the turn of the sort of got lost by the wayside which is just as well if you ask me\nBreed that's\nWhen the pumpkins came in because the pumpkins associate course they're they're bigger they're they're more fun to carve and our associate with the harvest and that's that sort of how the the trick or treating aspect came along\nOh I like that yeah I agree with you turn to now move on others ... says Munch on little olive oil salt and pepper I'm so worried candy I guess I guess it all turned into candy at one point in is that like right after the ... like you were talking about\nYeah well I mean if it was interesting because again the it's sort of the things sort of parsed out along gender lines for a while because what would happen is um that if you think about it you know again that was the the mom and going on this and that\nAnd then uh the the during this time of the the genders had pretty strict social roles and so\nUm and as I mentioned earlier during Halloween by the time when when young girls would would ah would pining away with ... think of you know who which which cute boy they would marry and the next town over who probably had three or four of the time who knows\n'cause that's what they did\nUm but you know so that that's what they were doing so so ... if you think about like during this time this is when people would go from house to house in the ... the mom and get sort of gone away but the tradition of going to people's houses to knock on the door and you know sort of trick or treat and give us give us a little token or something\nYou would be inappropriate for young women to do that they wouldn't really go out alone by themselves during during that era\nSo that was typically sort of a young man's you know ... a mixture of this young man's project in the the the girls and women would tend to be more indoors and that's where you get the apple bobbing and rituals in terms of you know the process even though those sorts of things so [noise] so you know by the late Eighteen hundreds the tradition of playing pranks on Halloween was pretty well established\nAnd and that's when ah you know as as the religious aspect sort of faded away right I mean they were\nPeople were no longer you know going from house to house asking for little bits of bread to to pray for you know sold in purgatory [laughter] that's it that's a little less a little a live outlandish for for a\nLittle too much work for these days so that's when this sort of came down to treats or and even even today I mean I remember when I was a kid or not so long ago I like to say uh you know they were it was a member of you know every now I get to get a silver dollar\nOr are you sometimes you get an apple you're like really\nReally a capital okay and I like it was it wasn't even that like it was like some really tart apple was like you went out of your way to find a nasty apple didn't I didn't say that I'm like you but anyway [laughter]\nYou know well I you know I remember when we would go I'm a long time ago it was great you remember the good houses together because they were there were years where you would get full science candy bars and by the way if you came up to our house which was on a hill and it was scary and we would play that'll\nHaunted house record where you heard the ... which is right and it was very dark so if you if you risk if you were brave enough to go to our house you would get full size bars you know marathon bar and you get in a handful\nYou're the only ... I Love that I Love the marathon bars but there were all and chocolate and they they were like a foot and a half long yeah\nIn ... you're the only perimeter marathon bars that I Love the marathon bars but they were all and chocolate and they've they're like a foot and a half long yeah and they were just great they're just great harm does I I haven't heard anybody mention those in decades oh yeah that's a horrible ...\nYou got a full on you got a full one is you can't replace a wish I'd been there\nI Can't believe they don't make those anymore those are fantastic but but we were when we would go trick or treating and and we had to go kind of far up the hill this way money all the other way and you had your son that's when they had those old nasty math that you couldn't breathe or anything but at the time\nBut we would never say one house and all he had homemade popcorn balls they were delicious it was the only time we ever had on they were awesome and you know back then you could trust the people and then of course you know you hear about razor blades in apples and things like that but then there was another person's house\nThat there were a dentist and they only gave away toothbrushes like we don't want to go there you know thank you yeah trick or treat thank you [laughter]\nI should mention that because of all three search the the ah the more modern scares a and you know you mentioned the the the classic a poison candy scares and the reason the yeah and the fact is that that I mean that's that's\nEach team deserves a nice at least one adult to make unconditional commitment to them and adults understand that a child who was removed from the family\nYou know for their own struggle at times be sad an angry or may need ongoing comes families who knows the small steps can lead to accomplish that no one thought possible\nYou've got to believe in your child and yourself in the journal [noise] are you one of those who are willing to step up and provide a loving home to the vet esteem [noise] if you believe you are these contacts and the child and family services at one eighty four to three twenty six fifty\nThis message with paid for by the ... division childhood family services to replicate the family programs an air to cooperation within about a broadcaster\nDissociation and this station\nFrom the justice ... studios twenty am not Las Vegas ...

I found it interesting that you had said to me\nOn that people will go into cemeteries and they'll ask to talk to a spirit were years back people would go well why would you want to talk to a stranger you know maybe call upon your family member or somebody you know it's true what do you now\nKnow that was that was that was one of the things that I uh when I was researching my book are investigating goes to those\nIt's basically a survey of of the scientific attempts to to contact the dead I'm ranging from basically pre history a but primarily through the the the Victorian era upper upper today's you know ghost hunters and all that\nAnd what you find is that the the idea that\nI mean you know people have been talking to the dead for millennia I mean that's you know there's references or in the which of indoor and the Bible and Shakespeare you know\nYou're leaving Macbeth I mean banquet so there's there's there's there there's no shortage of go see him in literature and history but you know typically go to war or if it's typically if people wanted to talk to a ghost you'd be talking to them for a reason for example you'd be talking to\n'em your your your great grandfather or your your your best friend that that died recently um and the the idea that somebody would\nGo into like a haunted house whether the Myrtle plantation or a Wally house or you know what what have you go to a hundred location and\nTalk to some random spirit that just happens to be there and say Hi can you give us a sign you don't know me but\nTell me about yourself that that that's a that's a relatively new phenomena hum and it's it's fast and you know you go back to look at the the the answer that were held in in the Victorian era\nOffered an upper class uh places and they would have you know a lady's day Crumpet some tea and and the and you know they try to communicate with the ghosts and then\nYou would have the the spiritual era [noise] um and you had people like Harry Houdini printed research the Marjorie ... and all these spiritual is that you know came to the states and Kate McGee Fox\nAnd and and they're you know their their stuff and so\nAnd then you're Harry uprising has researching all that and then you sort of fast forward to\nUh the the the ... the idea and you know the electronic voice phenomena and the idea that you can record you communicate with goes through white noise and fruit based on a broken radio that switches channels are and then you sort of fast forward to\nWhom the more modern day goes to ... with the the TV shows and all the spin offs and goes inventors and all that\nAnd it's just fascinating when you sort of look at the history of these sorts of things and look through techniques have been tried and\nAnd you know what works and what doesn't and and how do we know\nYeah I think it's a you know it's already kind of creepy enough spooky enough or even scary enough when uh you you get some sort of interaction when you are going to try to talk to spirit because um it's it's scary when you get\nAnd you do get some sort of interaction when you are going to try to talk to spirit teachers um it's it's scary when you get somebody talking to you but\nPeople take that step further and they hope in pinch and you don't know who they're poking at ... I mean they're really trying hard to get interaction and you don't you don't know if that's going to be somebody nice or not and that these things go wrong with you you know that's where\nI grew up in a hunted how high is the last thing I wanted to go around me I prefer ... or looking up in the sky light I don't want something going home with me even though people claim that those things go home with them too\nBut you know what I mean ... if you um and you talked about ... and things like that one of my friends is archbishop James long and changes like you know folks quick provoking clip provoking you don't know who or what you're talking to\nAnd that's what they're which that\nYou're not doing yourself and he favors thereby ... whatever maybe they're\nRight you don't know what it is if it's evil or not evil or what it is it All right I mean\nUm you you talk about in your book there's different guidelines for scientifically investigating these reports how you do that scientifically\n... there's a couple of things you know one of the first thing you do is um you establish I mean I I've done I've done you know many goes investigations myself\nUm and as I said I I come to a more science based uh someone's have skeptical point of view that doesn't mean that I dismissed everything it just means that you know I'm not going to believe\nAny weird you know sound as that goes and so for the first thing that I Do when I go into a case is try to establish a water the false viable claims that is what exactly is being claimed you know if someone saying that there's\nThere's a mysterious found or laughing or something in the hallway or is there a photograph for me what what exactly is is is going on there and then the question is can we tested repeatable right is it\nIs it is the sound that comes up you know every every full moon I'm you know what's going on here and so a lot of times ah unfortunately a lot of the the go swimming you see on TV uh is is not very scientific um it it it looks exciting look dramatic you know it's all of course you know reality\nTV and ... TV [laughter] reality\n[laughter] you know in in scare quotes um and I and I've been on many of the TV shows as you pointed out I was a ... of them you know on both sides of the camera on this and you know and my my point of view is always\nYou know I I don't make fun of growth on them because I I've done goes hunting and I I've I've done a lot of that and so my my point is if you're going to do that do it right\nYou know bring science to bring good good critical thinking too so I'll give you one quick example so one problem that I often see is that go centers on TV you and and not actually just across the board is is are you in this applies even you know amateur groups across the country if they typically engage in what's called the nominally hunting\nAnd that is they're they're looking for they're sampling the environment whether it's a ... or you know you you know maps or magnetic uh frequencies water temperature drops whatever it is and they're the they're they're sampling the environment looking for something weird\nAnd they're saying okay well if we will will go here and we'll be there from you know midnight until you know until six AM and we'll take all these reading and walk around we'll try and promote goats and those sorts of things\nAnd then they get hours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we're all look at this uh\nHours and hours and hours of audio tapes and videotape and they combed through them and they try and look for anything we all look at it at three oh eight PM I Am you know we saw this thing\nAnd the problem is that oftentimes they're forgetting to investigate the original claim they're you know the first thing you need to do is when you when you talked on a witness and you you you research the history of the house and what the claims are you need to investigate those particular claims\nAnd and oftentimes that sort of gets pushed by the wayside in their eagerness to you know do this sort of sexy investigating and you know get the get the infrared cameras on we're going to walk around here and all these things\nAnd and and that that's part of part of the problem here is that is that if you're going to sample the environment there's nothing wrong with that problem is that that in almost all cases\nDon't they don't have a good grasp of of of ah of the amount of data needed to to adequately sample a location so for example you'll see\nA ghost hunter go into the location maybe there's a team of them\nAnd do you know they'll take readings for three hours or six hours whatever else and then they'll go home and analyzing the problem is that's not nearly enough time to get a good baseline right in order to know what's what's what's um

[noise]\nIt's coast to coast am county Willis here\nWill is wean is what's\nGoing on right now and we are talking with Benjamin Radford he also\nIs an investigator of mysteries and an author and one of his latest book is called investigating ghosts and it's um\nIt's very interesting book it talks about ah well let's let's bring him back on year then we were talking about uh how you investigate and how you first go in it to an area where somebody says there's these things happening and I want an here's a question\nThat I Want to know that I I really don't know and a lot of people I don't think they have any clue either but everybody tries to be cool you know um when you look at a picture of photographs\nAnd someone says this is a picture I took ... you know some\nThere's a lot of really great people out there that they really had things happening and they have great pictures of possibly something\nAnd I love that I mean we all want that but then there are some people out there that want to thank things\nSo when you do see a picture how do you know what his photo shopped what is not photoshopped what might just be a glitch ... what might be a maybe a light reflecting off or the difference between an orbit and a piece of dust how the analyzing\nOf photos tell us about that\nYeah I Know that that's a good question I have to say that that um you know I've I've probably looked at\nTwo or three hundred photographs or over the years that people have sent me I'm I'm a same with the triple Garber on the on the default recipient of of triple Garber\nPhotos many dogs in Texas but I I have to clean up afterwards\nAnd I I have to say that I've rarely encountered hoaxes um I have on occasion but I Would say probably Seventy to eighty percent of the the the goes photos of them sent our our ... by\nFear people who just photographs something weird and they yeah they're not lying there not too much not point Obama either like hey can I call them\nThey're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me\nYeah they're not lying there not a hoax and that's not try pulling over on me they're like hey can I flew him they're just like hey this is weird you know can you can you help me figure this out [noise] um and so you know I ... I go into each case um you know trying to figure it out and to help them as best I can\nAnd so one of the things that I encourage them to do and I I Can't always do this myself because you are I if if someone sends me if a photograph I Can't just drop what I'm doing fly off to you know to Denver\n[laughter] research it goes photos much why not [laughter]\nBecause I haven't trademark Willis lean and gotten rid of that [laughter]\nSplit it with me that's all I\nKnow but it's um [noise] so so there's a couple of things one of them is that is I ... went one possible I tried to go to the the location where it was filmed and\nTry and figure it out so all you mentioned earlier um one case that I'm known for which the Santa Fe courthouse coast case\nHappened about I don't know maybe ten years or so ago and it was in in Santa Fe New Mexico the capital or which is about an hour north of here\nAnd it was a video taken outside of a a courthouse and it was a really strange glowing orb thing that the cross this this railings camera [noise] um\nAnd it was you know it was it was seen by deputy uh so you know that they're probably [laughter]\nThat would that make that gave them credibility right it's a deputy on the court now the cameras so the likelihood\nOf this being a hoax was was dropped off considerably at that point\nUm but what I ended up doing was ... I went to him I said the story a it was made national news and people are you all this weird thing of law\nAnd because I live in the state again I'm about an hour away I why went up there and investigators night I went and then I went to the courthouse and looked at the camera and I talk to the deputies interviewed people\nAnd I had some ideas about what might be um\nAnd I did some experiments I eventually you solve the case and figured out what it was and so part of the answer is you you look at the the the the video or the photograph and you try to figure out what her alternative explanations right so I\nUsually I make a list of three four or five different things you know could be could be an insect could be a hoax could be a ghost is there is there are some I mean so you just basically any anything that he is even remotely possible I Try and lift those\nAnd I tried to rank them in terms of what's most likely which which things can I scientifically test which things can actually you know investigating falsify 'em and you just basically you'd go down the list and and that's that's one of the things I Do so so one key thing that the important\nUh and it's not always possible because sometimes you know it's\nThe photograph is you know Thirty years old and it was taken in you know in in Poland and you know who knows where the hell that came from [noise]\nBut but when possible it's good to try and replicated so ... for example a woman sent me a photograph that she took in a hotel in Deadwood\nAnd I said you know a ... are you still there should know this was a couple of years back I knew it was a sort of image does he she saw in a room in the mirror and I said well\nAgain it's it would be I could I could be more help if this was a recent photograph not just a couple of years back in different states but I said you know if you if you do go back there if you were still there go back and try to replicate it you know take take take the photograph\nAt the same place ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be\nIt's a ideally at the same time of day um and see if you see if there's something in the background that that you know might might be might be mistaken for a ... a an image of a face or something\nI see so and I get that I get that and but you know I guess that that thing whatever that might be is just there like you said in it might be people might think they know that uh\nWell I'll give you an example of what\nI was gonna say one of it is um you know if it's from the one question comes up as the other people see it right and so this is right\nIs often the case of where you know there's there's an extra for example behind Sandy behind somebody a and actually I I was sent to an example this a couple of months back and they said oh this is the weirdest thing you know my cousins here and there was this there was this sort of weird goes the image\nOr we just behind her left um you what do you think it is I said well again I I wasn't there it's kind of ... you know it's hard to be conclusive about it without\nMore information but I noticed that no one else\nAround them noticed it I mean there there are other people who were nearby and no one is looking into you know strange image to the left and so that suggests that they probably didn't see the time and it may or may not be a camera artifact\nI got ya I got ya and you know it's it's hard because some things are picked up on camera that we don't see what the I in some things are picked up from a certain angle and but not another angle\nUm they just you know there's some things that are seen that it just is the way the shadow is in just that second you know you can take something out but then there's some really crazy things that are picked up\nThat mess I mean it just looks like there's no way it could be anything else\nBut something creepy or\nYou know we're the same at this place was hunting for sure you talk about uh goes hunting equipment to man has it changed a lot so what works what doesn't work\nAnd and by the way I think in the future we're going to have a whole lot of different types of devices that will measure some of the things we're looking to measure that that we can't measure right now it's all a new science you know\nWell yeah I mean you know one of the interesting aspects of of ghost investigation is um is the uh you know a ... for example I was I was doing a TV show called the mystery quest a while back and I was there with them a ghost hunters and um the flu is out to California to investigate a haunted place there and\nAnd they they brought in all this all these are the ghost during the equipment and just you know there's cameras and ... there's always like you know probably Seventy thousand dollar with the gear and\nIt was all set up when the cameras and lights and our and all that sort of thing and and I talked to one of the guys who brought stuff a little bit later I said you know I'm just curious and we weren't on camera I mean I ... this was in like a gotcha moment we're just hanging out we were finished shooting we're going back to tell us and I said why do you think", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas",
