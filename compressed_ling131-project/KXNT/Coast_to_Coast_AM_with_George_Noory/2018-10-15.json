tonight is the coast to coast AM Studios right here in Los Angeles California standing in on this beautiful Sunday evening I Am your host Jimmy church and tonight my guests\nAnd for that singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet\nAnd everyone on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you\nDon't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly leveled and rock pointing exactly true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years allegedly\nAnd yet we know nothing about it a few short decades after Cleopatra's rain has pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read ... nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they traveled to Cairo and they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that\nYou know and the answer air quotes\nWe don't know you know but it's\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert Duvall\nAnd that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up and and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off um and and then I said I have to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I\nStarted a you know communicating and I and I met a Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shock a few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website\nAnd we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program and you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the paper section everything listed in the rope a newest first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert Duvall and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the the snakes and polished that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\n[laughter] yeah well you know this is a this goes back to Orion mystery so I you know while I was reading things I hadn't met the two gentlemen yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I talked to myself if if an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and one or two align them with a three belt starts off Iran\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it causes believe that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three with him you know\nAnd so I looked at the statue I started looking at the statue of he looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I Am so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal if that statue\nUm I notice it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia it gave me the or the book the that they just had coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by\nThe way it is yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section is developing a you know something that he knows the dream Steeler\nWhich is you know in front of the cause of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically lots of things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about the things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it um as far as we know before\nIf there was a ... then it ... it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember the statue I remember the lying is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or\nAt the um I think it was cosmic origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in less than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and\nWe uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about why\nIs it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight you know why is it that the and one of the games are my two in general but you had the great pyramid the grades things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything [laughter] he'd love to go to tell their story and not only that but taxes in in accounting and seasons everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the great things in the great pyramid why is it missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy on I mean you know the one answer you could give us that maybe we just we haven't found the records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with this things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the kind of proof that they won\nAn inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have\nAnd hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something that leads to things um\nThe pyramids we um you know when you are next so that when you buy the great pyramid there's up to them from the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years\nAfter a you know who fool key ops was alive and if you walk into that to him to is actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in\nIn the two um it's called uh the whole rise of coup food and next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid so they called at cafe is great and who was it was called their whole lives of Google\nAnd so this was a priest that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou bring to the pyramid yeah you wouldn't expect and like I said and owner's manual we don't have right but there isn't even a general reference to two points in the direction\nAnd forget about the other ... about how was builder who built into the year was build you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that if we can do all the way\nBecause um you know ... century but see now this was in during personal rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what it is the writing the way he described it raises more questions than answers [noise]\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the park too and then the pyramid was starting to Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to box but\nYou would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's got to\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things we also have the same issues and if there was a for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yet\nThe world the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of the dream still are between the part of the things that he has to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh enter is a there is a small\nReference to pray but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that he definitely does not say that you built it\nUm and so that's the drinks are like the image towards the ... all the other hand is very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that when Cooper can't cook what actually ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same at the ... the Greek name kudos to Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the guy says Perry unequivocally what came to the park told his things already existed in fact it was broken you repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid others queen Inuit so\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast damn our nearest you'd be church or ... minute said is ... and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nBeing much more emotionally loaded on June ...\n\nTake unlimited Katie's morning noon or night you can always know how your heart is doing cardio Mobil much peace of mind in your pocket for only Ninety nine dollars\n... visit guardian dot com K. A. R. D. I. A. dot com\n[noise]\n\n[noise] [noise]\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I'm you're assuming church it's the great pyramid all might be more we get to the great pyramid\nOr ... minute said Sunday and my new uh we were talking about the inventories tell and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we started to move forward and in the dream still up\nA tent most for says mentions and in illustrates two things says there and desert Fox just tweeted\nIs there a second ... thinks\nWell there's two ... says there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second Spanx\nIf a great question um uh so that was for that was Robert Duvall um who is interpreting the second things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut ah and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question that's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double edits things\nAre and that double that it seems is in the underworld and of course he's a is a ... you know a cemetery and I don't know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by things\nAnd these the pictures are ... you know they're on mistake of all so so the opposite of questions specific of course it hasn't been found there is there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAn actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build off so they're they're heavily was a physical things are on the other side of the Nile but\nThat sounds a let's say west of a conference pyramid it's possible\nThe\n... you had mentioned that a coup food shops\nSaid that he repaired this beings but builds agreed pyramid\nThere are others that have interpreted the inventory Stella is saying that he was just a repair guy right and then he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why the discrepancy\nYeah ah let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as he had of course Egypt colleges most Egypt causes do not accept the inventories the law has a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter there's arguments so we're actually seeing is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but just to be fair to both sides um so to your question\nUm ... the ah you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text\nAnd on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egyptian means to read it means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the comes the combination is bad for him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a a is a is a strip of text where you know the trivia building has mentioned and yeah the verb that this is not further\nA qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuilt\nUm is that a hundred percent poof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the ... of ... that was found in ... in the red sea\nYou know they're saying well you okay this is the hardest talks about to a store and being ... a ship to he's a um but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was a amazing interview you and the other day he made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was built is that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour I took ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you're back so later so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their own mind\nAbout it and there was a quite a bit of relatives or a you know pyramid was dealing with uh also when the gays applied so why would there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes yes there is a\nA reference to a head Knutson um Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who's the Newton so she was supposedly is clean and you build a pyramid for her\nMost of the three ah of the three uh queen ... that are on the east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but in the human stories though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting just because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a print says so again Robert shock and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit proof that gee I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think the poop shows that she was a princess\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then deal you know there's mentions of ISIS and hop or a an old Cyrus other Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt colleges reject this though because they are saying you know if this were in ... story or at the time of coup who he's\nGot a you know as as an aside as we're not yet a work being worship there weren't not official states sanctions a deities and we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the votes or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nThere's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling may don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same man's with the same pair right and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be justice allegation is even\nYou know more complex yeah they're not and they're the stone work is is is just awful\nYeah well that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know walked off there still owns\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just that common that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality of you know there are smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the core yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to or what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we have been told over and over again\nAnd it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is one of the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing\nUm and and what I like about it is that it was not invasive you didn't have to drill old she didn't have to you know like uh uh the early explorers they used dynamite sticks to blow themselves into these monuments which was awful\nThis flu season one ... can make a world of difference so you can protect

what you're asking\nOr no I'm asking are the Howard graphics that are written all the ... and Egypt on a pair of the civil war and go back with the all the same hieroglyphics that are found on the euro is in Mexico and central and South America\nAh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so yeah there are different ... there are different ... and it's interesting you I've seen this question because you are\nYou are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the era lipic inscriptions in Quebec you can't be in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there and um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist and I don't have any fancy degrees after my name on it but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at going back to be but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H on the belt\nThat looks very similar to the age blocks in ... who are are they related I don't know\nRight there are some astrological signs in do back leads happy are they are they representing the zodiac uh that uh we're in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that\nAre they the same I don't know but I'm going back ... being that old certainly is indicating that they were the first is the oldest is it the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she liked the I call it their armies H on the bells and then when it looks like but did that age that age is repeated a\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to the Chevy or end its regarding the civil that you mentioned to me there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I've probably might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nDon't know we'll do it right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make\nGo Beckley happy and it just got away from me very it was right there but it just disappeared\nNow I'll mention it later on in the show thank you very no problem like sure I'll absolutely\nAnd uh the phone lines Manu I expected this completely jammed up let's get one more call on all of the ... let's go to let's go\nLet's go to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen and great show guinea and now new\nI guess I have a two part question than I'd like to know if he um\nHad looked at any of the highways such as that but the highways of any age and I and I'm also I think that might be the one that deals with the astounding medical knowledge that they have that if if I'm correct on that particular one\nThe second part and I'll listen over there and\nIs whether he and and and Rob it and and shock ... had can sit at some of the um the African and African American scholars who studied the net net net to add\nA which is the name of the the language which is is is still out of the ... that to a phrase itself deals with the sacred and whether he looked at people who call themselves a huge cabinet for\nInstead of Egypt and you know before they\nDid Greeks came in and consider themselves at the Kennedy colleges cabinet is where we got word from foot chemistry and also um the what you call thing\nWas that was the word that degree Scott came up with and to me [noise] what they define with the little is not what it is and the African Americans got Liz that I'm thinking of they call it a little odd that arise and so they use that time to renew old saw\nOh sad if you follow him a question and I'll listen over the air\nThank you bye And great okay three questions in my new I'm going to get to them but don't you just goes to show you the the extent of knowledge here with the coast audience a they don't play around on the first\nQuestion um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but the the one that I have looked up more specifically regarding medical\nInformation is the ... century actually in my\nBook um because on the reverse of the eagles PR piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's fixed Egypt colleges and I think um I found a solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this was in the ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about it for ... hours that's I think over sixty foot long ah it describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and reaches back a most likely a probably to him or tips time so um yeah there were there were very skilled positions of the ancient Egyptians I'm\nBarred damage and which was the name of Egypt of course kind of a group that's\nAn excellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand\nOriginally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture and that script was mostly fanatic um and the evidence from that comes from children you Jay a king scorpions and that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt uh probably from Bhutto\nAnd move towards a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably as Amy uh with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big Charles so it was picked up ...\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a ritually Africa and maybe you don't ... hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south in that\nAnd she brought up another really good point before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds it was the Greeks adapting uh the etymology of chemistry coming from candidate\nRight yes ... issue I think she mentioned is getting so uh my uh we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think it was we were I think it was the lioness and her name was make eat and by the way that's also probably an African of Africa or did you\nJust take a break right here coast to coast a camp it's\nAll Great Pyramid all Egypt all night long\nOr get tonight my new saves on day his paper is right there click on his website a coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us\n[noise] to find\nOut more about tonight's gifts to log on to go to ... am dot com [noise]\n\nEven in a in the meantime\nIf you answered yes to any of these questions Arizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university offered over one hundred and fifty highly rain degree programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree as he went on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled class the one line except most transfer credits for information live ... three five sidelined setting\nLearned for yourself fly here was ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learn to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line tax live two three five five when south and that's how the eat two three five five one second\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess ... news tapes either they were talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula in his white paper they published last week and how to locate them and I want to say really quick minute that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now\nAnd you can follow me on Twitter at a ... church radio and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither of for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a\nA page three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurement of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that does coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to haven't\nHaven't yes um I haven't worked I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where the math of the of the great pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nI have I have one piece of information that might be interesting to this um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is Louisa Shakespeare expert and he has an evil\nTo connect uh the uh the title page of the sonnet Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is ever write a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinates that Alan just discovered\nA fall right next to the ... which is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have him on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd it is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sonnets with a Shakespeare and his work Allen greens work at deciphering that page and what he's revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it's it's absolutely incredible and we'll have Marcos next month\nOkay so now as the the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's on page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report ...\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show possibly six to eight additional chambers where\nHave been told there are none\nFive right and so um you know when we talked about a um a gun thing you're Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring a found is when you get to guns and brings door\nJust before the the the floor off of the of the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression\nAnd the way he isn't trip and one of the two ways he interpreted that is there must be a space that allow that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing\nThere is a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six real quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth\nUm and and then that let's go and so you know so there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been detected by ... again\nNow the row mutts or let's let's get to this first second in the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and ah it it's going up words every body of one of those seven\nA and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction that have a different sides in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as a show going all the way to the surface and that's incorrect so I just use this illustration is is an old illustration um so that it that particular shafted not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of forty fifth in in terms of the surface\nAnd um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words there is a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space\nAnd designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses\nNo you just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which uh did help them find this ... this new chamber above the grand gallery\nYou describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw a new detectors being placed um I at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the green chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed as the scanning\nNow for the audience tell them what to do on detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights with these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when a cosmic radiation hit the atmosphere of particle called them you on has created enemy on is a negatively charged like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier\nAh didn't electron but it can pop through solid matter if it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray the pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it show and then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because the ... will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for then those viewers will arrive more rapidly and they ... and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the ... the chambers that you were proposing in the upper half of the pyramid\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifact role and I think they using this angle to confirm that the big void is real\nBut it is possible to your point that in that in that particular field of scan that yes that that could be some some in the lower ones maybe a you know on the graphic if we go back\nIn a joke in

a while was telling me about this I think uh you can there's you can't stand in there it's maybe six foot deep I'm but I'm not sure it goes anywhere I from my understanding is it's basically a blind pouch but\nUm but you know maybe there's some maybe there is a a hatch hiding somewhere but I don't know about that\nUm I can tell you that the uh you know the ... um they have a ... of course they have an extensive labyrinth charted under this thing's a and this was published in the thirties by a a chronic a person that was chronicling there was a crucial\nAnd she has a chart that shows all of that but you know to my knowledge there is no physical proof of it\nUm there is a a there's another blind pouch in the back of the ...\nBy um you know by early researchers that were basically trying to force themselves are into this things and looking for chambers and then you know the one that you just mentioned of course we know from seismic analysis that there are ... the our space is under this beings\nAnd one of those spaces specifically which is what Robert shock or a was studying uh years ago um is has a regular uh has corners and has seems to have a man made sort of features and we think that um that might be something that's of interest\nYou know he did the seismic research there and the both of you are looking to go back a woods another research expedition to hopefully drilled right\nYeah yeah first well what we\nAre what we would like to do first is to map this again with a you know a little bit more advanced a size Margaret fee and maybe electric or conductivity studies and to really get a very detailed look especially the depth Jimmy that was the problem or you know if you if you remember there was a Japanese Group that came in eighty seven\nAnd ... and did exactly the same experiment and they saw that space about two meters\nA deep and uh and and then Roberts ah you know did his studies ... a couple of years later\nAnd Robert is estimating that this phase is five meters deep so we have a little bit of a deficit problem and then of course you know that's I of Boston marketing or drilled in that area\nBut we think that they missed it uh and I mean they are they the the drill angle was too shallow and they were too far away from where we think the chamber is so they didn't really uh you know they didn't really use a good map\nTo guide them in of course they had other reasons why they were drilling so what we want you to do is you know just like a you know just like a radiologist you know the first one to do a non evasive study and really finding out the space\nAnd we'll be having a good idea where it is then with permission of course then work try a small probe into that space and see what's at and\nHow amazing would it be to finally located that hall of records that you know Edgar Casey has talked about there's this this this rumor has been going around yea for quite a while Lew would just be great to finally put to bed wouldn't\nOh absolutely we think that if we think there's a possibility that this chamber is filled with water and in fact when I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago um I was standing in front of the valley temple and thinks temple and there was a little depression and it's wet\nUm you can just you can just see that the water coming up and if if that is groundwater than it is in that chamber\nAnd so you know if if let's say if we find a chamber or the very first thing we have to do is to a very slowly and meticulously drained a water out and rescue\nWhatever it might be inside um you know sufficient enough itself becomes a very difficult project but it's doable Robert things it's a it's doable you just have to do it really slowly\nSpeaking of the things that came in on twin and this is from Baldwin is uh on Twitter and I have heard that things may have been a woman's face and then it was changed and that is why it's head is too small for its body\nYes well if we think\nWe think it was a female lie and so that part is partially we agree with that yes I don't think it was a person's head so um but we think that was a lie and is there before and the head of the line as was weak carved into a what

going to Mars\nAre the odds that there is in ... I I Know somebody recently published an article saying that there may not be intelligent life out there but I think I think there is it's a very likely and especially the physics of of a of the universe you know the holographic universe I don't know if people are following this\nBut it you know this one way that you can explain everything as a projection and if that's the case\nA dentist like Robert Duvall proposed in costs big oil is one way you can explain some of these contacts is it may be a message that gets broadcasts across the universe through you know through um ah through a quantum field\nAnd that message ends up on our end somehow it causes someone to do something that they otherwise wouldn't have like you know design a fear of it\nUm I think it's possible I I think it's on the table I'm not going to close my mind to it is but we have to have some proof I I I I mean I'm I'm not going to embrace a theory like that until I see some solid proof of it but I think it's on the table\nLet's go to the international line round Robin Vancouver Rob really quick before we hit the brake what do you have for my new\nAre absolute on her speech you guys really critically a notion struck me when you talked about structured space lose a look you're making ... a couple of quick jumps and laundered\nLooking at the idea of a Greek scare the architects roller ... super big jump starting to turn players are forming old knowledge building big garbage structures\nOr who's to say I mean you really I mean do you remember I guess people assume that the the ... the ah periods

Rob go look at a news research paper on his website and and read through it to ... lead the conclusions are that my news presenting in this paper my new we mentioned already six to eight and boy could there be more\nSo I I have to you know I've been a neat I have to mention shop here will do so he of course proposed an internal\nYears ago um I think it was Eighteen years ago with Bob Brier they published a book\nAnd he proposed this these on logistics base is basically to get the stones up the pyramid and the scale from last year didn't show it but I think the theory is that I think it's possible that the scandals that sensitive enough to detect those spaces\nAnd then of course I'm proposing that this that there are spaces that are not necessarily logistic I'm seeing that goofy theological and drop your dealt with probably disagree with me\nOr you know if you have to pay for a but he still thinks it's possible that there are logistical spaces in it but you know beat out as it may so we agree there are probably spaces up there and um I just want to ask you a quick uh because\nThe pyramid of cool too it's it's it's hot spaces inside researchers in the sixties went to Congress pyramid because they thought it can how can it be that we have all these spaces inside you know corporate pyramid buddy ... pyramid all we have is bills only chamber\nWell let me jump in I've

to recommend an author to you a merry I'm a David roles so he's a he's really done some excellent work on a ... a basically tracing biblical stories back to Egypt\nUm and so you may find some answers or you know with him so I think he's producing a television series and he's with books about it um those are great documentary a couple of years ago by I think in the holy if I remember this correctly\nUm but yeah I think it's an interesting subject I think uh I think the uh the early ... um what they were in Egypt um I think\nUh there is for specially Joseph I'm that's what the role is describing Joseph real figure and a live in a in a in a place called a virus which is in the delta\nAnd had a palace and was that was basically a A N tuned in a pyramid and he was such an important

that looks like a ... a like a small it's like a fish tell\n'em what on I I'm not sure that was a surgeon's tool but of course we don't know um it was found in the I think it was in the northern ... a shaft of the queen chamber by ah Wayne ...

I think because there is obviously I'm proposing\nUptick ten chambers I was thinking well what if it's the logical what could that be and I think the answer is the end that so in the ... a day or the ... was known for the center of the worship of denying major God's this kind of like the pantheon of of the ancient Egyptians\nAnd I think ah these chambers are dedicated to each one of these deities\nAnd and the one that's dedicated to sauce is the one that is the crucial chamber or wherever we may find the kind of things that you just mentioned are but I'm suspecting there could be piracy both in their uh with inscriptions\nI'm so that would be very exciting if that if what if that were ever to be found a but I think it's along the lines of that and if it's a logistical then I'm all I think I'm with John P o die think this is still on the table that there may have been spaces there that\nFolks of workers to pull up the stones or to the top it's possible\nUm and we'll just have to wait for the next scan I think the next ... will give us some new information\nNow I Am heard some rumors minute that they have already gotten the inside of the new chamber above the grand gallery and have removed items from there and they will be on display when the new grand museum opens next month\nYeah I I I'm not I happened to those rumors but um I Am a I wouldn't be all I wouldn't be completely surprised let's put it that way\nIt would certainly help the tourism I mean it indoors or less right\nWhich has dropped off I Am heard you know you just got back from Egypt I haven't heard\nThat have been going to Egypt for decades and that you can as a tourist because ... years past it was crowded all the buses were there\nYou had to wait in line and there was a you know thousands of people on the ... the black but today you can burn truly be the only person there\nYeah that I had there was a couple of days when I felt like that to me I I'm you know it was not\nThere were there are parts of think he's up blood toll where I was the only person walking around besides the guards and the camel riders\nSo yeah tourism has been down and they um you know they want to build a new museum and uh and of course they have to if they discover something they are the are going to show it to the world so that people come and look at it I that's\nWhy I'm hopeful that if they have something that they haven't shown us yet that we'll we'll find out about\nThis uh this is from Twitter this is from David I Love this question actually did the Nazis research ... areas as depicted in the raiders of the Lost Ark\n[laughter] ah that's a good question is are great questions or green questioned question um\n[noise] you know I I I don't know I don't know for sure I Know that Germans this is before before Nazi Germany\nUm there there was of course German activity on that he's a plot so there was actually a great American German a collaboration on the ... uh George rising from Harvard and uh and how much younger from a from the German a fun life sick\nAnd they were excavating them stop us in Iraq but this was more Nineteen you know ten Nineteen twelve and ... into the twenties and then when a Nazi Germany came about uh some of this was halted and there was a big break\n'em but specifically Nazi Germans what they did in Egypt I I don't think I can comment because I don't know\nLet's go to a geo out east in the Bronx Joe you're next on goes\nHow ya doin' Jimmy do your job than I Am\n[laughter] I'm a new Hawaii good thank you\nGood um yeah I wanted to ask you are in the case of the great pyramid is there any evidence that they're earning any tunnels underground passage ways that would connect the great pyramid to other pyramids in the vicinity\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experienced it puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access to radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone\nOr anywhere [noise]\n[noise] hey Sean Spicer and every mid term election since the civil war the president's party is locked an average of thirty two seats in the house of representatives and two in the Senate We're in for what will be a wild political season and there's going to be plenty to discuss and debate and dissect\nShe'll be sure to download my new podcast everything's gonna be alright beginning in October ... and I was an hour long weekly political tide gas covering the very latest news is across the country and we provide listeners with unique inside you can't get anywhere else everything's going to be All right and subscribe and download today on radio dot com and I turn\nDown the justice a hard ... studios G.

I see the south side yes um there is\nA ... or so Robert scan did show on both sides if I remember correctly a there were spaces under under the flanks of the things which were extending backwards yes\nUm and ah\nI mean I have no ... I don't know you know if when you when a antiquities goes and investigate those things that they don't publish the data you know there's no way for me to know what they found\nUm you know so your guess is as good as mine but I Am based on a base on to the chamber under the left part that we think exists and we think it's a manmade chamber I Am pretty sure that's not a blind chamber I think that chamber may just be the entry hall to something that goes further back\nYou know um and so yeah I Am with you I think uh I think uh there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't\nAnd so yeah I Am with you I think uh I think that there's more more than than we know and maybe they know it and they haven't published it\nJ widen or ... told me that he was down in that very same area\nAnd he's walking around he was alone and there was nobody around him so he goes to the back of the things in the south side by the tail and he looks down on the ground and he sees what he thinks is a piece of wood covered with dirt\nYeah so he he leads over grabs the wood picks it up and it's a a piece of plywood and he'd lifted up and looked and it was an entry way it was a tunnel going straight down and as he was looking into the whole\nA guard came up and yelled at him he dropped the wood and he was escorted out of there yeah and he's a Jimmy I'm here to tell you I no matter what I ... personally lifted up a piece of wood and looked into a tunnel underneath the south side\nOf the rear flanked by the scale of this things and he shot himself but yet they'll say that it doesn't exist but he saw it with his own eyes\nYeah I I don't have any doubts about uh the ... the I think that there is there's there are spaces on the things the main question is does it go anywhere or there's just a blind LBJ that's the main question\nWell you brought up something else too about I'm Andrew Collins now his\nHis that is one of the craziest videos I've ever seen I mean ... and his nerve wracking and if you've got claustrophobia in any way you watch that video and you almost can't get through it\nBut he did find a tunnel a that started up in the north west corner where the bird uh two was but and he finds a hole in the back of one of the tunes are for these birds that were there\nAnd it it it turned out to be hundreds and hundreds of feet long that stretched out and appeared to continue underneath the pyramid complex there wasn't supposed to be anything there then ... denied that there were any tunnels there\nLater went on to his own expedition and film crew and went into the tunnel complex which again wasn't supposed to exist but it does\nBut there's also a potential\nPathway from the site or from the uh the oath Irish shaft\nUm you know that's I I don't know if it was ever explored but I Know Robert was down there Hamas was down there filming and it was actually a documentary years ago\nI'm In you know he was really excited about the shaft um of course Egypt poses are telling us that these are you know late period shops and these are not from they don't get to the old kingdom\nUm but you know I'm not so sure it might be that the upper ... I'm Talking about the specifically I'm Talking about the oath Irish of it's possible that the upper two layers are laid kingdom but the the\nLower level is much older we we don't really I don't think we know for sure and it may could act um but yeah without a probing um nowadays we have the technology to probe very small spaces um but yeah until we get the data we just don't know\nYeah you're talking about the two of us iris\nYeah the to write the access is on the south side of the ... of ... causeway uh and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one\nPlay a and then that's how you and then you go under it and then uh it's three layers or or three levels rather and the lowest one is the one where you have to start off our cars submerged in water and the surrounding dot the base and that sort of the shape of the era glove\nFor house I'm a and a and you know it had this conflict goes inside and ended the four pillars around and it was fascinating\nUm you know this ah some the symbolism of it but the dating of it I I'm I'm a I'm a little bit doubtful about the official story\nWell he went down almost a hundred feet and the and the pillars that were surrounding the area where there is our topic is again underwater or those four pillars had fallen over but it was something that was also supposed to exist on the ... so and there was\nThat's right and so any inventories the ... you know we talked about it earlier there are so Robert and I think that the uh the the the myth dimension of the house of Cyrus\nOr on the inventory steal it actually may be referring to through that old style is Irish shop we think it's possible that it's referring to that\nOr Campbell's too now my cleaner is saying that Congress to them is a late period tune belonging to\nA no official called um ... cop or something like that can't remember the name but again this is the same issue you know how do we know for sure that that wasn't an older to him and then it was being intruded on\nAnd do we think we know\nThe ... before we had to the break at how much do you think is still love to be discovered um the ... there's an awful lot of sand there\nYeah but well my my favorite place to look at it and and of\nCourse Robert Robert favorite place to look would be a besides the you know ah besides the left paw is in front of the two temples if we could dig deep in front of the temple is you know where people nowadays uh watch the light show\nA there could be the actual entry to this passage\nThat we think is under the things that could be in front of the things temple and then the other thing is we I predict innate mentors the paper we're predicting\nThat there may have been also a temple or east of the valley temple and that it was dedicated to Cyrus and that would be also underground so that would be one of my favorite places and then you mentioned is things on the other side is there's things on the west side\nYou know of course if that's a great place to look a is there another sings maybe those three places will be my favorite places to go\nWhen you look at when I find the most intriguing about the ... of course everything facing west in Beijing the Nile uh there's there's a lot there and then for reasons with the causeway and the entrances and so forth but\nWhen you look at the original survey maps that were done in the Eighteen hundreds of the gays applied to there is an awful lot a that is ... ... the uh the pyramid complex facing a west in northwest there's a lot there and\nUh not only were the tunnels represented all the way back into the uh early Eighteen hundreds but there is a construction then is represented in those ... original survey maps there really hasn't been explored sense\nYeah yeah that's right that's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be explored because there are military zones or you know for example the\nThat's right there there there are some places in Egypt that cannot be export because there are military zones or you know for example the the northern a pyramid of why it are we on a you know this is an incredible amazing place\nA with a huge trends at this overall sort coffers placement\nUm but there's nothing going on since the sixties because it's a military zone so yeah I mean to your point in the in the west field way out and I do notice for a fact I don't know if this is a military zone right now but you know some areas are basically off limits and yet those secrets hiding under the fence

you\nKnow and Christopher done and others have talked about uh the the pyramid being a machine and possibly a generator powering energy that is the case Larry what would they have used it for\n... to ... to provide a labor free [laughter]\nEnergy yeah you know what and Larry thank you for the phone call my new that's exactly what a Christopher done\nUh as I said to me last week while he's talked about it for years of course I'm wasn't a big revelation with me but that it was energy for the for the people of Cairo in Egypt\nYeah you know you know what I really love about Christopher done this that he\nHe looks at the observations and he puts it into a model that is a completely uncovered by prejudices and biases he just fits all the observations into a model and that is he you know if I if I were doing the investigation he'd be the first call\nTo have him on board um\nYou know so I yeah I he's amazing I absolutely I I Love the interview and I've read has worked before and very

singular perfect present that's all wrapped up in a boat for this planet\nAnd every one on it it's the great pyramid of Egypt you don't have to look any further it is the gift that keeps on giving ... the great pyramid\nIs forty two stories tall it sits on over Thirteen acres of perfectly level rock pointing exactly true north south east and west and\n... acres of perfectly level rock pointing exactly at true north south east and west and it's been looking at us for almost five thousand years\nAllegedly and yet we know nothing about it\nA few short decades after Cleopatra's rain as pharaoh any knowledge of the great pyramid and Egyptian history was forgotten and it seemed that everything just died with her\nNobody knew how to read I Howard lipsticks nobody knew how to speak the language or to be honest they didn't know anything about anything\nAnd it all happen virtually overnight travelers explorers they would travel to Cairo\nAnd they look across the Nile and say you know I'm I'm using air quotes here right wow that's amazing what is that you know and the answer air quotes\nYeah this is a you know this is one of those things you look back and it's just incredible sometimes you just you know you you are you take a moment and use you asked yourself how did I get here but it basically you know I I was just like anyone else watching\nHistory Channel Discovery Channel and you know off and on about Egypt and it was interesting but it wasn't really such a you know it wasn't really a ... and focus\nAnd then a ... years ago I um I think somebody gave me the wind mystery by Robert Duvall and that changed quite a bit for me that was just an amazing story um you know that the pyramids were aligned with the stars and it's just that that just kind of open something up\nAnd and so I started reading a little bit more\nAnd uh and then a couple of years ago is when it really took off\nUm and and then I said I have to you know I wanted to meet some of these people I started a you know communicating and I and I met\nA Robert Duvall last year on a on a cruise and uh and I met Robert shocker\nA few months later and um you know just one thing led to another but yeah it's been an amazing um a few a couple of years in\nThe paper the latest paper I Want everybody to know all of my news published a white papers are on his website\nAnd we're going to be discussing those ads linked tonight on the program and you can get to my news website by clicking add a coast to coast am scroll down and you will see in the papers section everything listed in the rope a new is the first\nAnd so before we get to the great pyramid which is the subject of the show tonight uh you and a Robert Duvall and Robert shock\nSat down and started discussing uh the this means and published that paper what was it that happened over breakfast where the light bulbs started going off that got you involved in all of this\nYeah what you know this is a\nGoes back to Orion mystery so I you know while I was reading things I haven't met the two gentlemen yet the authors\nUm I I was a you know I talked to myself if if an architect ah builds the three pyramids a and a line and and want it to align them with the three belt starts with a wry and\nThey had to be some kind of record and you know it was it your pauses believed that uh the architect of the great pyramid the first one of the three with him you know\nAnd so I looked at the stature I started looking at the statue of he looked at some of the inscriptions to see if there's any clue that uh would uh you know prove that he actually conceive that that way\nAnd and so while I Am so I looked at the statue and there was something that um was interesting there was a symbol of a line that's on that are on the pedestal of that statue\nUm I notice it and then I just kind of put it on the back burner and then you know after I met a Robert in Croatia he gave me the or the book the that they just have coauthored origins of the things which is an amazing book by the way\nIt is yeah um and so I was reading the book and you know in Robert section he's developing a you know something that he knows the dreams the law which is you know in front of the parts of the ... between the positive things and\nThere was a a so he was talking basically about the things in this guy and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nBecause lots of things in the sky and he developed that part of the book and and then I asked myself well what about this things on the ground why is it that there is no reference to it\nUm as far as we know before the Puritans were built if there was a ... then it ... it would have been such an amazing monument that they should have been no mention of it and that's how this came together so then I remember this statue I remember the lying is on the pedestal one thing led to another I post something on my Facebook page\nRobert saw it and then he wanted to discuss it and then you know or at the um I think it was cosmic origins in Sedona is where we met again and that's where I first met Robert shock and we were sitting\nAt breakfast at night I knew I only you know I had to get this out in\nLess than a minute and it was so compelling that I didn't even have to try it just came out in less than a minute and we uh we looked at each other and there was a moment of silence and we just knew there was something about it this uh this could be very important and that's how that paper came about\nWhy is it I Know that you listened to my opening comments tonight yeah why is it that the well the ... applied to in general but you have the great pyramid the grades things are two things that dominate everything that you can see for miles\nBut he's not documented the anywhere\nIn Egypt history where you would think well you know the ... love to write everything he'd love to go and tell their story and not only that but taxes in in accounting in season everything all of their daily lives all of the stories are told except\nFor the grades things in the great pyramid why isn't missing in history\nYeah that that's a it's an excellent point I um I I of course I don't know Jimmy um I I mean you know the one answer you could give is that maybe we just we haven't found records or the records were destroyed\nUm but it is there is a there is a striking paucity or or maybe total absence um and of course that was the problem with the things you know I thought to myself that if we want to prove if we want to go into each apology territory and give them the\nKind of proof that they won an inscription that refers to the ... for example than ah than we have to really look we have to we have to take a good look at what we have and hope to find something and you know I think I think we found something at least is things um\n[noise] the pyramids we um you know when you're on next so that when you buy the great pyramid there is a tool in front of the six a dynasty maybe a hundred and fifty years two hundred years after a you know who fool key ops was alive and if you walk into that to him do is actually a reference\nTo the great pyramid and also to the ... in in in the two of them is called uh the whole rise of coup fool and next to it it's the um the you know the the conference grade so in in in the old kingdom the great pyramid was actually ... pyramid\nSo they call that cover his grade and Google's pyramid was called their whole lives of Google\nAnd so this was a brief that was a you know supervising or other priests that were on the plot so and so okay there is an inscription but you're absolutely correct it is that is the glaring exception you don't really see too much\nYou earn the pyramid yeah you wouldn't expect and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to\nActing and like I said an owner's manual we don't have but but there isn't even a general reference to to point is in the direction\nAnd forget about the other something about how it was built or who built it or the year was built you know we still don't even understand the purpose and that it gives you all\nThe way to have auditors um you know fifth century but see now this was in during personal rule um two thousand years after the fact and and what is the writing the way he describes it raises more questions than answers\nUm I mean he does get into a little bit of detail you know you're saying that it took ten years to build a ramp up to the particle and then the pyramid was Twenty years um and there were machines that were hauling up to box but\nYou would think that you know just like what you just said you would think it should be a detailed account of how it was done but uh it's not\nThe uh the other part of this or that is just is confusing is the great things yet we also have those same issues and if there was a for the dream style a while and the inventory Stella ... we may not know anything at all\nBut yes\nThat was the dream still or is it you know there was a dispute or at the turn of a um twentieth century that may be tougher laws to force who is the author of the dream still up between the part of the things that he has to want to build it that was actually being debated\nUm but uh and there is a there is a small\nReference to ... but it's it's it's broken away so there's no way you can say that um that keep it definitely does not say that he built it\nUm and so that's the drinks are like the image towards the ... all the other hand it's very direct it specifically states\nUm first of all it makes it very clear that will go for care what actually ... I mean ... I don't know some of the listeners may think those are two different things but it's the same as it keeps the Greek name Cooper's the Egyptian name it's the same person\nSo that even towards the ourselves very under critically what came to the plateau distinct already existed in fact it was broken you repair it and then he built his pyramid and that was the end the pyramid of his queen Newt so\nOkay let's take a break right here will pick up when we come back where we are leaving off right now the coast to coast am our nearest you'd be church or ... my news said is adding and it's all the great pyramid all night long we'll be right back stay with us\nFind out if you're already a victim of title fraud get your hundred dollar shirt free with sign up this at home titled luck dot com\nHome title luck dot com\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWalking back to the coast to coast am I'm you're assuming church it's the great pyramid all my big beef or we get to the great pyramid\nOur guest is minute say Saudi and my new uh we were talking about the inventory Stella and the dream Stella right before the break and I want to get back to the dream Stella briefly before we start to move forward and in the dream Stella\nA top most the fourth says mentions and and illustrates two ... thinks is there\nAnd desert Fox just tweeted is there a second Spanx\nWell there's two ... says there I Know that Robert shock is referring to the possibility of the second ... being in the sky I think it's actually west of the great pyramid behind it that's that's my take a ... is there a second ...\n... it's a great question on a so that was for that was Robert ... who is interpreting the second things uh as the celestial things in other words the constellation Leo\nBut uh and you brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double edits things\nYou brought this up in the last interview and it's a it's a great question and it's a good point um there are actually depictions of a double headed things are and that double headed things is in the underworld and of course he's a is\nA ... you know a cemetery and I know that a cemetery is is what the Egyptians thought was the underworld and it was guarded on each end by as things\nAnd these depictions are um you know they're on unmistakable\nSo so the answer to this question specific golf course it hasn't been found there is but there are stories uh Arab historians referred to\nAs an actual things on the other side of the Nile which was dismantled and you know the ground was used to build mosques so they're they're apparently was physical things\nAre on the other side of denial but is there are things buried under this sounds a that say west of ah coffers pyramid it's possible\nThe\n... you had mentioned that uh ...\nSaid that he repaired this being but build the greed pyramid there are others that have interpreted the inventory still is saying that he was just to repair guy\nBut he was there to repair and straighten up the great pyramid why did discrepancy\nYeah uh let me preface it real quick um because I mentioned as yet of course Egypt colleges most Egypt causes do not accept in mentors the law as a historical document\nAnd ah for various reasons and Robert shocking I recently published a paper where we counter there's arguments so we're actually saying is it is authentic and we think that it's mostly factual so I just wanted to say that but\nJust to be fair to both sides um so to your question\nUm ... the ah you have to go to the texture analysis to distinguish rebuilding from building so if you look at the left side of this still out there is a strip of text and on in that text or the ... it's talking about rebuilding the temple of ISIS\nAnd the specific symbol we discuss this last time is a symbol that in Egypt she means to be a means repeat again and if you combine that symbol with the with the with the word for building which is a bad\nAh so the comes the combination is bad for him if you if you put those two together it means you're rebuilding on the other side of this still a\nA is a is a strip of Texas where you know the pyramid building has mentioned and the the verb that that this is not further a qualified with this word and based on that is that I was saying that the pyramid was built the temple was rebuild\nUm is that a hundred percent poof no of course not and people have criticized even the you know the fires of ... that was found in ... in the red sea\nYou know they are saying well you okay this is my ... talks about to a store and being ... a ship to he's a um but it doesn't prove that the entire pyramid was built it could just be could have just been repaired and I I have to admit that's correct I I think we can only say we can only go by what it actually states\nAnd what it actually states is that ... was being shipped to ease up of course Chris Dodd and uh who you mean it was a ... interview you have written the other day he made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was billed as that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nHe made a good point you said that uh he thinks the way it was billed as that first of all the perimeter was built and then it was backfield\nAnd so that means that if you ship tour to ... that means you were building you know some part of the perimeter\nOr as you went up to courses and then you ... leaders so that means it was probably a you know part of the actual construction of the pyramid but you know I just wanted to bring up some of the issues and I just want to be even handed about it and just you know a deliver the information and then people have to make up their mind about it\nAnd there was a quite a bit of relatives are you uh you know pyramids that coup booze dealing with uh also wanted to use a plateau right there be a reference to one of those smaller pyramid\nThere are you oh you mean in the image oyster yes yes\nYes there is a there is a reference to a head Knutson um hit Knutson uh this is also you know a ... a contentious subject so who went to a new to it so she was supposedly is queen\nAnd uh he built a pyramid for her but the southern most of the three ah off the tree a green permits that are on the east field or on the eastern side of the great pyramid\nAnd um but\nIn the human stories though it says that she was a princess and based on that comment each opposes that is one of the reasons why they're rejecting to sell out because they're saying there is no evidence that they knew it was a princess ... again ... and I are diffusing that argument in the paper so we actually\nAh submit prove that gee I in fact was a princess or or at least that we're saying we we think is the poop shows that she was a print says\nSo that was one of the relatives mentioned um and then don't you know there's mentions of ISIS and hot or\nA an old Cyrus on this Stella and that those are much further reasons why Egypt poses reject this though because they're saying\nYou know if this were an oath giving them story or at the time of coup who he's got a you know ISIS on his eyes were not yet a work being worship there weren't not official states sanctions a deity\nAnd we also you know try to diffuse that argument as well\nUm but you know it's it's a contentious I I I don't want to make it sound like we have the outs or we have all the answers perfectly locked up\nThere's another glaring issue here and that is all of the surroundings smaller pyramids\nAre crumbling may don't even look like they were built by the same engineers or by the same hands with the same pair right and those would be more simple to build and you would you would expect those to be just as elegant if even\nYou know more complex yeah they're not and they're just don't work is is is just awful\nWell that I saw the problem is of course that the ... have been a you know walked off there still owns\nAnd so what we're seeing are is the left over um I actually you know I was interested in that same ... you just call me that you just made I was in Egypt a couple of weeks ago and I went to a nuisance pyramid to see you know a little bit ... take a closer look at the craftsmanship and I was very impressed with the few casing stones that were left in place\nAnd I would say that they are in terms of uh in terms of the quality a you know they're smaller size but in terms of the quality I didn't really think that there's any difference to uh the casing stones around the great pyramid um so I but I think the caller yes it looks pretty dilapidated\nUh and of course the pyramids after the old king them um\nBut I think the caller yes it looks pretty dilapidated uh and of course the pyramids after the old King I'm I'm a you know middle ... most of them are falling apart so you know you're absolutely correct the the the workman ship definitely declined um after the old kingdom\nNow let's get to a what happened last year which was the big news about this new chamber above the grand gallery yeah after we haven't been told over and over again\nAnd it just it hasn't stopped that there is nothing to find inside of the great pyramid there's nothing there well clearly that is not the case there is something above the grand gallery what it is we do not know but when that news broke what did you think\nUm I thought to myself this is this is what are the greatest news in archaeology of the century I think this is uh it's amazing um and the and what I liked about it is that it was non invasive you didn't have to drill old she didn't have to you know like a\nThe I provide certain protections for individual who dial nine one one

I'm going to get to the top half of the pyramid and we're going to work on that in a second but got some calls that have been holding for quite a while to speak with you my new let's go to Barry in South Carolina Barry welcome back to coast\nHello there ... and you know what I'm getting ready to say yeah man\nYou know go ahead Barry it's yours\nGo back late Cathy\nYou liked that my news you like that the area [laughter] okay I\nAm today or I always love hearing is that all that it may have or do you place great for me to keep it up power\nAnd thank you bury what do you have for a minute tonight\nOh I've got two questions and then I've got a great little short clean quick joke about their child yesterday and\nThe first question they asked her is credited with Jimmy\n... uh the deciphering and learning to read hieroglyphics and then the second question is\nAll Howard graphics around go back recap in Egypt in that area of the world the same however are good things that are found and the pyramids of Mexico central and south ...\nIs the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff cliff ticket scripts\nCentral and south ...\nIs the ... so the question is how are you asking if there are a hero cliff cliff again scriptures and go back like that that is that what you're asking\nOr no I'm asking is are the hieroglyphics that are written all the ... and Egypt on a pair of the civil war and go back at the other to save our lives that are found on the ms in Mexico and central and South America\nOh okay I understand I'm not I don't think so yeah there are different ... there are different ... and it's interesting you asking this question because you are\nYou are basically giving a conclusion that I'm investigating as we speak you are saying that the era lipic inscriptions in gold Becky heavy in other words you're implying there is a there is there is writing there and um and I am currently looking into that I think you might be onto something\nNow there is I'm going to say one thing let me jump in Barry okay although I'm not an archaeologist and I don't have any fancy degrees after my name on it but there are certain things that are are in\nNot only on the stones at at going back to happy but also in Egypt and tend to repeat around the world with different cultures are they the same I don't know there is an H on the belt\nThat looks very similar to the age blocks and ... are are they related I don't know right there are some astrological signs in Beckley tabby\nAre they are they representing the zodiac ah that were in then Darrow\nAnd throughout Egypt and throughout the rest of the world after that\nAre they the same I don't know but I'm going back lead happy being that old certainly is indicating that they were the first Senate is the oldest is it the same language\nAnd then that no I I don't think so but the zodiac symbols and some of the other symbolic she liked the I call it the army's age I'm the bells when that looks like but at that age that ages repeat it\nThere's a very exciting possibility um regarding that question to ask and go back to the um and it's regarding the civil that you mentioned Jimmy there's a very exciting possibility but I Can't prove it yet but I probably I might be able to prove it so and then we'll let you when we'll let everybody know\nI don't know we'll do right here on coast to coast oh there was one other uh one other point that I wanted to make about uh uh go Beckley taffy and it just got away from me bury it was right there but it just disappeared and I'll mention it later on in the show thank you very\nNo problem thanks for al\n... absolutely and uh the phone lines my new I expected this ah are completely jammed up let's get in one more call on all of the yeah let's let's go to this is a let's go to\nLet's go to my dad in New York my uh Europe next\nYes good morning gentlemen and great guinea and now\nI Do find that to ... I like to know if he\nHad looked at any of that highway that goes up the highway of any age and I and I'm off I think that might be the one that would be found in medical knowledge that they have if if if I'm correct on that they take a lot of\nTheir second pot and I know\nDeals with the founding medical knowledge that they have if if if I'm correct on that particular one the second part and I'll listen over there and is whether he and and and ... and and shock ... had can sit and some of the um\nThe African and African American style lays who's studied the net net net to add\nA week his name of the language which is is is still out of that that ... that to a phrase itself deals with this sacred\nWhether he looked at people who call themselves a huge cabinet for instead of the gift shop and you know a before they\nDid Greeks came in and consider themselves to be Ken that colleges cabinet is where we got word from foot chemistry and also um the what you call I think\nWas that was it was ... I think we Scott came up with and to me what they can fly with the little if not what it is and the African American outlets that I'm thinking of they call it a little on the horizon so they use that time to renew old\nOh sad if you follow him a question and I'll listen off the air\nThank you my great okay three questions in my new I'm going to get to them but that just goes to show you the extend knowledge here because they don't play around on the first\nQuestion um I I I Am all I have heard of the ... but the the one that I have looked at more specifically regarding medical information\nIs the ... century actually in my\nBook um because on the reverse of the eagles PR piracy there is an interesting calendar or that's ... ... and I think um I found the solution to a this calendar and that's described in the book\nUm and and yes it's a this was in the ... so the medical knowledge just incredible we're talking about it for pirates that's I think over sixty foot long ah is describing seven hundred at these different seven hundred different ailments and their remedies\nUm and this ... I Believe dates to the middle kingdom and and reaches back are most likely a probably to him or taps time so um yes there were there were very skilled positions or the ancient Egyptians I'm\nBarred damage and which was the name of Egypt of course a group that's\nAn excellent question and I'm just going to give you a quick answer as quick as I can so um as far as we understand it you just shouldn't language originally was a composite of two different cultures the one culture was a southern Egyptian culture\nAnd that script was mostly frenetic um and the evidence from that comes from two huge a a king scorpion\nAnd that is I think were the African roots lie\nThe other script a that was intermingled initially comes from northern Egypt of probably from Bhutto\nAnd brutal was a sort of a trading a settlement in in the delta and they were trading with ah probably as opposed to any uh with the live on and so they had a different kind of script that was mostly a big ... so it was picked up Rob's\nUm so what you saw is what it meant while in the south what you hear is what it meant and so I think your question is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a originally African ...\nQuestion is very well taken and I think yes I think the uh the southern Egyptian script was probably a ritually Africa and maybe you know what their hair or maybe I'm maybe even further south\nAnd she brought up another really good point uh before we get to the break we've got about thirty seconds it was the Greeks adapting ah the ... G A chemistry coming from candidate\nRight yes\nIssue I think she mentioned is so why are we we think that speaks was making before uh before Africa game I think it was we would think it was the lioness and their name was ... and by the way that's also probably an African of African origin\nLet's take a break right here coast to coast am it's all Great Pyramid all Egypt to all my lawn or just tonight my new save Saturday is paper is right there click on his website coast to coast am we're going to discuss the rest of it after the break stay with us\n[noise] to find\nIf you're considering going back to school after is also following questions do you need the flexibility to take classes and your schedule you have college credit to transfer do you want to earn a quality degree from a world renowned university if you answered yes to any of these questions\nArizona State university is the perfect school for you\nArizona State university offered over one hundred and fifty highly wing degree programs one hundred percent on line\nYou learn the same degree as he went on campus from wherever you are on your scheduled press on the one line exceptional transfer credit for information text live two three five five lines setting\nLearned for yourself fly all the it was ranked number one for innovation by US News and World Report and learn to thrive with Arizona State university for more information about all the one line tax live two three five five one Saturday and that's how the e two three five five one second\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to the coast to coast am I'm your host Jimmy church I guess the night and my new safe side they were talking about are the great pyramid and the discovery of not only chambers inside of the great pyramid\nBut his formula and his wife paper they published last week\nOn how to locate them and I want to say really quick Manu that Twitter I expected this uh is is going a bit nuts right now and you can follow me on Twitter at a ... church radio and post your questions or comments about Tonight Show\nEither of for me or or buy new right there and this question just came in before we get to a a page out of three twenty eight of of of this report a minute this is the question this is from ... Kim\nShe says is it true that the measurements of the great pyramid or possibly coordinates and that does coordinates point to somewhere um in in the past that they believe are coordinates to haven't\nHaven't yes\nUm I haven't worked I propose\nIt's great to see this is this is what I really enjoy a about the coast audience and and I guess like yourself there is so much information out there but there's also the lack of information and we are trying to figure out the great mystery of of of the pyramid\nYeah and this is one of those questions where\nThe math of the the Great Pyramid has revealed so many different not only a a mathematical equations but numbers that are beyond coincidence and that they are they're all over the great pyramid\nHave I have one piece of information that might be interesting to the listener um there isn't a good friend of mine and author Alison green who is looking he's a Shakespeare expert and he has been able to connect uh the uh the title page of the ... Shakespeare sonnet\nTo the coordinates or not to heaven but of course Allen might say it is ever write a ... to the corners of the great\nUh not to heaven but uh of course Allen might say it is ever write a ... to the coordinates of the great pyramid and specifically ah the the coordinates that Alan just discovered a fall right next to the ... which is next to the great pyramid\nAllen's work is some of the most groundbreaking game changing work out there I'm going to have 'em on coast a a very soon probably next month\nAnd is you're absolutely right in the title page of the sun and it's with a Shakespeare\nAnd his work Allen greens work and decide ... page and ... what is revealed\nIs I have never been as freaked out as I was uh when I saw his presentation with that and interviewed him about it it's it's absolutely incredible and we'll have Marcos next month\nOkay so now that the top half of the pyramid yes a U.S said at the beginning of the show let's get to this it's on page number three twenty eight everybody in the ... the the ... report ...\nThe top half you had said at the beginning of the show\nPossibly six to eight additional chambers where we had been told there are none\nBy right and so um you know when we talked about a um a gun to your Rudolph got to break last time a Jimmy\nUm remember we're talking about the queen of the southern shaft of the queen chamber and there is something that I forgot to mention she was so what guns and bring a found is when you get to a gun to bring store\nJust before the the the floor off of the of the canal drops suddenly it's there's a depression\nAnd the way he is interpreting one of the two ways he interpreted that is there must be a space that allowed that forward to cave in slightly so that that's what he proposed in Nineteen Ninety three and if I look at the um you know these courses that we've just been discussing\nIs a good possibility that that that he is right there is probably a space that made that came in\nAnd that might correlate with uh if I go back to three twenty six well quick\nThat could correlate with of course that's marked with ten twenty fifth um and and then that let's go out and so you know there's some there is evidence that there are spaces and uh this particular space not been detected by me on again\nNow the row mutts or let's let's get to this for a second in the uh the audience is going to look at the numbers that you have represented here which is a starting at ... eighty four which is a shaft\nUm and uh it it going up words every body of one of seven\nA and I'm looking at it here as it continues a these are rose layers of the construction that have a different sides in a different thickness on these roads right\nRight right yeah and and in this graphic or you know one of these canals as his show going all the way to the surface and that is incorrect so I just use the illustration is is an older list ration I'm so that it that particular chef did not go to the surface of the wall\nBut yes so we have all the different courses that have round fractions of twenty fifth in in terms of the surface area ratio and um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in ...\nAnd he fits in in terms of the surface area ratio and um and by a by the rules that you know I Am basically establishing in the lower part of the pyramid I'm proposing that every single one of these courses is associated with the ceiling in other words\nThere is a space at designed space not not you know an accidental space designed space that correlates with each one of these particular courses no\nYou just got back from Egypt yes we have to discuss the ongoing move on a project their which uh did help them find this ... this new chamber above the grand gallery\nYes who describe what you saw in the grand gallery well when you were there\nRight so I saw a new detectors being placed um I at this time in a different location than last time so last time the detectors were placed inside the green chamber and this time it's very obvious you walk up to a grand gallery to the king chamber and there are I think twenty seven twenty eight boxes\nAnd I kind of knew their detectors but I asked to confirm and there was confirmed that the scouting\nNow for the audience tell them what to do on detectors actually do where do they used for\nRights are these are particles that are created in the stratosphere so when cosmic radiation hits the atmosphere of particle called them you want is created enemy on is\nA negative they charge like an electron um uh but it is a is a bit heavier ah didn't electron but it can pass through solid matter it's travels at the speed of light it's lifetime is just over two seconds\nI'm and but it can penetrate through solid objects\nAnd so because of those properties you can use it just like an X ray and you know you take an extra person you can see the bones you can see somebody organs and in this case you can basically quote unquote X ray the pyramid you put the detectors below where you think there is something and then uh it showed ... then you have a chance\nTo see a space or because of ... will travel more rapidly through open air than you know through solid stone so if you have a space in the ... way of what you're what you're looking for than those nuance will arrive more rapidly and they and more often will arrive and you will be able to see that on the detector\nWould these detectors placed in the grand gallery could they be used to find the ... the chambers that you are proposing in the ever happened to me\nIt is possible um I think the reason why they're doing that is because they got criticized by an Egypt colleges are that the data maybe artifacts will and I think they using
