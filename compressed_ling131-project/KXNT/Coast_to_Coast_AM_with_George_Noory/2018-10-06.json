I saw it on the movie or um I saw him walk through the wall or their blood dripping down the wall\nYou know George if I saw something like that I probably never going to another person's\nHouse

funerals a day seven days a week that so many people want to talk to their loved one for the last\n... she's always knew their cash during a funeral or are they is\nNormally yes standing at the foot of the casket because that's usually where the life family is standing and people come up to greet them and then they walk over to the casket and pay their last respects\nAnd so anything that said they can hear because they're very very nosy and as to what people are saying about them or how they look or you know they they like to know that stuff\nAnd but in the last seven or eight years\nThis business where the IRS table set off to the side with all these photos and their life in pictures\nAnd if there's a group of people standing around by those pictures than this bureau will go over there and listen to what they're saying and it's funny because I've already been there where a man said see that lady with that had on over there I said yep he\nSaid well she's saying that that picture happened when we were in Missouri she's out or her mind we weren't in Missouri when that happened we were in Pennsylvania\nAnd it's like okay you know\nI'm not going to go argue with your lady

neighbors there are\nYa I remind at any rate\nI go to this ... this particular funeral and the man was standing at the foot of his casket and he looked at me he said you could see me\nI said I can and I told them who I was and he said I bet my daughter bounds you she would find somebody crazy like you\nAnd I'm thinking okay and so I said well I said yes your daughter did call me and he says I got my son doesn't know anything about this and I said to the to the daughter I said does your brother in law you called me she says oh yeah he's really into this and I just sort of looked him you'd rather and gave him aside\nLook and so he said well call my son over half a recall my son over so he says to me tell my son to go home right now that my brother bill is in my basement trying to break

sun I said your uncle bill is in your dad's house right now in the basement trying to break open the gun cabinet and the sun looks at me he goes no he's not I just saw on the half hour ago and I said\nPoint him out to me he's lucky he says you know I don't really see him\nI Am the father said my house is two streets over I says apparently your father's house is only two streets over and he

I think somebody put a curse on me and and I said ... let's let's think about this for a moment ... who would want to do this to you I mean you're good fun person you're nice person you don't hurt anybody\nAnd we started talking and she mentioned the promotion and she mentioned some people that they gave her the job over and I went oh huh and I said\nOf a couple of these people is there one there that you would think would be capable of that and she said yes ... and sure enough it ended up being a person of who apologized and took the curse off apparently and everything's fine but\nStop sending negative energy to her a war off right he was ...\nSo my question is when someone does get hit by a curves mhm how easy is it for that person to try to distinguish who puts\nWhen someone does get hit by a Kurdish mhm how easy to use it for that person to try to distinguish who put the curse on them\n[noise] that's a little bit harder and the main questions that I ask when I'm actually doing the removal is [noise] um did you take somebody away from their spouse in other words did you have an affair with a married person believe\nYou me a woman you know ... ... you get a man gets angry at somebody and they're going to find somebody in the nose a woman gets angry at somebody ... women are meaner than men she's gonna curse that person\nAnd because she was hurt more ways than one and the job thing is exactly right you can't believe how often that happens and but the bottom line is this who cares who did it just get it off\nHow do you get it all and you do to show you have to call Murray and when ... how do you get at all\nNope you can't remove it yourself but you can have a friend do it for you and again they don't have to believe that they just have to go through the ritual and in when go speak the whole last chapters how to remove negative energy\nCan do it you just can't do it to yourself\nUse every Monday susceptible to a curse word about someone who's got so much energy in positivity and they put up for ... for you to kind of block it and she you\nKnow unfortunately the only thing that I personally know that his work forever because once the curses removed that doesn't necessarily stop the person that was putting it on they're not going to know it's off\nThe end there's so many different kinds of curses I mean there's one that that maybe has to be do something at every full moon or generational curses they just automatically go with generation to generation like the Kennedys you have to know they were first\nAnd so there's all kinds of different kinds but once it's removed most people as long as they you know I give him that Quincy to carry as long as they have that they never have to have a curse removed off of them again it does not affect them\nAs a matter of fact I think about the ballplayers let's use um baseball players for instance\nOkay there's the game between the Cleveland Indians and maybe New York and so all the fans and the Cleveland Stadium every time there best hitter gets up the whole stadium is going oh lose you jerk don't hit the ball given out and then they clap if he does\nIts negative energy thrown on that person's\nOh yeah absolutely and that's why the home team is an advantage\nChats exactly right but that doesn't mean when they get on their playing to leave Cleveland that he left the negative energy here it's going with him it's going to be added on every other stadium that is not his home stadium\nSo and that's why I Do so many ballplayers all kinds of all players\nWill her ...

because I'm fascinated by\nIt I Know I Know you are and it is it is an extremely a beautiful card the scarred as is the devil card and the tower usually three cards which people think are the most\nUh uncomfortable parts of the major our economy but every card in the tower deck has a positive and negative aspect\nI'm In the modern tarot which is really my forte um has really moved since uh you know

four six eight seven seven six six nine we'd like you to call and be part of our discussion later in the program\nTonight we're talking with Richard Pryor as Richard is a research and development scientist specializes in solar energy and the question is can we power a hundred percent of the planet\nWith solar energy Richard welcome to be on reality radio it's great to have you on here with us tonight good evening\nI'm actually going on so let's get started by um I guess we'll start with learning a little bit more about you tell us about yourself where were you professionally and how did you get involved in this particular part of science\nA been a solar energy all of that the thirty years' in my life got started in the eighties one very few people who are involved in and\nAcross the industry and uh the progress in science since then and now we're reaching a point to a very close to two exploding in uh Indiana oh gee well\nI'd say ten to Fifteen Years from now it's gonna be the the major uh industry that putting you see energy on Senate or in the U.S on the whole country on the planet\nI'm Sorry what did you see the timeframe was that you expected that\nI'd say ten to Fifteen Years all that\nNow I'm you know I just saw a report today and I mentioned in in the first segment that I'm OPEC is saying that they expect oil to hit a hundred dollars a barrel again in the last time we were in that territory we had economic virtual economic collapse\nNot just in the United states but around the world um it was one of the major reasons we went into such freefall for a while um you know when we see things like that\nHow much does that provide a catalyst in motivation for these alternative technologies like solar to um be invested in developed and actually brought to the point where they are in economically viable alternative\nI think it helped set up but not necessarily a I think at forty dollars a barrel will they be cheaper five years from now ... well that spoke of getting the cheapest way of making it took\nEffect today today to make a a kid or what our welcome\n... well on the cusp of getting the cheapest way of making electricity in fact today today to make a a kid or what our wealth and I'd like to see the lowest cost way of doing it is probably to sort of or take solar cells and the only drawback come the reason why it's not\nYet fully exploding is that\nSolar energy not control of all of these flexible so it works with the weather is so we have to develop the ways of transforming than liable energy into from our generation but it's a they have some\nPretty good way of doing that and I like good feeling and light into the show\nEnding as well is that tend to have some nice going to be it's gonna be solar driving the economy so\nGood I was just gonna say did I hear you correctly even as it stands right now the least expensive way to produce a kilowatt of electricity is through a solar energy\nToday yes buddy you have to remember that that's kinda what is is as you get caught in the ... strain ... comes with the weather so you have a ... one of the sunshine\nAnd if the problem with that the economy needs to you know what what it means that you know what that night selling a winter on a cloudy day\nSo transforming that very cheap you know what we can already make today into something that can be twenty four seven there is a ... month actually got there that's that's why the inventions out taking place now to create the beauties going all\nWilling GV and I talked about that are actually last week talking about the one of the biggest problems with solar is if it's cloudy out\nWhat's happening you know you're not able to I I have stolen or that I used to recharge my a boat batteries and and the ... nature and the end of course I'm constantly checking the voltage coming out of it and if it's if it's a cloudy day I'm getting nowhere near the power we are but I Am wondering when it's a sunny day\nAbsolutely that's why you have to do just studied up out of the books thinking um they'll they'll fall ways of making a that's ... that's all at night you know what they do have to you all the time\nOne east to spread out the results because it's always sunny somewhere so you use that joke but I think he's pushing to bring the power but you need some we have a very strong at a trickle network in this country it would not would not have to make it much stronger out to carry solar power of a\nDistance he's from sunny place to an all sunny place that's number one I think it's something the only solution number two is of course a energy storage\nPutting twelve oaks into the battery but that of and I'm a cloudy day I might only be getting four or five will soon said I Would have three of those units yet or each one producing four or five votes and again given me when I needed\nThat cod and since those units are getting cheaper and cheaper you probably would would get them and smell that more yeah smaller and smaller because they are more efficient they can come from all the sudden into an actress even when I get started\nYou could convert about ten percent of\nIncoming solar energy into electricity today the best known juice commercially available not just not not a lot of things to think that you can actually buy hunting stole nail approaching twenty five twenty five percent of Russian\nSo Richard um any of those solutions that you mentioned to solve the problem that some places just don't have nearly as much sun and I think you're an\nOld are you in Albany New York I'm In Albany New York and I'm In I'm In\nCooperstown New York we don't get a lot of sun here I'm so any of these solutions I Would imagine you have to have some type of storage capability to half\nYeah your battery involved right yep yep storage he's a he's the goo so but it's not old story and if you if you're going to have only storage\nIt's going to be hopelessly expensive it cannot be done so you have to have the same old commission of spreading out the resources strengthening the grid over building your TV having storage on the fault solution one thing that helps also has to\nWin the some form of solar energy although it's it's ... solar energy as it is still used by the sun indirectly it's combining a solar and wind so you can take advantage of the\nThe fact that they are viable then it in different ways and they tend to complement each other\nCan take advantage of the the fact that they are viable then it in different ways and they tend to complement each other or when when\nWhen you combine those false solutions together you get to a solution which is rather\nInexpensive on\nOn the cusp of being commercially very attractive to deliver a twenty four seven a sign on to the markets\nIf we had um a solar array that was powering our homes now would we are we talking about every home has its own system that independent of others are we talking about a ah connected\nNow that it has to be connected ... and you're talking to someone who's had a solar system on now how somebody out all the last twenty five years so I used to be the homeowner and in fact I uh I have a big cities semi ... N.Y a medic trick or\nLike I can say I'm a hundred percent solo I see my car with solar power I commute some ... electricity\nOn but\nIn reality I'm not a hundred percent so when I see that he got on the greatest should take my son on a cloudy day to buy back so having every solo\nHolmes totally independent cut off from the green on living in the legal system\nThat's not gonna work you know when you go ahead and we need to interrupt going to take advantage of the grade on one one\nExample I gave all the ways to two people left me around all the money that could cause security it's sold on the ... hotel then yeah you really can't we can't do that states that think the Bronx things Queens New York and there is no way it's gonna work down there\nToo many people not enough space so we have to design\nThe solar system of the future to be able to study the power to those major centers of consumption because otherwise it's going to be on the marginal solar\nDo we have a sense is I'm sure the math has been done and I'm sure you know what it is um what is the surface area the space required for a solar panel to be able to provide enough power per capita per individual\nBack I Would have to do the D. V. D. version per individual but I I've done a\nYear we are at fault the in fact when just get a paper published today with that number on in ... I'm going to open it as we speak to two hundred percent sold the fall for the United states\n\nSo bear with me a second sure new information hot off of the research Journal of the press [laughter] I have to open that figure ...\n... yeah well Richard is looking for that or remind you the phone number is eight four four six eight seven seven six six nine I Would love to hear from anyone who is installed solar panels into their home currently in what they you know what benefits they're seeing how much it's made a difference in their ... economics of their home\nAnd I and I can attest to that are very close friend of mine Jeremy I spent a big investment on having a they put on his house and now he he was telling me a few weeks ago that his average electric bill\nMight be anywhere from nine dollars to thirty something dollars a month with what you're used to be chewing change be and he's ...\nFoot waves set up I guess she sells it back to the electric car yeah\nAnd so forth ...\nIndividuals Ryan I my electric DTs essentially zero zero zero around so\nThat I Know and everybody cannot do that\nI my electric DTs essentially zero zero zero around so\nBut I Know and everybody cannot do that like I mean well enough\nTo actually getting ready to put a device on his house that will actually follow the sun it'll mhm actually turn the solar panels to to follow the sun where it is at a time of the day\nShow and that's that's one way of doing it so I I have that number okay from the paper we just published today and it's twenty two thousand square kid on matters so to go back to square miles to divide by two point five so about ten thousand square on line so\nIt would require it today with today's technology all the anti US would require I'm Sorry what was the ... how many square miles a day ten twelve thousand square on ten to twelve thousand square miles of surface area with panels on them to um to power the United states as it is today that includes industrial may need everything\nEverything it doesn't include if you add transportation all electric transportation to that you can to try that number by sixty percent say it looks like a big number ... until you put it into context\n\nIt's roughly the size of the debt routes high intensity urban development it's about the same size of a high density Deborah line it's about one third of the size of medium density of and never mentioned to us\nSo now but the ramifications on that there was a there was actually a video that was going around that people were were looking at a while back and it was of these birds that seemed to miraculously be just exploding while they're in the air and come\nTo know that you're you're talking up another technology here which which will not work which is too expensive and you're talking about concentrating towers\nOkay well you have the the mirrors focusing on a tower on making two thousand degree temperature and boiling water on making steam turbines work ethic wrote ... way too expensive out there and live as somebody totally different than yeah and the birds fly now of course ...\nYeah exactly oh and my question was with with that many solar panels though I I I have seen solar panels on homes and everything and they do give off a very reflective look and I think you'd agree with that\nThen it would well no more than a window [noise] oh okay well All right I always thought it was more it's not like a mirror but an\nInterest in fact they should not directly teen if you think about it the solar panels needs to take in the ... energy so each week you said reflect see me sending you know gene back he doesn't want to do that so that the ideal ... future with non meat or ethnic TV it's going to try to take in as much as he's gotten on converting to electricity\nSo it'd be definitely different than a lot of the ones that are out there now with America\nYes the best ... dog black can they'll they'll last reflect heat than the old one that was shiny I in fact my old and also I already shining this on the new one I have a very dark roof now\nWe're talking with Richard ... research and development scientist specializing in solar energy can we power a hundred percent of our energy needs across the globe with solar energy that's our discussion tonight\nOr on the phone number is eight four four six eight seven seven six six Megan to a free day for four six eight seven seven six six million we'd like to hear from you if if you deal with solar if you if your house is powered by solar and and so forth given show you're listening to ...
