feeling but I thought that was it for me it was a strange feeling\nGeorge I wanted to tell you I don't know if you ever went to my website but I was home lots of times\nOh thank you I was at the world Trade Center when nine eleven occurred because my husband and I had an apartment very club through like a thousand feet from from the world Trade Center and we moved there about a month before buildings\nCame down gosh yeah I mean is there a month and on the day we moved to end jak and I looked up and the world trade\nCenter with towering over our little building on liberty cart and ah I said you know we said to each other boy this thing comes down we're finished well exactly a month later they'd come down as you know and we were\nWe had to leave the building and because it was unsafe to be there so many people in that area had to leave but we came back a few days later when it was safe and I had the most of the nominal experience and that's where my website where um what happened\nI I I actually had gone to sleep and I was awake and and told to go into the living room\nAnd to help people to cross over because they were coming through had created a portal in my building and in my apartment and the people who were had just died were coming through and being released out into the onto the harbor by the statue of liberty that was Battery Park\nSo that was one of the many incredible experiences I've had and thousands of people see they just kept coming coming I guess you know\nAre you still up in that area Joyce\nOh we saw that apartment I wouldn't my husband passed away and then now I'm In Florida but uh just like so many incredible things have people would just try to remember some of the things that happened to them I think most people\nNow I'm In Florida but uh just like so many incredible things that people would just try to remember some of the things that happened to them I think most people say well I was just and you know something that just happened but write them down recording your dreams as I'm sure your your next guests has got to tell us\nBut write everything down and try to analyze what you're experiencing the best way to

Joyce killer of course the sidekick and your phone calls will will do some readings Joyce with everything that you do it in your field what would you say has been the most fulfilling aspect of what you do\nI think the medium sip hard to say maybe I'm ... ... where people are ... when they receive messages and their loved ones and they realize that those people are not really just dead or a fixed ill or whatever they may be thinking because really\nI Love church and religious organizations but they don't do it with a big favor or they don't say that person's doing really well so I think that would be my primary methods for people to know that when you cross over you shouldn't\nGo into a place of grief let them be joy for on the other side and enjoy the hill and wellness with them so that that's really important to the medium ship brings and that ability to let people know that their loved ones doing fine\nDoes the spirit ever come to you and say the monies in the bag on the shoe box\nSure they do stuff like that\nYeah it's a lot of things and spirit or if you're out before you go this applies to everyone before you go to sleep at night\nYou ask say please tell me if you continue to ask where is it usually you get an answer if you ask me maybe three times four times you get an answer just it really hang in there with it and be diligent in your request\nKeep asking we were talking about spirit photography and you've got some of them have you taken the pictures or they're just been given do\nWell when my husband was here he took a lot of picture the always had a camera or two on his neck I took a lot of pictures so I have a lot of fear of photography I have a lot of or I have a lot of weird things going on and it's so interesting George maybe can tell me that the reason why we're in this comes out on film but it doesn't\nCome out with just the human eye thing at a wife has such a difference if they\nDo it's a huge difference and it's very strange because for some reason the camera picks up ... or ... just about everything that you can't see\nWith the human eye I mean I guess were restricted to ... to see things in a certain level a word that camera digitally and otherwise picks\nWere restricted to just see things in a certain level where the camera ... and otherwise picks it up\nThat's right it's so odd and it was a cell phone or really to the same degree that irregular ah thirty five millimeter camera would would a present it's the same thing so I have yet to figure that out spirit has not told me why but other than the fact that the uh\nThe photographer scientific photography has the ability of the I just not have and that's the only answer I could come up with so far\nIs not good\nYou know you're not being tricked by some demon or something that that is to train that deceased person somebody\nThat's a great question because if you do any kind of spirit work or you receive any kind of messages are you receive anything at all you always have to have a blessing for us to test the spirits you say really are you of God and that's really what I Would say and that's what I Would recommend everyone's saying before they become involved in this kind of work at all\nSo you always say are you of God and that's what I Would suggest and then team is can come in they will not come in or if you have any kind of threat around you or you're afraid of anything you know that they will not get past that barrier\nAnd if you're religious you could say the name of Jesus Christ or whatever you can relate to\nHave you ever witnessed an exorcist\nNo other than the movie which I did not like because books fell off the shelf by themselves unsettling so it's not a place that I Would want to go to I I Try to avoid darkness and\nYou don't play with the ... board\nNo and I know your feelings about the reach of ordinary agree with you I have a picture in my seven steps having book about\nMy ... I did a terrible thing when my son was young teens ah and my brother that we're using a weed you brought in my living room and that was sitting on a couch watching them and we were all very young at that time and my husband took a picture of it and you can see over my shoulder looking in the window behind me from outside\nA team and say oh really that's in my book seven steps\nSo ... to the phones next up Greg in North Hollywood, California November twenty six Nineteen fifty seven November twenty six Ninety seven bridge got a birthday coming up I grabbed out a\nWay Hey Greg\nPointed to test your ability because over the past few decades have met the psychics and maybe a handful [laughter] actually came up with predictions by saying like a you know what what's a quarter of the roller doing around [laughter] that's how I got there but\nThe others have worked off of the strategy saying oh you should be speaker and this and that\nSo that's how I should be anything but I'm telling you this I Will say one thing about you [noise]\nI even have at the time of your breath at Mars a sign of a Scorpio so you love secrets\nAnd you'd be a great detective and you're always looking for the solving mysteries I Will say that to you and you know you you do it very well and you basically very skeptical which is great because that's how you get answers and truth so great to somebody I can do for you\nYeah I'm Wondering if you see predicting wise or something coming up for me career or my income wise change or to make it better [laughter]\nWhat you know what I just mentioned that you love mysteries [laughter] have you ever done any kind of forensic sciences or technology or anything along those lines I detected work anything like that\nNo I Do watch a lot of these uh\nGame shows where you've got to get the words [laughter] that's a good start well are you starting a new career\nNot really I I've been in a career but then it's freelance ah independent contract work with a you know sometimes it's slow or just depending on the\nThe independent contract work with a you know sometimes it's slow or just depending on\nWhat I Would say to you is if you want to find out what's really a sole purpose and I feel that it's discovering mysteries you should really solid along those lines out just kind of study forensic for bed\nAnd when you're not doing construction and you're going to find that you have a whole part of your brain that is really exciting if you're an honest person and you love honesty and a lot of people in this field an honest so thank you saying that Greg\nCooper everything works out for you speaking of honesty joins you see something bad will you tell that person\nYou have to be honest but you have to cook it and I don't know what you mean by bad like\nMainly like it down now shining accident in action and I think I'd tell them about maybe you can avoid\nYes I had a very very very bad accident a few years ago because I did not listen guy\nTold me not to go

simple false step prices to sharing a dream of a story that makes it fun you can get it done in minutes you get some help ... feedback and you're guided tours action but there are other reasons\nWhy we're losing our dreams I mean bad habits of pots and that is part of it to be let out so the rushed out of sleep by the alarm clock but the need to get jobs do deal with the family we think that we should lie in bed and don't pay and it took eight dollars or whatever and they pay any attention\nTo those in between ... states have consciousness between sleep and wake that's a good time to catch it means good time to embark on loosened dreaming but many people don't realize that that just seemed because they're awake in the middle of the night yet ... set of losing that others\nSometimes we close off our dream because they're scared of what they might be telling us we don't want to know that we might get sick we don't want to know that our actions may not be okay we don't want to know the relationship is in trouble so we'd slammed the door and say no more dreams sometimes this is very interesting\nSometimes the kiss goodbye to our dream because we think that our dreams of giving us a luring pictures\nA possibility that we cannot none of us because they're not young enough but not rich and not whenever find the right to do the right guy and sometimes strangely we kiss goodbye to dream because we don't think we can bring from a beautiful romantic breathing space\nWhat we would like to see an hour waking life these out some of the reasons that people lose their dreams\nAnd I noticed that you know if you followed the the simple suggestions that I also you can get your dreams that you can stop dreaming again in the sense of remembering and recalling and one of the most simple ideas is\nYou might have something to them and I think you've got nothing but some say you've got nothing and just pay attention you might have a with\nYou might have a fragment and if you can call that up and begin to play with that you might have a way of getting back in touch with your dreams and another thing I'd say to people George's\nWere then the you can dream wide awake welder rounds you will speak the language of science and symbols and things but it's if you pay attention and sometimes you get Mora looks\nTo the pop ups those the pop ups and waking life that can give you ship is because you feel my gosh there's a hidden handed work that that helps to turn on the dream flown the night as well\nAs some incredible wage the dream pre cognitive lucid dreams what about these recurring dreams and you have had some stories are directly related to that well\nIt's a recurring dream is coming again and again and there's a hilarious story a mysterious reality is about a woman doctor for England who's complaining of the breakfast table oh Robert why do I keep having the same ethic dream when I got to do my medical exams\nThirty years on and I did them I keep having the same dream I said what I Would say in general or you know if if you if it really is the same ... very close to the same time it's probably because you have dreamed producers who are making a dream movie for you that's something that goes on to\nAnd they're trying to get a message through you're trying to get you to understand the situation and trying to educate you all assuming you might have some clue about what's going on they've tried to mobilize you to take some action on the situation so I I might of the stories I I picture I sort of dream production movie company\nThat is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary\nIn order to get a message across than actually\nThe movie company that is making dreams for us and repeating the performance if necessary in order to get a message across and I actually picked how I'll dream produce that might be getting very bulletin fed up with us if they have to keep on making the same\nTime but just in not getting the message of not taking action from it that's one of the ways that ... come about I mean dreams of not older people did one box we\nDo have dreamed productions where you feel and you might be quite right when you filled is that there is a production crew behind the scenes that is making a certain kind of dream to you because you need to get a message in another the stories of mysterious reality

the face in a diner in Seattle on the news or the\nPrevious story and he says to her in her dream I'm I've got a great job now I'm helping to make movies for people or that they'll see in their dreams that I'm doing the music and the special effects\n[laughter] the fact that goes on I think that's another fascinating aspect of what's happening and dreams\nWho's in charge of this though who's who's the director of these productions\nWell that's a very good question indeed it might be you that dream out if you become more conscious of what is going on and decide to step into that role until you become conscious it might be that some shadow or hidden aspect of yourself maybe if you're a high a self made you cite the wiser and fight the highest ...\nThe director I don't think any of this is alien to us I think we are connected to all of this I think the dream production company that might be staging movies for you is not alien to you is not hostile to you\nAnd is probably being run by someone with a slightly ... perspective and maybe more of a sense of humor than you currently have about your current situation because one of the ways that dream\nShock us awake into doing some course correction is\nThey dramatized and they spoof parity or what what we're doing in our lives in a way that makes it very difficult to avoid noticing that some action might be required\nDreams are powerful Robert in a eyeball we used it for my own personal life to get things done accomplish things once you learn how to master your dreams there's no end to what you can do\nIs right to me and I think that here's here's where our current understanding of dreaming and currents physics or meet up I mean the our current under staffed by kinda understanding I mean the really ready to revive some guidance and understanding about dreams of dreaming is traveling for example\nA physics tells us science tells us that we have access at any moment so the mentality of non local mind we're the field of information quantum field of information that contain everything we could ever possibly need to know and we have access to it\nAccording to our ability to harvest the information and do something with it and ... in the first place what's going on I think in dreams we discovered that we have ... do weights into this whole quantum information field\nAnd depending on the work and play with prepared to do with the information they getting we can bring through more and more I mean you can set an intention any night for example to be very simple about this they simply practical you can do dreaming basement beans use at an intention\nTo get guidance on any theme that interest you in probably something will come through if you don't think you've got anything you're awake in the middle of the night to reset your intention and maybe at this point\nYou're ready to list the dream on that subject as well because you've got some rest and you're ready to take off\nAnd it's amazing how many creative solutions come through in this way and they've come through across history a lot of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of Stuart narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine\nHistory one of my book the secret history of dreaming is full of narratives from the documentation that suggested dreaming is actually a secret engine in the history of everything in the history of credit breakthroughs in science and technology in the aughts\nEven in business and economics as well so when you say that if you wake up to what dreaming is it can take you anywhere you are literally correct it really can\nYou can take us to the hidden dimensions of reality that super string theory positive\nIt can take us into the off the lights there you see the hand\nWalked the job opportunities and living environment a like a beyond death so you can talk to an ancestor beloved loved ones and ... and others so this is the mentality of adventure killing guidance and possibility that opens when you become a more conscious ...\nWhat about the ability to chime travel in your dreams\nWhat we do it we do it whether we know it or not they do it even if we don't remember our dreams and I think it's a basic survival function of dreaming\nYou know if I'm a mistake on a practical mystic George I think you know that I Want to take away some of this that in power out everyday life and one of the things I Know from my own life and those I work with is the dream show you the future in a way that is actionable mean this is very important dreams show us\nOpportunities and challenges that lie ahead there with us as the things we don't yet know about\nThey can save your life they can save your job they can say that marriage I couldn't be talking to you today\nIf I did not know to show that I have that I have avoided death on the road predates with death in fatal accidents\nBy coming back from dreams that forecast what was happening harvesting the information acting upon it so I didn't have that head on collision with\nThe Eighteen wheeler coming down the hill to file on the other side of a blind\nSpot for example so that's one direction for time travel all the time doesn't move into a new one direction and in fact to\nUnderstand what our relationship with the time is through dreaming we have to know that in dreaming we step out of Libya time altogether we stepped into a different place and in between place from which we can access time passed future or parallel so you may discover that in your dreams your getting really interesting experiences of\nWhat's going on in other times altogether in those parallel times are the leading a power life this becomes very interesting when you begin to look at gifts and lessons you might have learned in a parallel life that you can apply and you present life and how to avoid things went wrong and not that other parallel life\nAnd it gets very interesting when you discover that you can go back to younger period of your life and reclaim something you lost at that time\nWill be guide to that younger self or you find yourself also in the lives in situations of people in ...

Robert ... with us his latest book is called mysterious realities how many books have you written Robert\nThis is the tragedy fifth of the old way George but I must tell you I'm getting nervous because I Dreamed sometime ago I have a life contract that says I have to probably sixty eight books\nOut on a show that that\nStill pretty prolific though good for you\nDream some time ago I have a life contract that says I have to publish sixty eight books\n[laughter] a short of that that's still pretty\nProlific no good for you good for you and they're ... they're all fascinating works\nThese dreams are so important I mean I I think people can you make themselves healthy in a dream that can get a better job in a dream they can make other people think about them by concentrating on them and dreams it's amazing what you can do a dreams isn't it\nAbsolutely and your list and some really interesting areas for example in terms of our hope\nI mean one of the things going on in dreams of that that body talk as well as sold tool in other words and dreams we see what's going on inside the body and old fashioned doctors\nUnderstand this and in traditional Chinese medicine for example this is front and center the idea is that a dream like gives an X ray even an MRI of what's going on inside the body might show it's symptoms that are developing might enable us to avoid those symptoms but\nThat's one of the functions of framing and the and in terms of our emotional and spiritual health\nI'll dreams which shows the things that help us to get wild him to stay relevant ended with acting up on those dreams and try and bring their energy through you mentioned connecting with other people were United telepathy which literally means fellow feeling at a distance or or or being in touch with someone else\nIt's a common phenomenon and dreams in fact it's surprising that more people who are related to each other either by Lovell by family or by common colds or whatever\nI'm not aware more often that they might be dreaming with ... and all of each other I mean there's a phenomenal shed dreaming or interactive dream you know which we find ourselves sharing adventures with friends and other people I mean this was another fascinating phenomena and dream\nAs a matter of fact you discover if you wake up to your dreams remember more of them look at what's going on\nBut you have what used to be cold and it's been cold again super normal capacity that are abnormal they're not supernatural but that'd be on the normal and we're talking about things like pre cognition\nUntil after the ... and and so on and and and and you are able to see things before they happen very seep into the distance but I go to connect with other people and these are natural powers and abilities that belong to you and if you become a more active dreamed that you'll find that you are growing in developing these gifts and the very helpful in life\nIn terms of creative solution for things dreams will deliver them if you can't find a solution to a problem or relies put the question to your dreams and see what come and I would add to that that you can do this in everyday life as well because dreaming for me it's not just about what happens when\nYou close your eyes is what happens when you open your eyes wider so part of this part of part of the fence with all this is that the world around you once again we'll speak to like a dream if you pay attention so I encourage people or many of my story is done on this\nTo notice what goes on in the amazing moments of meaningful coincidence when you've got a photo preoccupation on your mind and suddenly the will delivers an incident or sign king\nThat gives you not only a reflection on what's on your mind but sometimes a way of dealing with what is on your mind if you have an issue in your life one of the games I encourage people to play is\nPut your question to the world go down the street are going to the talk of going your morning commute without question in your mind and received the first unusual unexpected thing that enters your field of deception as a message from the use of the surrounds you it is amazing how specifically\nWorld will speak to you bring a dream like message when you play that game\nIn Nineteen Seventy one Robert I did my first radio audition tape in it and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid\nNeal audition tape and ... and I had it on tape and I dropped it off at a few stations in Detroit hoping that somebody would listen to this young kid and hire them to be some radio person those street reporter\nAnd ah what I Would do when I dropped it off at a certain radio station I wanted to work at I concentrated on that person every night when I went to bed or he already had my tape I hadn't heard from him\nA mature enough after two days I'm going to sleep concentrating on the individual\nI'm visualizing what he looks like I had met him one time and I'm sure enough two days later the guy calls me and says hey I liked his tapes and I've got something for you come on down it works doesn't it\nYes while you're send to Europe be met and your manifested George I'm not surprised one bit you know Mark Twain staged experiments of this guy he called them mental calligraphy back in his day when people said telegrams\nHe'd make a habit of writing a letter or an old fashioned telegram to someone he wanted to be in contact with an not mailing it he just right on\nAnd on that person and noticed what followed the news that that actually almost didn't solidly that was a response so you're practicing a game that is an angel game and it works I mean we know the thoughts are already thing they're already thoughts and feelings already action\nAnd if you're thinking about another person you're probably going to reach them unless they shielded again being reached a menu of reaching a but nine right to do something good we wouldn't want to be open to be reached by just anybody with with any intention but that's a lovely creative and benign example of sending a mental sending medical ... is what Mark Twain\nAnd I you know I subsequently used it a lot by doing the same technique since almost as if they have this inbox that you get on the same path with and you drop your little messages in there and then just for some reason they pick it up\nYeah yeah\nWe'll we'll do a little experiments of my groups by which one of those degrees the bell said to him it just might be a painting it might be a sculptor it's a non announced image to the group and people have the gas in the morning after the night of sending walk the walk the image that was being sent\nMight it be and it's interesting how that works and some people are very good at picking up and some people about ascend to another but this is just a focused example of something that we do automatic they were connected with each other where ... where in into weaving field of interaction and it goes on in ... all the time\nRobert you've talked about synchronous city explain how that ties into our dreams\nWell I think it's like this way me go dreaming once we understand that dreaming might be traveling we get out there we go beyond the cook ... or re I'm standing in a consensual hallucinations and we get into a deeper space we have encounters with people who live in a deeper space including\nOf powder than our ancestors through synchronous today we often feel that forces and intelligence

season in one of the greatest ways to do it is to treat yourself to a new radio or somebody you hear about from sea crane what I Need a radio with the best reception an audio that's who I turned to she crane\nBecause they're always there for you they know radio they continue to make good products\nBecause she crane loves radio to the CBC Radio too we is the best I Am and FM radio and with the two week you can hear our show for example with amazing clarity the CBC Radio too we is designed to receive long range a month after um reception and make those weak signals stronger\nThe high quality audio from the CBC Radio too we can be adjusted as well you get great voice clarity even even for music it's really something supporting the troops radio that has the ability to bring in those stations crystal clear and you get that put the CBC Radio to eat from she crane\nI look up and I see this thing come over that looks like a cell phone upside down with one big light in the middle for on each corner and I realized that I'm In trouble all of a sudden and as soon as I turned to run away\nUm I Know that I'm gonna get hit with either a mess or\nSomething like ... or something like that and but I mean but I was a kid so none of this made any sense to me at all but now we have drones\nRight so a ton of us drones are going to become a reality where they don't even have to employ soldiers or whatever\nI'm saying well let's get let's get Robert ... take on some of those rubber what do you think how many damn\nWell it's possible that you would dreaming of future developments in technology and in other ways that might amount of this sounds as if you haven't run into these situations in ordinary on at the yet and hopefully you weren't\nBumped it's perfectly possible that you had long range pre cognition in dreams of situations that might develop in life it's also possible\nBut the dreams have a symbolic made no ... but the symbolic me if I'm dreaming of of of the situation that seems very serious and talk and threatening going across the Koran stumbled and seeing this may be EMT\nOkay maybe that symbolic of some things that lies ahead to me in life which is going to have the emotional flows being emotional pools but something like that maybe my dreams are actually coaching me the pairing me forward emotional situation\nWhich are not all the situation which I Need to be ready I didn't know but that comes to my mind\nThe upside down cell phone you know I just want ... holding that image I realize it might be something larger more scary than a cell phone but I wanted to reach into bed dreaming ... be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean this this is the way that I Am about dreams I'm so\nTo that dream and grabbed up so they let it be a cell phone and speak on it and see who's on the other end I mean this is the way that I Am about treats I probably wouldn't you rather liked the idea of the upside down cell phone yeah it's scary but if it's my dream my actually however many years since the dream I didn't want to reach into the dream ...\nAh hold it to my ear and say who is that talked to me a while you and see what I get it might be that it's the kind of phony what you can talk to someone on the other side of death in our dreams where often people are often talking to the dead on phones are receiving phone calls from the amount of sort of want to go in that direction with that tree\nRobert wire dream sometimes convoluted and mired in a confusion in a terrible and things like that why isn't that just so obvious\nWell I think that actually that the dream sauce or the dream sauces I mean many sources of freedoms and try to communicate as clearly as possible but but not necessarily not enough to follow all of this\nAh and also we need to remember the dreams are experiences that whatever report we we quote to each other from a dream is only a report it's not the full experience so it might seem convoluted all confusing or not ... but that might be because we'd only brought back a few things from the dream and don't know how to put them together which is why\nI find the best way to understand a dream is to try to get your head back inside to try to get back inside the tree take a look at what is really going on when you do that you pretty quick you determine whether it's literally symbolic you can fill in some of the get\nYou learn the technique of cream reentry of going back inside a dream I I and once we understand that I think one of the songs you were playing though something about living a whole life\nYeah play implicitly in your dreams I mean once we understand that we're having tremendous experiences\nAnd couldn't live days or weeks in a in a dream in a few minutes to talk time looking to get into ... whatever we bring back to the dreams only partial and may be confused we might need to go beyond office memories of the tree and bring back more in order to understand what's going on\nOne is more prevalent Lucia dream free cognitive dreams just normal regular dreams what pops up the most\nWell a lot of people a dance scene yet to understand how to come to loosen dream is the idea of lists of dreaming of become very popular in that movie inception and the ideas how to you can make love to anyone in your dreams and you can be Superman that set for said that you know sort of adolescent quality to some of the\nThe the fads to loosen dreaming but listen dreaming is actually easier than most people make it to themselves when they try and memorize ways of wake you up that you're breathing inside of dream look at your hand and see if you can stick a thing go through your um that kind of stuff as I said earlier the easiest way to become looser treatments to start up loose that stay that way\nSo I didn't know how common listed breathing is amongst the population of the moment\nAt the moment I Do know that probably everybody is having pre cognitive previous but only a few people are aware of that yet only a few people have woken up to it I think it's it's routine I think that we do in the night whether we know it or not scout ahead of us felt some aspect of consciousness checks out what lies ahead I think that's going on all the time but\nI think many people have yet to wake up to the fact that they can do it and could use it so regular dreams what regular dreams of people I mean the dreams than a whole spectrum they are big dreams are little dreams that little room sort of rather routine processing of what went on the day before commentary on how you said yourself and how fast you ate the night before and then there are the big dreams\nWhich of the dreams which you feel that you had received a message for those you might kill yourself the president of the highest dose of wisdom oh you're gone travelling you know you've gone too distant galaxy or different time period or a place where the dead or alive so the\nPoint is that all of these ...\nYou know you've gone to a distant galaxy or different time period or a place where the dead or alive so the point is that all of these avenues of knowledge an adventure open to everyone all the time the only thing that prevents you from getting in on this\nIs is perhaps your reluctance until now to make time in your life to amend the more of what's going on in the night to write it down keep a journal that's basic practice keep the journal writer don't give it a title notice you're feeling around the experience to run a reality check asked\nWhether this could happen in the future once you're willing to do some simple things like that you're on the way to becoming a more active treatment unifying it's getting to empower and ... and those sorts of ways\nTo go to Thomas in ... California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call Robert great work that you are doing you know I wanted to tell me Robert I'm you know you talk about you know we get tired at night we close our eyes when we go to sleep\nWe have dreams and in those ... mentally travel ... maybe even mentally time travel\nBut then tonight us over we open our eyes and is it possible you imply that is that we are stepping from one dream state to another that we are stepping in\nProm night\nTo oh why king dream during the day\nA dream and watch reality as maybe plastic malleable I'm ... ... where we can not just mentally travel mentally time travel but actually like the ... men and women around the world\nPhysically travel and physically time travel because they are aware that\nReality as a white can dream as opposed to a night during I was wondering if you comment on that you seem to have all of that I\n... I Love your statement Thomas yes I think we do step when we come out of the freedom of the night into the dream of the day I think we do step from one stage unconditional treat me into another one I think the\nWaking life is also a dream in reality you might be more plastic and now the bulls and we make a loan full we talked about earlier about how your your your tensions the energies you carry the attitudes you carry good a shape you'll reality\nThe physical possibility of time travel or shape shifting et cetera is of course is is has beat on to debate among scholars and scientists and and their traditions of it in different so many lineages as you imply whether time travel is a physical possibility\nEither for certain kinds of primal showman or with the technology of the future I don't know but I Do know I mean I don't know from my experience I don't think I physically stepped from um time into another though I felt very very much on the edge of the sometimes\nI don't know whether the shapes shifting in the way the Germans connect with animal spirits central is physically possible for those people today but I Do believe it probably was physically possible in the earliest stage of human evolution when the human animal divide was not as ... is today\nBut anyway leaving aside those are areas which sounds to me to think about and the stumps of good stories\nI'm absolutely certain that you are right when you say that to come back from the dream of the night in the day is to move from one stage of\nDreaming to another actually I often feel Thomas divide step from ... from one room into another from one landscape all from one willed into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that in that reality\nInto another from one landscape or from one willed into another I have a sort of just so feeling okay I was there doing that that reality now I'm back it as the body and the bad\nI get it out of bed I go out in the street and I try not to forget that we might have more opportunity as we go out in the street or out in the day to change things for the better and make healthy choices and to participate in the construction of reality that

noticing some trains\nThat seemed to have a scene with moving parts it's clear that this moving parts and what kind of compare this to say like the second half of the Titanic movie where\nA DiCaprio

the relationship so the idea of a dream showing moving parts\nAnd my second thing just as you talk and now I was thinking of a I had played a lot of basketball and I never focused on jumping and I
