repressive you're nervous about these these Middle Eastern countries\nIn how we can fight back he's also been selected as one of the seven financial heroes by money magazine back in two thousand nine and here he is back on coast it goes Alan welcome back my front\nYard it's great to be with you\nHave things changed since the last time we talked about student loans or they've gotten worse I bet\n[laughter] well yeah they they have indeed uh gotten worse uh we're probably at it and I think I was on about a year ago so we've added around maybe a hundred and twenty five billion onto the tab\nWhich is now a sitting officially it about a one point five trillion um but quite frankly it's certainly a significantly higher than that even still with a lot of loans that that don't get counted\nWell let me ask you about the scam first of all you know if you go and buy a car and it's thirty five thousand dollars you know you've got an option here and that is I'm going to buy that car for thirty five thousand or I'm gonna walk away and look for something else\nWhy do you call the student loan situation a scam when nobody's forcing these kids to take these loans to go to school\nAnd I know what you're going to say but I got to ask you that\nWell no it's it's a fair question a and you know in the case of automobiles we have Lehman laws right if the school provides a you know if they if the car doesn't work then you know we can take it back well obviously that option doesn't exist for student loans [noise]\nUh but what is really missing from student loans that people I think probably many if not most of your listeners aren't aware of uh is that nearly every fundamental consumer protection that exist for every other type of loan\nHas been stripped from student loan for example student loans have no bankruptcy writes a there are no statute of limitations are uniquely for student loans a fair debt collection practices truth in lending laws these things have all been restricted or remove\nSpecifically for student loans and most\nUh most blatantly for federal student loans George so the feeling was that the federal government makes are the ones that are most apps and of the consumer protections that I just mentioned\nWhat what if they did something like this that they had a guarantee that a student in ah his or her chosen major uh would be guaranteed a job at a certain salary when they graduate and if they don't get that job for whatever reason the economy jobs aren't available\nThey get that discounted author student loan debt you know the ...\nYeah that's a that's a that's an interesting thought and in fact in some a first world countries in the nation\nOr something like that in fact happens Australia for example um you don't have to repay your student loans unless\nYou're making a minimal a annual salary I think it's forty thousand dollars or so [noise] um [noise] that could work a ... and you know there's a lot of pretty interesting ideas on how to pay for college out there [noise] uh but I can tell you that what we have now today\nIs the most predatory lending system that this country has ever seen a you know the founding fathers way back in the day\nUh people like Thomas Jefferson and George Washington they were being pilloried by British banks and merchants\nOr so after the revolution when when they wrote the constitution actually around the time of the revolution [noise] um they demanded uniform bankruptcy laws and they did this ahead of the power to declare war has the power to raise an army and many other very important powers [noise]\nAh so the founders you know are they require bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away\nAh so the founders you know are they required bankruptcy laws for a very good reason and this is exactly what's been taken away from student\nLoan absolutely we're going to take calls next hour with Alan in those of you who have student loans definitely check in with us and want to see how things have been manageable for you when you do that when you call it the student loan scam give me that definition oh\nSure oh well you know when it becomes financially viable in fact when it becomes financially preferable to the lenders for the bar or to fail to be able to repay the loan in other words to default on the loan\nWants to default no pets\nRight if it becomes more financially lucrative for them when a loan defaults rather than remains in good stead lots of defining hallmark of predatory lending system and we're seeing that throughout the lending system for the collection companies and the services and the guarantor ours\nAre often are the very same companies by the way they would much rather see a default than a loan the remains in good stead\nSo this is you know in stark contrast to even say credit cards where your credit card companies are thrilled if they get back even you know ten cents on the dollar on a default\nA but it turns out that ah the lending system can make far more than a dollar for every dollar paid out on a default in fact I'm all for a loan for federal student loan default and gets rehabilitated\nThis alone can easily double or triple and the agents that I'm compelled the borrower to what's called rehabilitate these defaulted loans they got a sixteen ... percent commission right off\nThe tongue allow [noise] so you know where they\nCan make the three hundred bucks over the course of ten years for servicing healthy loan\nThey can make ten twenty thousand dollars in a matter of four or five six years on a defaulted loans that they can build a bar or to put through rehabilitation\nAnd so the financial incentives that under this a federal student loans system are just completely perverted and it's been turn I mean really federal student loans have essentially been weaponized against the borrower\nKnowing spleen to process all the defaulted loan in how the lenders make more money how does that happen and let let's use a student loan four year college fifty thousand dollars as an example which is not unheard of\nAnd by any means so a student goes out borrows fifty thousand dollars or his parents are her parents borrow fifty thousand dollars and then they default one happens\nSure that's a that's a good case I'm good easy numbers to start with so I'm fifty thousand dollar student loan when the student graduates let's say they they give it their best shot and after maybe two two and a half or three years\nUh they're unable to make payments they\nLose a job or or whatever happens so with two hundred and Seventy days of non payment [noise] um the student can expect to learn to be thrown into default\nSo the fifty thousand dollar case that we're discussing here would probably default it's somewhere around ... let's say Seventy five or eighty thousand dollars what with penalties and fees and capitalize interests that are slapped onto that loan very quickly that would escalate to say a hundred and Fifteen twenty twenty\nFive years in the ball or is responsible for that\nYes yeah the borrower will begin getting demand letters for payment and fall for roughly let's say a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars\nOh my God so what the ... what the lending system will do will say oh you're into fall on your loan\nSay a hundred and twenty five or so thousand dollars oh my God\nSo what the ... what's the lending system will do will say oh you're into fault on your loan big trouble you know the federal government has all these Orwellian collection a power as we can follow your for the rest of your life [noise] we can garnish your Social Security check you know you can't run you can't hide we can get you\nFired from your job if you work in public employment we can have your professional license suspended we can even have your driver's license suspended in some states\nIt'll be taxed too you stuff like that\nThat's right yeah um you know your income tax returns will be garnished et cetera so huge amounts of power that none other no other lending system has are brought to bear on the bar or\nSo ultimately they will wind up ... um hopefully the government hopes I'm going through a loan rehabilitation so this is where they make payments for about for ten months typically none of those payments\nGo towards the loans just goes directly into the pockets of these third party agents that oh Tate this rehabilitation\nAt the end of the process they wind up signing for a much a new are much larger loan say a hundred and forty fifty thousand dollars well these agents again is sixteen percent commission on the value of that new loan so in the case of this fifty thousand dollar bar or\nThese agents that that compel them to do this alone rehabilitation get a paycheck for what what would that be sixteen thousand plus it's about twenty four thousand dollars goes directly into the pockets of the servicers\nFees and the ... these agents are collection companies\n[noise] well yeah these agents are typically I'm large sort of conglomerates and there's four of them they're Sallie Mae navy and there's ... there's the ... systems agency [noise] uh and there's Great Lakes but there are others as well um these\nThese companies own servicers they own collection companies and they also own Gehring tours so they also have a lot of legacy student loans from back in the day before a President Obama\nSo these companies make out like bandits they would far rather see alone that goes into default rehabilitate than\nAh than alone there remains is good said and I should probably say here George to all the people listening out there do not rehabilitate your loans it's a horrible idea a according to Moody's these defaulted loans that rehabilitate they default again\nThree to four times and they just keep growing\nOh that's right yeah and if you can imagine say that hundred and fifty thousand dollar rehabilitated loan if that default again\nThat are often worse than the original disease or condition check out\nThe cruel articles videos doc wallet can pharmacist men recordings at

once said there are two ways the cocker and in slavery nation one is by the sword the other is by debt and you sure have that with the student loan debt so Ellen if somebody gets sued for not paying their student loan or they're going to lose in court ... there's no way to win is there\nWell what happens more often than you would think George is they will receive a summons from a an agent of the federal government and maybe they get it maybe they don't if they don't get the sun and then they become subject\nTo arrest show in the state of Texas for example in around Houston one of the federal district there people are literally being hauled out of their homes by swat teams why and and and forced to ah to come into court that way\nTo deal with their student loans I kid you not\nDo you mean if they're not properly served by a process server as the sheriff or a private process serving ... company if they're not served ... you're\nThat can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court well that in ...\nServing ... company if they're not served ... you're saying they can go and get them anyway and take them in the ... in in the court\nWill that indeed is what is happening in the state of Texas certainly [noise] uh in just this one federal district or they had plans on arrest gene between Thirteen and I think Fifteen thousand people [noise]\nUh the one case that we know about ah the gentleman had an original I think it was like three thousand dollar loan and they hold this guy and literally with a SWAT Team and uh they wouldn't let him out until you agreed to pay something like seven or eight thousand dollars\nWhich included you know penalties interest in court costs and fees for the federal marshal and the court et cetera\nUm that's debtors prison back again\nWell that's right you know the the founding fathers or even people like Thomas Jefferson\nFlirted with a debtors prison James Wilson actually spent time in debtors prison a that was what the founders were trying to avoid when they wrote the constitution and demanded bankruptcy writes ahead of the power to declare war power as an army but it looks like we're sort of headed back in that direction at this\nGod that's crazy now does anybody have any recourse\nSo let's say that they're having trouble paying their student loans they all fifty thousand now they want to pay them fifty let's assume that's what they want to do\nWhat you're saying because of the default the fifty becomes a hundred and Fifteen thousand and if they default on that and grows even more can't they just cut a deal under fifty\n[noise] well um they can and here's the deal I'm [laughter] it's really no deal at all um the federal government typically will settle on a defaulted loan if the borrower pays one hundred and twenty percent the value of the loan at the time that it defaulted\nWhat kind of settlement is for\nMost people it's a completely unworkable settlement you know if people were having trouble paying on their loans in the first place\nUh to think that they can write a check for a hundred and twenty percent of the value of the loan default is free unrealistic for most people [noise] uh so that you know the the government has got you where do they want you on these student loans\nThey're essentially is no recourse and that's why I started student loan justice dot org so many years ago\nYou know I had worked in government lending in other areas and I had never seen anything like that\nUh you know this this student loans system really just made my jaw drop and um I think the founders are looking down and shaking their head at this point you know this is exactly the sort of situation they wanted to avoid this was the sort of tyranny that that was thrown down on us by the queen [noise]\nAh so I can only hope that the people out there listening who this is happening to realize that you know this is our our constitution that's a ... a truly at stake here\nAre you seeing that also people are losing their licenses driver's licenses because of defaulted loans\nYeah there was about sixteen states with laws on the books now that give them the authority to a recent revoked suspend a professional licenses driver's licenses and across the board people who um who work under federal programs\nCan literally be fired a from this public employment ... for the case of default to student loans this cannon is happening as we speak\nDoes this cross a park party politics I mean what did President Obama do about it what has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes\nWhat has President Trump tried to do about it are they doing anything about it\n[noise] it absolutely crosses all party line so I mean this goes way beyond Democrats or Republicans\nAre unfortunately the past say three presidents really has only made the problem worse under Obama Obama essentially federalized the lending programs so that where before\nA bank such as was mentioned at the top of the show a great legs Sallie Mae cetera where they were making the interest on the loans now the federal government makes the interest on the loans and by the way the federal government profits something like Seventy five billion dollars a year\nWhich is more than any corporation on earth on the lending program\nNow Donald Trump solve this and actually decried the fact that the government was making such an obscene profit on student loans you know before he even ran for president shortly before he said why is the government property not student loans this nonsense you know of all the places that the government shouldn't be making a profit\nYou would think student loans would be it a and indeed this sort of echoes the the words of President Lyndon Johnson back in Nineteen sixty five\nYou know when the higher Education Act was first signed into law and these loans or the lending system was created President Johnson said you know these loans will be free of interests\nWell how far we have fallen from those uh those days\nI'm so unfortunately you know those ... don't Trump's rhetoric was really good but since he's been in office he's done this as bad or worse than any of than Obama certainly than than Bush before him\nA et cetera so would Donald Trump is hired someone named Betsy to boss who herself had stock in going collection companies [noise] ah and you know frankly I don't think President Trump is really even thought about the student loan problem for more than about twenty seconds\nOr so I have I hold out some hope for him a but at this point I have to say he's been he's been as bad as the previous presidents\nPrior to Nineteen Ninety eight you could do a file bankruptcy in white folk to students that what happened\n[noise] well that's right uh so what happened was um [noise]\nSome of the people who were very well connected in Washington and they saw the money make making potential here they lobbied Congress\nAnd they tried it out these very rare examples of people who you know went from graduation to bankruptcy court and they said look at what the students are doing and we can't have this we have to take bankruptcy away\nAnd so um so yeah Congress ah ... ah took away bankruptcy rates in in Nineteen Ninety eight they became essentially permanently unavailable\nWhat we now know though Georgia's that back when they said this was happening far less than one percent in fact about three tenths of one percent of students were actually discharging their loans in bankruptcy and this is less far less than the average for other loans\nSo there was never a good premise for removing bankruptcy rights are and the fact that we've had to suffer under this big government predatory lending program for so long\nIs really one of the most one of the most vicious ironies of this whole thing of ... this is a problem that Congress should've fixed many years ago and that they haven't yet is just a true crime against the citizens\nWere with Alan Collins is one sided student loan justice done or linked up and goes to goes damn dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of nation\nThere's one side of the student loan justice dot org linked up and goes to goes damn dot com his book is called the student loan scam you're on some kind of nationwide tour these days tell me what you're doing\n[noise] oh that's right um you know thankfully we have a bipartisan bill in Congress has called H. are twenty three sixty six [noise] uh and this bill would simply um delete the one line of federal code that make student loans treated differently from all other loans in bankruptcy proceedings\nSo this really gets to the core of the problem and ah by by getting this bill passed\nA we would immediately see a dramatic decrease in the price of college\nAh we'd see a dramatic increase in the quality of college and I should say the quality of the job that the government does administering the program a so this bill is very important and we're hoping very much that Congress might pass this before the end of the year when the session expires\nWhen you want a spot that burglar when he's case in your home or after his head asked John who's blink camera alerted him a burglar tried to break in while he and his

Gordon in Lakeland, Florida have already go ahead\nThank you for taking my call 'em I Want to publicly think Alan he's the one that pointed out to me\nThat the lack of bankruptcy protections encourages predatory lending um and of course a tuition inflation I I already knew that the more you subsidize the loans especially the taxpayer on the hook 'em it's going to crash the dollar by the way because almost ten percent of total debt is college did\nOkay I already knew the bill Bennett hypothesis but now there's one thing they don't want to mention and that is the ... I'm a conservative everyone knows\nThat I'm the guy that almost won I lost a four to three\nSplit decision in the saddle case I'm pro life pro gun I'm a far right conservative it Rush Limbaugh and most of it's not even the liberals want a free hand out okay but the college tuition is technically and legally attacks because there's money going into an arm of the state government college and were being over tax that ... it wasn't real it's a matter of fact\nThe private colleges about ten times when you adjusted for inflation what it was back in the fifties and here's the thing okay we spent a lot of money on our military and it it's too much really we spend a lot you know even ads\nAnd here's the thing okay we spend a lot of money on our military and it it's too much really we spend a lot in you know even as a conservative we spend a lot of money on Social Security but we can only ... those things a little bit\nThe on the third or fourth thing is probably the tax dollars are being used to make er Yankee college loans and we don't need to spend any money of that not only does it the tax dollar on the hook and it's going to crash the dollar like Greece remains a whale of Georgian and I'm Alan by the way\nI'm Alan was good enough to make me the leader of the Florida group and I hope I he's gotten on an equal talking a little too much [laughter] but I don't miss an eye\nAnd all of the reason if here's the deal OK almost\nTen percent of the tone that his college debt and it's going to crash the dollar that the only thing if we get rid of the letter and get a credit card Idaho okay with loans but let them get a credit card it'll save the tax dollar\nAnd it'll save the standing with college will drop like a rock and the I Love I Love my rich man 'cause I'm a conservative and they provide jobs in hospitals and police looking here\nIt can get and I and I would vote for Trump if I had a chance to get a look and he can get bankruptcy repeatedly for millions in bailout and handouts\nEnd up all these rich banker in these colleges can get the rent on the students looking here ... that that that those are the two beneficiary in here and\nThen okay and they use the third or I we got your point there ... Allen\nYou know I I he said a lot there but I appreciate all those points and he's exactly right you know if we can throw seven trillion dollars into Afghanistan and Iraq\nI think we can throw maybe a trillion or so at the student loan problem but but more importantly from conservative point of view you know if the government was to drop out of the lending system tomorrow I think on balance that would probably be a good thing it would return prices\nBack down to rational levels uh and you know it would it would um really clean out a lot of the sort of socialistic uh nonsense that's been allowed allowed to creep into the system but ... but in particular it would it would lead to lower prices\nWill you do with all the debt right now Alan would you are just a white dude clean\nWell I Will say that if you had a minimum bankruptcy protections are not restored so that people can go to a judge and according to the wisdom of a judge I'm settled that debt according to their means\nIf that does not happen then we're looking at something like a full on jubilee soon you know the Democratic and I'm a nonpartisan guy but I Will say that uh the Democratic socialist particularly in New York are starting to win elections on the promise of canceling all student debt\nAnd [noise] you know I don't think that is maybe the best solution because there are you know forty percent of the people are out there\nAre able to successfully repay their loans but that is exactly what we're looking at very soon if at a minimum of the bankruptcy writes that the founders demanded aren't returned\nWell then you do have salaries teacher salaries and things that you have to keep the university going which should be reasonable right\n[laughter] yeah that's right um you know my best estimate\nIs that the colleges are so flush with cash right now there are so badly overcharging their students by and large they could probably suffer eighth thirty percent if not forty percent reduction\nIn the student loan income that they're currently receiving and still be able to keep their doors open not apt to lay off one person a and you know be able to service all the students that they do today so I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia\nIt's all the students that they do today so I think there's a lot of capacity there for price reduction in academia\nUm so yeah I mean ending the student loan program tomorrow would I agree probably be pretty devastating to a lot of schools [noise] um but certainly there's got to be a middle ground you know and with bankruptcy back with the department of education having to contend with the same bankruptcy laws that every other lender has to contend with [noise]\nAh that would go a long ways towards compelling them to crack the whip on the schools to lower their prices improve their quality and decrease the amount of time that the students are having to stay in school now to get a degree\nFirst time caller mark in Provo, Utah Marco head\nWell George you said they can't uh they don't force you to take student loans but when I started school I was on a full scholarship they've been paid for my books but the federal government makes you go to a student loan counseling and so I went\nAnd I told the lady I'm I don't know why I have to even be here among full scholarship and she told me Will Hunting if I were you I Would borrow as much as you can put it in the bank and earn interest on it\nOh boy I Would love to sue her this did you end up doing that\nOh yeah and then life happens the money disappears yeah you know over fifty thousand dollars just in interest on my student loans and loan balance is a hundred and three thousand dollars just lying gallon never pay it off I Will die owing money do they harass you mark\n[noise] no I'm right now they've got me on some ridiculous thing we're uh my payment is zero um I did a double major in a minor and ... some point I did need student loans but uh the irresponsibility um I just I I Would have never tasted that crack heads she not pedaled it\nTo me exactly exactly well what do you think Yellen yeah these these loans are\nPushed on the students way ahead of any scholarship or any other um any other aid that were you don't have to pay it back I mean the college and some of the colleges are making money on these loans by the way they're they're making these loans and then reselling them\nA private banks and so the colleges are in on the action as well and it's it's\nIt's just disgusting [laughter] hey you know I might actually out on the repayment program that that a mark is on a is probably the income based repayment program so they're a bunch of government programs out there that sound like they are forgiveness program so there's public service loan forgiveness there's income based repayment\nBut what all everybody out there needs to know\nIs that all of these programs are failing the vast majority\nOf people who try out for them so we now know that the success rate for the public service loan forgiveness program where you work for a you know if you work in a college or a hospital other nonprofit get your loans forgiven only about point three percent of the people trying for that forgiveness are actually getting it\nSo the rest are being disqualified and they're being left owing far far more so mark mentioned he was making zero dollar payments well interest continues to accrue on that loan so\nSo that loan is getting bigger and bigger and statistically speaking there's only about a ten percent chance that mark will make it through to the end of that I'd be our program and actually get the loans forgiven or and I might add that any amount for given under the I'd be our program is taxable income so\nTwenty five years you get a\nNice little ... center the IRS that says this is income for this year\nRight so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals or probably even exceeds the amount that you were in\nThat's right so at the end of the twenty five years you get a tax bill which probably equals right probably even exchanged the amount that you were originally borrowed [noise]\nAll the federal government is not some benign altruistic entity that is you know she can to help its citizens get educated the federal government particularly the department of education they are out to make a buck and they are making a\nWas gonna say they are obviously know how to make money don't think\nThat's right you know it was ironically it was ... acres that set up the office of federal student aid for and and currently run the federal student loan program these are people these are executives from Sallie Mae and many other student loan companies that that are running the place now so\nUh they are no public a benefit I'm inspiration they jettisoned all pretense of actually looking out for the students are many many years ago\nThank God I found

I'm a graduated from college to Fifteen just before it closed down\n[noise] I'm I'm One of those fortunate case who are at one point three to aloe with talking about that actually got um most cars that were given I uh got thirty four thousand of the thirty seven thousand that I got you know that\nBut actually got um most cars that were given I ah got thirty four thousand of the thirty seven thousand that I got you know that I owed\nForgiven wow how'd you do that and resolutions\nI appreciate that thank you well I I did a little bit of a heart away um there's something called a you'll binding\nAnd what that is is that like a lifting of pretty much like a course of your book or a trait that trade you chose yeah and what it is is um if it of course he'll uh the reason they're in a situation because they both by ...\nSo if you were from a certain time period to a time period at the end of the school I'm pretty much that's when they committed a that broader so it actually took me from\nI Would have to say December outlook they seem to around August of two thousand and fixing to get it all given what I did is I actually wrote Kamala Harris and email\nI'm surprised that we bonded um but the the avenue that I went to get all that are given to write a cover letter I'm I submitted a pretty much what the ... the political any on then I had to pretty much a political out but what I'd gone through no that that's the transcript to a\nA cover letter transcripts and pretty much all the information that I actually had to prove that I went to college\nYeah it was the fraud that got it reduced I guess right\nAh yes uh that's one of the main things I put there because if you see many of the college commercials what being a problem with this life long job placement of good so what how I false advertising\n... exactly so when the schools shut down there goes your call ... ... there goes your life like long up like but at the\nRight you got that right the interesting Alan isn't it\nYeah that you know and that's a good point and I maybe I should have brought up at some other point and show there is some breaking news now where if you went to particularly for many of the for profit colleges they get caught or why you mean just like the just like Paul mentioned\nSo they'll misrepresent their job placement rates and you know say oh you know average earnings for your degrees this much and these could be lies and so there actually is a rule that was put in place by the Obama administration where if your school ... ... you\nThen at least on paper you have available to you and avenue called defense to repayment where you\nLeast theoretically you can get your loans cancelled and I\nI think I'm Paul is probably one of the very lucky few that has seen does work successfully for him [noise] ah but I Will say that even just yesterday and I'm One of the federal court struck down an attempt by the department of education to\nSort of do away and slow walk this this program so as it stands now today there's a bit more hope for people who are light to buy their colleges are then there was a a couple of days ago um now I Can't say for sure what the results of this will be\nBecause believe me the department of education has no desire or intentions of forgiving anybody's loans if it doesn't absolutely have to uh you know under gunpoint practically by the legal community but [noise]\nUm but there is a bit more hope today than there was before so if you're you were lied to by ... for profit college or you may may may possibly have some avenue for record snow fall\nYou know with all these credit card fraud that's out there and just credit fraud indeed I mean if you get a letter from a collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the ... and they don't provide it\nA collection agency for some debt you don't even remember could be yours maybe it's ten Twenty years old if you ask them for a copy of the ... NATO provided to you they're up a creek aren't they\n[noise] well that's right and similarly for student loans we find a lot of private loans the underlying note uh well first of all the loan has been bought and sold so many times that whoever says they owned the note actually does not owned a note and they have no business collecting on that loan I'm\n... now there are other there are some avenues of the the lenders can go to they can say that the note was lost and they have other avenues to prove that it is a valid note but that certainly is something to be aware of\nAnd I should also say people who have private student loans are not federal student loans they do have statute of limitations so somebody comes up to Twenty years hence and starts demanding money from you for a private loan than almost certainly that loan is not\nLittle ... little there you suspect\nUm and you want to look into the statute of limitation laws that govern that particular alone depending on where you live or where you took up alone\nIt's going to pat Minneapolis east of the Rockies ... go ahead\nI worked in a Social Security office for a while and I figured out that at ... at least one of the agenda as is the destruction of the Social Security program because there are families with co signers\nGrandparents parents and students none of them are ever going to get a security forum\nI Want a question and I think Justin right if if I own a house\nAnd I have co signed on one of these student loans is that does that blame it on my house so that when I die instead of my air is getting at it's collected for a for a student loans\nThat goes to the lone first doesn't it\nWell that's a that's a great question hum to her first point\nYes Social Security wages are being garnished as we speak for student loans and what is even more disturbing I see legislation out there right now hasn't passed yet but I see legislation out there right now which offers a loan forgiveness in ah in return for people for going\nTheir Social Security when they when they reach retirement age ah so there are some people at work in Washington DC very busy trying to figure out how to\nTake away Social Security benefits down the road from student loan borrowers\nInteresting is that what did you have one of the things that you want to say\nFamily has already where multi generation the grandparents and parents are the kids are never going to get any thoughts as scary\nBut it just you know that if you have if you want to help the students and tear up the ... you write a check to the school or a money order or other travelers jak or whatever and a little kid whereas the you know says\nGet everyone peace of mind when they protect their homes their progress jumping for joy when I Walk by\nSaving averages Seventy percent on car insurance when you bundle home an auto through progressive BBC me\nNo attempt progressive casualty insurance company in a village discounts not available at all states are situation\nWhat do you every time you went out you can cash in now with the capital in the ... you are in four percent cash back on dining and entertainment like learning more about each other on your first date you painting or discovering can't hit the high notes that your favorite karaoke bar\nNo matter your reason for going out now you have four more intriguing in New haven cartoon capital one in four percent on mining and more present on entertainment once in your wallet terms applied capital one bank usa NA\nFrom the justice of heart ... studios ... you know Las Vegas ...

as if the momentum is waning what do you\n... when when you said the organization um he he you know\nRight yes I Am well that's very interesting question and the answer is no one knows because in in all of this\nThe U.S government has had forty two ways says in these sorts of situations I eat as little as possible\nAnd we we really have very few pieces of the puzzle from the government itself which is is pretty much profit because we don't frankly we don't even know where the eight tip is still an ongoing project\nI I think people like Lou Elizondo ran it of course say yes it is it still has its mission it's still continues he of course all though he's resigned from the Pentagon and still has has a lot of contacts and friends that he he says it's still going\nNow other people I think have disputed that and certainly we have been told that the\nFunding plug has been polled well I was on his head so ... doesn't matter you can continue a project\nWith you know using concurrent resources which is absolutely true uh but you know it is it is a mystery what I Do suspect that happened is if it is\nStill an extent program it was probably changed ... cold again this is typical government um alphabet soup\nTerritory we're not even a hundred percent sure about the name of of a tip Lou has said its advanced aerospace\nThreat identification program a Pentagon press office has said one time it's advanced aviation a threat identification program and then we learnt that\nA chip damned in part from another program called advanced aerospace weapon system application program so it's it's an absolute nightmare to try and\nFind out what the things even cold let alone whether it's still running and and you know that you're dealing with some pretty secretive stuff when they weren't even come clean about the name of the the program\n... that's true of course a big ... you know she's still funding a lot of projects\n[noise] again we don't know and the problem is that um we we know that the Robert Bigelow gosh\nI'm ... I was going to say through through um his his friendship with Senator Harry Reid but that's not that's not entirely correct and I don't want to do in this service here he'd be it for the ... contract quite quite openly in legitimately and through the the Santa contractual\nProcedure and he goes hey launch chunk of that a tip work but of course justice the the government requires that people sign their their secrecy oh it's\nSo Robert Bigelow and and um his organization had everyone and a non disclosure agreement so actually the people involved in this work what kind of um stone twice\nSo to speak they had they had to have government security parents but also the commercial non disclosure\nKind of I'm stung twice so to speak they had they had to have government security clearances but also the commercial non disclosure\nAgreement so so again there is a lot of this story that we don't know and that's the other thing in in aliens at the Pentagon and I've seen a lot of you know you pick up the the media um reports of this you go on to the blog some forums you see a lot of speculation\nI was always taught at the ministry of defense you know when I was doing analyst way for example and briefing\nYou must always differentiate between ... you know\nAnd what you think and that's not a skill that everyone practices when they they make films and documentaries but I Try to be rigorous on violence and\nAnd we don't even speculating I say I'm speculating and when I'm not I'm not so hopefully even though there are large parts of the story we still don't know I'm only ... where we don't know that these things\nWell what's the bottom line what [noise] what\nWell [noise] I I didn't want to I I don't want to get too far into spoiler\n[laughter] I I think one one thing\nThat I Can't say which I think gives a pretty good summary off\nOf what I think has gone down\nIs that I Would say there was and I use that would deliberately I Believe a faction if I can call it died within the U.S government\nAnd some of those people were permanent employees and some were can try and protests and this believe a fraction who the phenomenon was ... the real ... and and they were to write to not have ...\nDidn't entirely know what to think of it\nDidn't rule out the possibility that they were dealing with something extraterrestrial paranormal and actually then ...

I think he's where a lot of these conservative religious\nPeople get the idea of UFOs might be demonic\nAnd there were a lot of ... I Believe that\n[noise] yeah and and it it it's frustrating in a sense because and and it's almost comic clay ironic in another way that the ... you know you have a bunch of people\nIn in the Rio de da da and and in the u._k. and the ministry of defense you got a bunch of people who thought yeah this we're dealing with a real phenomenon and\nWe should be investigating it researching it in the proper scientific manner and we come up against skepticism and you might think well that's fine that's that's what you'd expect\nUm but that skepticism is the sort of clinic who are intellectual\nA human that skepticism that I think most people I associate with that concept it's actually it it's a deeply trying to leave for tripping skepticism itself I mean it to to have effectively the so called UFO skeptics in the end to give\n'em say that they don't they don't believe in extraterrestrials but they believe these things demonic while it's just in one sense it's swapping one arguably fringe belief for another so we'll at least by these people wouldn't skeptics are told\nThank God I found out in time no bank identity theft program or insurance protects you hold title luck will for pennies today who died along puts a barrier around your homes title and mortgage the instant detects tampering there on helping to shut it down find out if you're already a victim of title fraud\nGet your hundred dollar search free would sign up visit home\nTitle luck dot com home title luck dot com\nIs on used ... [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWell come back to close the cultural back with Nick Pope Mick do you think at all but the alien presidents appears to have any kind of threat to us as a human species\nWell this is a problem we grappled with a lot at the ministry of defense and fight the um law to oil in in the what's now when the ten year program to finally\nGo heavily into the question of whether there is or isn't a threat and how could you tell and who should make that assessment and in fact um it it gets quite\nFractious um between different divisions in the ministry of defense and and some of the the\nThat does make quite amusing reading as as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who to you\nLet's just make quite amusing reading\nAs as the intelligence people are telling some of the other people you know who do you think you are to suddenly put yourself into the role of of of an intelligence analyst and and you know ... that's not your job and um what what the intelligence people concluded\nThey they made a a kind of analogy um they said I'm a ... if you don't mind I've actually gone to document in front of me home gives some yeah this is a this\nActually hasn't officially been released yet\nI'm Will be tonight it will like\nI'm the same can them critical question is do you a piece represent a possible threat to the defense of the realm we could argue that assuming for the sake of the argument something exists\nThey have never shown any hostile attend intent and therefore kennel represent a threat however\nRussian act Croft attempting to penetrate the u._k. I defense reaching in the Cold War never showed hostile intent but they certainly represent to the threat is the only logical conclusion that we can come to is that we do not know if you ate piece represent a threat to the defense of the realm\nAnd so this this is quite interesting because ah parts of the the ministry of defense was saying to parliament the media and the public know there's there's no evidence of any threat here we we look at these things to see if that of any defense in ... but no no no threat\nAnd yet in June of ... they were trying to fight documents saying well look we just don't know we have not yet made a proper assessment and\nSo we we can't tell\nYou simply can't so well what about the alien abductions phenomenon I mean wouldn't that be some kind of\nIt would be if we could absolutely say that it's it's physically rail and not not some sort of combination of hoaxes and psychological delusions and\nAnd an other misunderstood phenomena the the other thing is of course we don't really know what's going on some of the people who claimed to have had these abduction experiences say that it's really really traumatic and and suddenly researchers like what Hopkins and Dave Jacobs\nWhere we're always saying you know the whole style and it's it's a threat on the other hand people like John Mack\nAnd and some of the other people who take him on new agents spiritual view of this talk about healing and things like that and it goes back to the idea of who who can really say I mean this sounds bizarre but in millet treat 'em there is actually in a way Asian\nFor I'm working out whether this is a threat to our knowledge or rather this this is a kind of them we don't know the values\nBut he didn't tell them some military circles\nWe say that ... is defined as being a a construct of capability plus intend\nSo so you look at the capability you look at the intent and then he would count whether this is a threat and if there is\nWhat ... what kind of a threat it is well we have some idea about the capability of ... and and again the the file the ministry defense files state quite clearly you know speeds maneuvers\nWay in excess of anything that we've gone so the capability we we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea\nWay in excess of anything but then we've got so the capability\nWe we know has a higher value what we don't have any idea about is intent if the if there is an intelligence behind this phenomenon frankly we don't know what it is we don't know what it once we it may be unknowable\nIn the u._k. the astronomer royal ... and race\nSpeculating about extraterrestrial intelligence and and uh gender and motivation said it may be trying to process to try and figure this out he said it might be the analogy would be trying to explain quantum mechanics\nAnd you find the well we don't know what it is we don't know what they want but can you categorically scenic that it's happening\nI Can't say that abduction is happening no I I don't know that\nWell I mean this is the nation's visitation\nUh well what I can say is that there seems to be strong and credible evidence that you a pay our rail that they do routinely penetrate are already defense\nRegion I'm In the u._k. the U.

may okay\nNicky with us yeah sorry I thought you were getting a hit me with ... two straight away\nWhile we're waiting for that will ... will now that they weren't one\nI'm now I'm going to sound a

about pilots carrying missing and and you eh fires and I think you know unfortunately flying is an inherently dangerous\nUm occupational certainly laws in in the early days and a lot of lot of action

being visited do you think most of them look like these so called de Leon grazed the people described or do they look like us what do you think\nWell it's tricky question because I think the media kind of might have that kind of\nTrump or me or whatever you call it of of the alien gray and then it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy because I think you know when people say oh I've seen one of these aliens gray large head\n... shaped it gets reported but when when somebody says they see something that doesn't quite fit the mold maybe it doesn't quite make the cod or get the coverage but in

thing flash up on him or whatever page opens when I open up my Internet browser and you know I tend to just kind of get off those pages pretty quickly 'cause they're always trying to sell you something\nBut um there was a comparison with the John Goodman showing him man no maybe five six years ago and he was a pretty big guy\nAnd what he looks like now and he's lost a ton of weight and I think the article was trying to hit that they're you know maybe there's a health concern or something like that um but you know when people who who go from you know being a large a person like that\nOr something like that um but you know when people who who go from you know being a larger person like that and then losing all that way can wait and when you see him for the first time it's kind of\nStriking you know because their their whole face to face looks different in their eyes are more pronounced is just to kind of struck me odd and I didn't realize um and I haven't seen him in a while I think the last time I saw anything he did was that movie clover field ... uh what was that ah yeah the hen or something yeah a filter and I don't think he lost any weight at that point\nWell I'm actually looking at a picture of them now and to be honest with you it doesn't look anything like himself it looks like a politician completely desperate I just as it were in a suit and it was like a\nFurther so they're all there goes my idea for a being John Goodman for Halloween 'cause I just want looked like him anymore with that that pseudo is going to put on\nYeah well I don't know I mean hopefully everything's okay with them and that how it so it goes I mean I mean when I when I was doing goes on ours um at one point I was like two fifty something and I dropped down ah I\nOh it's it's a pleasure to be here oh welcome to the show so let them\nLook to make sure that everybody's on the beach or help us out or tell us what oh a wiccan is start there\nSure I'm I'm going to say that uh the word is really brought nowadays and it probably doesn't narrow things down much more than saying ...\nIt's a whole family of a religious traditions that are derived from the folk traditions of Europe or in addition to edition of a western magical tradition\nAnd basically where the folks that celebrate the changes of the seasons and view all things as having spirit and believe in uh many goddesses and God's\nI'm often were called um witches and some people claim the title which is some don't but we are a pagan nature worshipers\nWell in which is just I mean it's like when you're when you're looking at Christianity you know for the top and then there's all these branches that come off of it right in right a lot of people don't realize that they think automatically on while you're you're wiccan and they know but what branch of right and argue\nWell ... and the other thing is that a lot of people who\nAre self taught or are exploring will call themselves wake and uh it's kind of like a catch all for being pagan are following an alternative religion it but you know when somebody says they're wiccan that's about as clarifying as somebody saying they're Christian\nExactly and and I bring up a lot on the show uh Wicca in paganism those are pretty much the oldest religions correct because anytime you're dancing around a fire for a good kill or these things that that would fall under that that paganism religion\nShort and I will say is that if if there's the name for the oldest religion it's the belief that everything is alive you know by if if you go back to the time when we were hunter gatherers or\nPeople that we're living off the land and nomadic primarily the one thing that was probably true that is that we believe that everything was alive\nAnd trees and rocks plans whether et cetera and and that still holds true in most forms of paganism where we believe that all things have their own kind of solar spirit\nWill and also the belief that everything is connected as well correct\nShore or you know we believe in the universe being one thing a we make believe in many gods and goddesses but the universe is one big place and entire thing is alive\nA better way of looking at is that everything that is as part of one spiritual energetic ecology with different kinds of beings filling indifference lots of nieces\nBut just like an ecology everything is connected and you can't have an impact on one area of it without it for breathing through the whole\nBrought up the word which is well or in your in your description of what might be and you see some people use that word is a part of the family or maybe as as they can almost ascending sending him in a way I'm\nIs they're just finding\nSome people use that word is a part of the family or maybe as as a dental assistant and sending him in a way\nIs they're finding are determining factor that would make someone call them so we can versus which\nWell or you can be a witch without being quicken a there are Christian which is there are a Hindu which is\nA there are people who don't necessarily believe in gods and goddesses but call themselves which is because ultimately for me and I'm going to say that you're going to hear many definitions many perspectives because\nWe don't have a any kind of system over forty where anyone sets the definition for what something is [noise] but my catchall is if if a person is a which\nThey are a tutu or open to working with the powers of nature and the powers of their own energy and the spirits\nTo accomplish things and that could be anything from a people calling for rain because there's a drought or people are standing above a friend that is in need of healing and calling upon different to powers and energies to make a change to bring about healing so\nIf you want a which is somebody who is actively engaged in\nMaking things different\nWhether that's a physical change or just a psychological change honestly it doesn't matter to me but it is a person who is trying to use their connection to that Web of every thing to bring things for\nYou like you said that you can view which without believing in God or God is can you be out a window or we can we now know ... you can\nIf you if you're wiccan then you've already a name to yourself as participating in a religious system\nA there are many gods and goddesses that people work with or vendor rate in America so that if you're using the word wiccan than it implies\nThat you also have a relationship to particular gods who got us of but you can be a which with out that\nThe gods and Oregon is is that we're talking about um for a week or are they singular is a one daughter got us or is it multiple gods and goddesses\nMultiple uh on one level I suppose there are some people that will argue that ultimately um all the gods and goddesses our faces of the whole universe or that all got us as our one got us but on the other hand you'll find lots of weapons who will\nYou know very clearly points out that there's a difference between how this particular got us for that particular God exist\nAnd I guess there's another way of looking at it because everything and the small is reflected in the large so for example in one hand we can argue that there is kind of like a a group soul or a group spirit that or a ... a tribe of spirit that we call all human beings\nOkay and yet every human being is individual and different so I'm the one so those are also human beings that are part of families and you could certainly see a family resemblance in either parents are in trades\nSo the same it can be applied when we think about gods and goddesses or spirits of different kinds from very large to very small um they can be very uniquely distinct at the same time that it at a deep level there profoundly connected\nWill end a lot of ... you know there's multiple gods for different things are ... multiple well yeah I mean you have your goddess of ah and do you guys also believe in some uh some believe in everything right down to the teachers\nSure you got us of a and I know you guys also believe in some uh some believe in everything right down to the nature of spirit and and things of that nature\nAbsolutely make elemental as we refer to them and I'm not sure do you guys in front of them as elemental as well\nElemental means a lot of different things everything from an artificial elemental that can be created a through through magical or were psychic means to elemental that are literally a connected to fire water or a ferret cetera\nTo beings that are ah you know a elements of star or or of of a cloud but you know but here's a better way of looking at it\nIf you let's go back to the ecology idea for a second if you look in ... I live in the woods and I'm very grateful and very privileged live across the state forest and if I Walk into the woods\nI Will see insects I Will see birds I Will see the tiniest little creatures crawling in the soil\nAnd I will see you know uh the occasional ... cat and everything in between because ... they're different sizes and different levels of individual patient intelligence if you will and I don't think that the world of spirit and I'm using that as a catchall\nTerm for everything that doesn't have the body\nGoes all the way from things as small as microbes to all the way as big as things that we called blue whales spirits and entities can exist\nIn every five and some of them can be as intelligent or more intelligent enough and some of us are perhaps this as as far as the groundhog in the backyard\nOkay and as a ... when we're dealing with yeah certain types of things a certain types of entities a lotta times we've dealt especially homes in the woods we've dealt with what we call elemental type activity in their little nature spirits and\nYou can kinda be tormenting but they're not really there to do harm they're more they're just trying to frighten you\nOut of the woods because that's their domain and yeah they're considered ... I guess protectors of the woods and and ah the streams and rivers and things like that\nAnd how about this uh and and in some cases less so nowadays because a human development is a pretty much torn up most of the major tracks of land and finding old growth forest or around here is almost impossible\nBut in in older and more to more fully intact areas you also find spirits that are the equipment the spirit equivalent to the local forest ranger\nThat are much more mobile much more intelligent than the smaller ones that are just trying to get you out of their territory\nAnd that's when you know and and that's where you decide well is this a nature spirit is this a something that is some people would call fate or ferry is this something that is a demi gods or if you want to go to the other mythology or the ways of looking at it\nWhat I Would say is that uh if you put a bunch of weapons from different traditions together the places where they would have commonality is in a lot of things that we said earlier a celebrating the solstice says the equinox is and the\nCross quarter days that fall in between having a work that involved both goddesses in God's believing in spirit of of of all beings\nHowever if you then started comparing what songs or chance to do or which order do you do which things in your rituals that's where it becomes different\nBut that part of practice or is it more like a stylistic differences\nThan it is court beliefs not that there are some profound differences for example\nA it has some traditions of there's the expectation of that uh people will um as for example in our tradition um the third degree is the level at which somebody is considered clergy\nUm we have absolutely no expectation that somebody who is the third degree a is obligated to form of confidence\nThey may decide that they want to be a researcher they made a sign they just want to teach or they want to uh investigate in some systems you don't go for a third degree you don't strive for that unless it is a understood that it will be then your duty to form of carbon\nSo so that there's a lot of differences are but you know what it it's kind of like what it looks like from a distance or if you were to sit down with\nIt's a lot of differences are but you know what it's it's kind of like what it looks like from a distance or if you were to sit down with a twelve different kinds of a Buddhist and there's more than twelve different kinds of Buddhist systems\nYou would listen twelve I mean could you know you guys are pretty similar to each other though from the inside it would feel like there are really distinct differences between all twelve\nSo part of it as a matter of perspective from the inside and the outside but there's a lot of commonality and there's a whole lot of a creative difference in how we express our our rituals and our ceremonies\nAnd do you deal with a lot of backlash from other religions more you're practicing\nYou know it it varies I mean there are [noise] uh\nI I've had a really good working relationships with clergy from other faiths and a month plenty of time for about a a collector about close to close to eleven years um we had a metaphysical shop or in the state capital and\nAt the same time I had a great relationship with the guy that ran the Sunday breakfast mission and look at a bunch of the other mainstream clergy\nThere were also the type that would at least once a week you know early in the morning you know try to get there before I open the door to the store and they're like inscribed being ah the sign of the cross him in a holy oil on our front door\nSo it's like anything else there is there's a mixture of people that are willing to just recognize that as long as people are reasonably good faith feel that they're it's good if they are different and there are others that regardless\nOf how much effort you take to try to reach out are the only thing you'll get back is that whatever you're doing it has to be wrong well mixed bag\nYeah well and it's tough to because I and I've been involved in many religions and I I deal with many religions out there and your religion it's I think a lot of people have missed interpretations of it\nAnd uh but there's a lot of religions out there that instantly just attack your your belief system your religion for whatever reason and it's just it's kind of sad that way\n[noise] sorry about that I have a very large dog [laughter]\nIt was just trying to take the dog the\nDog just jumped in my lap [laughter] I'm trying to figure out why are you still awake daddy yeah 'cause you know\nThe dog's not what time it is it when they want you to go to bed so anyway you know what I'll say about about a religious tolerance as long as humans have been around there's not been enough of it and it doesn't matter which century where and\nYeah I mean more people have died on this earth because of it then I think any other calls\nWell it's it's funny things words like love and religion that really should be good things um and yet a short lots of lots of harm and have been done in the name of religion and lots of harm has been done in the name of love\nAnd almost everything that is really something that should be treasured bike humanity is also got the right mixture of emotions to bring forth the worst\nYou know how many people identify themselves and how common is it for people to identify themselves as within\nIt depends on uh who's taking the survey uh I used to tell everybody that uh they're probably as many uh people that self identify as wiccan as there are Unitarian though I\nTell everybody that uh they're probably as many uh people that self identify as wiccan\nAs there are a Unitarian though uh I actually have a couple of friends that are academics that are some pagan in some laws that are doing research and it may be that there are more pagan now the U.S than there are a Unitarian so there was one reasonable gas I read\nThat or perhaps three million states\nThat are self identify some flavor of pagan I'm not going to say we can because that was the nature of the survey\nAnd it is one of the you know I Believe the fastest growing religion out there correct\nI think that people say that they are because\nIt's hard to keep track of the measurement of it it seems like it becomes easier to stumble across it in day to day life so certainly or it may be growing faster the things but honestly I think it's more that people are becoming a bit more open about it\nAnd that lends to the idea of it growing faster but it's I definitely think that various kinds of sadism are growing and I'd you know honestly I'm going to say a big chunk of it is simply the fact that\n\nIf you look around and if you want to to practice on your own you can practice on your own if you want if you're the kind of person that's drawn to being in groups there are groups that you can join but the biggest thing is that there is very little that is going to say\nYou must do the following things or you must believe the following things in order to be a good person\nThere's certainly a morals and ethics but there are a lot more nuanced and a lot more specific I mean we have members are in in our tradition that have been members for maybe twenty actually the person I'm thinking about it's been a member for over Twenty years\nAnd they still also go to a Unitarian church and a cage leave they will go to a Quaker Meeting because that's what they were brought up with and the differences we don't mind if they do those other things\nAnd I think part of I'm Sorry good\nI think we're we're we're we're fairly we're not we don't ask you to give up everything else that you are\nAnd I think part of the uh the the mass when you talk about the fastest growing religion I think that\nThe the probably the underlying number is the fact that when you look at 'em organized religion as a hole\nIn the United states anyway you'd been on the decline significantly for many many years um whether it's in your other organized religion so probably compared to that obviously if there's any gross it's gotta be you know sure are glad that standard it wouldn't be\nSo I'm One more question then we have to take a break you had to identify may be the end of the top two or three teachings\nOf your tradition of the assembly sacred we'll we'll but would you say they are\nWell [noise] um our job curious to reinvent the world and that means to view everything is being alive everything is how to use all everything is having spirit and\nTo believe that there are a connection between all things so if you view the world is actually being a chanted everything magical everything alive everything to an active it changes the relationship things aren't things to be used things are things to have a friendship or relationship or to honor\n\nInto pretty much just respect and so forth but if you treat\nIf you treat other things is is alive and having the\nAnd to pretty much just respect and so forth but if you treat\nIf you treat other things is alive and having their own volition their own agency their own existence then if you you have to treat them with respect because you see them as real just um\nWhether it's people are trees a lot of times we we treat each other like a natural resources to be used up\nExactly or or just you know demand goes junior uh we're talking well in a wiccan older and author and uh we're discussing a wiccan pagan paganism and the season of the spirit so are you listening
