don't think so um you know I think people's worries fall into two big buckets and one of them is what you mentioned which is 'em robots taking people jobs\nBut um other comes to my website you take to try to figure out if if your job is at risk\nAnd it it records all the answers and very very few jobs actually cut a robot take over I mean you try to just imagine one being a plumber or I'm a kindergarten teacher or a hostage negotiator or any of the thousands of other things people do when I'm not\nA so no I don't think that's a real concern at all I think [noise]\nThe ... or any of the thousands of other things people do when and and that are so no I don't think that's a real concern at all I think we build these tools to increase our own productivity and we we're all kind of better off because of them\nLet's talk a little bit by run about artificial intelligence or ... what is it and how are they able to make these things so smart\n[noise] well that's a great question what is it is is more complex than you would think because nobody agrees on what intelligence means but what what they what people mean by the term are two very different things that may have nothing in common so they either me\nOr what you see in the movies so commander data upstart trucker see three arena or\nA that would be an a machine that can do everything a person could do it's creative they can teach itself new things and we don't we don't know how to build that nobody knows how to build that\nThat's called a general intelligence or it is a computer program that can do one thing very well they can identify spam and your email it can route you through traffic\nAnd that we know how to do pretty well and the way we do it is really quite simple you take a bunch of data about the past\nYou get the computer to study it and make projections about the future\nAnd that doesn't sound all that interesting but that's in essence of what we do we're just a lot better at it than we used to be because computers are faster we can collect data much easier and the rest so we're now able to just do a lot of things that really looked\nSmart um by just using the simple simple techniques which are called machine learning\nOur our government's so far advanced with artificial intelligence that they're doing things that would just curl us if we found out what they were\nWell there's certainly that potential you see we we used to all have some amount of privacy or just based on the fact that there are so many others can't follow every person you can't listen to every phone conversation unfortunately with artificial intelligence\nThe kinds of tools were developing to do very good things like a dinner by cancer or something like that\nCan be used to to to to follow people voice to the to text so now a every phone conversation can be recorded\nAnd it can be turned into text uh computers are as good as humans that reading list so every camera even if it doesn't have audio can read lips as well as a human um\nYour you know you have a a device that tracks where you are and again all of these things ended up themselves aren't bad technologies but they certainly can be used in aggregate to profile everyone and you even have places in the world um\nYou know China has implemented a kind of a social score yeah that's right who\nRun run a red light you lose the ... if you go to an anti government rally you lose four points if you write a pro government blog you get two points and if you if you go lower now if you don't fly on airplanes anymore and you do um and and you do your kids don't get into good schools and you don't\nGet any may not even exist who knows right\nI Hope it doesn't come to that but but it just shows that these technologies really are\nUh have that capability of of of being misused of course hopefully in in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have governments that\nOf being misused of course hopefully it in a country where you have a lot of transparency and you have\nA government that you know you have a Republican but this governed by laws the price of liberty is a turtle vigilant so that so the price of privacy is the same that we just have to make sure that the laws are in place and enforced\nThat don't allow that to happen because it's certainly something that is technically quite possible\nByron is every tell them telephone conversation smart phone conversation being recorded or listen to or even though Ninety nine percent of them were probably mundane and don't mean anything but what are they being listened to\nI don't know I don't know but I I just said the technology is it a point where they could decipher you know what what what that many people are saying and then it can\nUh it doesn't have to understand it in the way that human understand something that decides to look for patterns in combinations of words along with um\n... and and and just kind of build up built obstruct profiles on people I mean all I'm saying is is it is it is a potential way to use this technology which can be\nTo do so many good things\nAnd you know I've got mixed feelings about this too because on one hand\nOr let's say that there are a group of terrorists talking about bombing or something and the computer you know is\nIs set up to pick up code words like ... or whatever and so it finds this uh on one hand it's an invasion of privacy everybody's privacy\nOn the other hand they may have been able to stop something from happening if they follow through with it and they go in you know catch the perpetrators I'm wrestling with myself Brian ... by run in terms of if it's OK or not\n[noise] well it is it and it is a new enough problem that we kind of don't have a societal consensus on how to deal with it we don't we don't have kind of norms you can find you know\nThe federalist papers that addressed that topic uh another that's going to have to be a conversation that we have over the course of the next several years about about what what we want\nAll right well stay with us we're going to take a quick break we'll come right back by Reverend Reese with us his book is called the fourth age we're talking a lot of high technology folks and what it does his website is his name linked up for you at coast to coast am dot com we'll be back in the moment don't\nTouch you dial never missed a detail of the show or a guest sign up for the ... ... email newsletter available for free at ... dot com [noise]\nA well I I Would say that I don't think so but I Will say this what what they're worried about a was look we mentioned earlier which is kind of artificial intelligence we don't know how to build a general intelligence and that's\nWe don't know how to build it but the idea that we could build it is based on the simple\nA supposition and that is that people are machines\nIf if you are a machine and your brain is ... machine in your mind as a machine and it stands to reason at some point in the future we can build a mechanical you and then over time that will become better and better and better it'll have an eye you have a hundred and two hundred and two thousand\nAnd two million and then it won't even know what you are um\nI find that idea that people are machines to be very pervasive in Silicon valley um my probably cost about it I I I find that the one person in twenty that doesn't believe that and yet when we take surveys\nOn my website asking essentially the same question about eighty five percent of the rest of the country doesn't believe that machine so you you should be worried if you believe you're a machine because eventually we'll probably build a mechanical birds you if you don't think human beings are\nJust machines then no than a machine could never do what a person can do\nTechnologically how did they make artificial intelligence work the way it does just with chips and the little things that they do I mean to me it's amazing that they can put this kind of ... brain power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering who really is\nUm ...\nIn power on a little computer chip\nYeah it it's staggering\nDo really is um\n... the thing is is that when a computer can play chess and when the computer can play go and when the computer can play poker and\nAnd do all of these things the way human does it ... you tend to think that it's thinking like a human is but but there really isn't quote anybody home there's nothing there that\nDoes any thinking at all it's it's one lives in zeroes manipulated and memory turned on and off\nAt the speed of light um it's done with which relative it it's interesting the techniques we use for it official intelligence we'd been writing about for forty years since just we've never had the machines to do it but it isn't some thing\nThere is a thought experiment called the Chinese room problem and it's about ... it goes like this series is\nThere's this rumor or that's full of these books and there was a person in this person is called the library and then it's important to note the librarian doesn't speak any Chinese people outside the route slide questions written in Chinese under the door\nTo this trying to the library in the library and picks\nThem up looks at the first character on the question goes and finds a book with out on the spine looks up the second character that sentence him to another book to another book to another book to another book\nUntil it gets to the end of the message the last book says write this down any copies these\nSymbols he doesn't even understand and besides the back under the door and the person who submitted the question looks at it and it's brilliant it's perfect Chinese since perfect and so the question is does\nDoes the librarian understand Chinese those are those the library and understand Chinese did turn to a lot of people in Silicon valley the idea that it can converse in Chinese but doesn't understand it doesn't make any sense but to a lot of people\nKnow they'll librarian doesn't know if they're talking about Colorado or coffee beans and the analogy is an apt one because that's all the computer does it runs\nA set of determining ... processes in memory it spits out an answer and it doesn't know which playing chess it doesn't know any what is talking about it doesn't know anything and\nSo you kinda have to ask is the computer thinking or not there's a computer understand anything or not a by my way of looking it doesn't it doesn't understand anything but other people other people say if it can do everything that is that something that does understand can do then you just have to say it does\nIt is just mind boggling and its guinea and even then or is it not the technology every year\nAbsolutely computers do this thing where it in a very simple short and they double in power every couple of years but on top of that we're collecting data faster than ever before right now there's\nFifteen billion devices connected to the Internet many of which can I collect data there'll be eighty billion by twenty twenty five and all of those you know you have all this data coming in and these faster computers and so it's it will only get faster and then if you think about it\nIf you think about it the Internet the mosaic browser cannot twenty five years ago\nA literal you in in Ninety three and\nAll that did was like computers talk to each other and that was hit and that somehow changed our world and that created twenty five trillion dollars in well a million new businesses it up in ... I mean it did everything that that imagine\nA technology that effectively makes everybody's smarter than they were before you go to bed\nImagine a technology that effectively makes everybody smarter than they were before you go to bed tonight everybody on the planet wakes up with ten more IQ points that is going to be more transformative then\nThe mere Internet which just connected a bunch of machines together this this is machines think\nReason will they show emotion Byron\nThat is an open question a it is even an open question whether you want them to\nI don't I'm not sure I Want them to\nSo the first question is do you want them to simulate emotion\nA there is there's a couple of different sides to that you know\nI have a desktop device that I talked to and I interrupt it and I tell it to stop in a way I wouldn't do a person um you had you had students had kids in Japan there was a a robot they let loose in the mall and these little kids would bother would beat it and\nThe robot learned benefits solved bunch of short people kids without a tall person around an adult it needed a run off to a tall person because the kids would abuse it now when I asked later the kids said\nThey thought it was feeling distress so they even felt like it was internalizing it you wonder about\nAbout a kindergarten teacher you know that the robotic that are raising children on fake empathy and you you you just start with that do you even want them to have human voices is that the noble the machine somehow or does\nYou know we've had the car away to these things called human rights a ... to a point where we say there are certain things you cannot do to any human being and because there's something special about a human being\nAnd and do we kind of want to make things look like humans that we do abuse and throw into a scrap heap and and and destroy without a second thought was that it suddenly having nothing effect on people now the question can they\nFeel emotion a that is an open question we\nWe have we have something called consciousness which is that we experience the world we feel warmth a computer measures temperature that difference whatever that is that you feel the warmth of something\nA computer right now we don't think or can we can measure temperature and even if you make a program that plays a person screaming at the temperature gets over five hundred degrees nobody believes that computer\nFeels that pain nobody believes that ... shaping up or sentient now the interesting thing is we wouldn't know it if I'm\nIf they did really well you wouldn't know if a treat the pain and you share half your DNA with the with the tree you should know DNA with a computer and so we wouldn't really even know if they ever if they ever developed a emotions\nAnd even if they claim they did that could just be in a way a program running that you know the the the\nProgram reasons that it can can achieve whatever objective it launched by making this claim I'm so\nIt's it's an open question it it all boils down to do you think of motions in the end are mechanical I mean our our ... again it's a punch you back to the original question are we machines and therefore our experience of emotion is just something mechanical\nWhat happens in these machines Myron go rogue and they start doing things to us to screw up our lives on purpose\nWell I'm a little like ... from two thousand one\nOn purpose well\nI'm\nA little like Hal from two thousand one space on\nRight I mean look if it ever happened uh we're completely vulnerable of course you know if there were eighty billion devices attached to the Internet\nYou know smart other news just turtle on and override their safety protocols I mean there are so many ways\nA malevolent machine would want to um would be able\nTo inflict harm the interesting and and so you kind of have to say what would that happen and it can happen in one or two scenarios either through Curtis programming the machine just does it doesn't have any intent at all um\nOr getting the machine somehow develop goals or the tone that are different than ours and purr perhaps in conflict with ours and and pursue those goals against those they're um they're open questions I mean right right now though\nBlink motion activated indoor and outdoor cameras are wire free set up and minutes and run on to double aid batteries that last up to two years\nAnd the live feed option let you check in from anywhere using blink smartphone app so you know when your kids get home from school they'll contracts go subscriptions totally affordable and blink works with Alexa\nBlink cameras systems are back in stock and right now they're Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent off all security cameras\nVisit blink protected dot com slash radio for offer details that's blink protected dot com slash radio is an Amazon company limited time offered terms and conditions applied from the\nJustice of heart ... studios K intend ti am north Las Vegas ...

to what's that's going to do but it's going to be a big one\nWell we know for example that machines called 'em robots or revolutionize the automobile industry with mass production I mean they they did things faster than humans can I'm coming from St Louis\nI've been in in in ... Bush factory and I see how they bond will be er a by the thousands in the bottles humans can't do with access ah\nYou're ... you're right that's the only official intelligent you it is to be frightening\nIf if you saw if you were a skilled crafts person and you saw unskilled people making more stuff better and cheaper than you like how terrifying watch that and yet we don't look back and say that was a bad thing did we\nNo not at all not at all and has displaced workers probably you can't have a million workers are filling up bottles by hand\n[noise] right and yet we never had unemployment and ah you know we never had unemployment along that time you also had an interesting phenomenon that from Nineteen forty call it the Nineteen eighty colored maybe forty in Nineteen Seventy you had a million women entered the workforce every year\nOr so you every year you you put a million more workers and and yet that didn't make unemployment go up either it was just new technologies more people are more jobs more well more prosperity so I think these ... I think anything that multiplies human ability is\nYou know what's up with a few exceptions the idea if you can make people more productive that's always good if you don't think it is\nThen you should support a law that makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create tons of new jobs it'll just take it\nThink it is then you should support a law that makes everybody work with one arm tied behind their back because instantly you create tons of new jobs it'll just take a lot more people to do anything uh but our productivity will plummet\nAnd so that's what technology is just like a third arm it means you will do even more\nLet's take some calls here for us by Ron let's picking up by going to Jeff in Tennessee welcome to the program beginning started hey Jeffrey go ahead\nOf time in the fall I Love your show George thank you John ... not ... wants to fly that that's something that could fit in fire [laughter] and I and I tell you what they don't have an impact on his show\nWow no saying that don't say that but what what's wrong told me that\nI Am disabled adults always that had to have faith that jobs are maintained the technology that taking out the white\nWell Byron you're saying that it creates more jobs\nRight I mean look at\nYou you can look at the un unemployment numbers in this country are you know good I mean they're they're down a there are some people who say the workforce participation rate is lower which are the number of people who actually are looking for work or almost all of that can be accounted for by a baby boomers retiring\nI'm ... you know technology always\nEmpowers people to be able to do more there's this kind of like an infinite number of jobs you\nYou can make a job instantly the minute you take something a lump of clay and you apply labor and technology to it you make something work more days and whatever value you were able to add that to wage\nAnd because technology lets you do more technology increases wages it it's really rough when it when it happens in a localized area and ah so you you get pockets of places where it takes a long time for it to kind of\nShake out and and that's rough and I think we should do a much better job kind of facilitating that up because you know if you can say well it's all going to work out in the long run but people live in the short run\nAnd and that's that's hard and and so we we got to be very mindful of that how we train people the kinds of safety nets we we provide but to turned against technology to say\nSomehow knowing how to be more productive as bad for for people or I think it's a hard case to make\nNow I'm opposed to and I've said this before driverless trucks I don't want to displace truck drivers or they're hardworking dedicated people and I don't trust the driverless truck I just know what do you think of that\nUm I think that's one of the biggest kind of miss that a\nIs there is going to be a huge a shortage of truck drivers I think that that goes you know\nWithout kind of without saying first of all they're kind of facing a demographic disaster that every year the average age of all the truck drivers is going up because everybody's like you know young people don't go into it because everybody's like there's no future in that because of self driving trucks so\nMost knowledgeable people in the industry are predicting we're going to have this this great shortage of them and even when we get over the technological hurdles and then when we get over the legislative hurdles they they still are only going to be able to do part\nOf of the hall I still don't want to see a driverless truck jeeze put it in Los Angeles traffic\nGo crazy [laughter]\n[laughter] well I agree there's a long way for the technology to go it's interesting that thousands of people die in car accidents\nI agree there's a long way for the technology to do it it's interesting that thousands of people die in car accidents and a president but if there's one accident with a driverless car makes\nAnd it's a huge ... in in in ... Arizona driverless car till the woman\n... yeah\nCouple of months that makes the news which you know thousands of other people that die in car accidents don't seem to look at them to be\nAt least ten times better maybe a hundred times better than humans before people would accept it it's got to be so overwhelming that you say uh you know we've got to outlaw people driving because people are just unreliable awful\nIs there anything about AI that you don't like\nNo I mean certainly put simply put if they are effectively makes people smarter\nThan to say that's bad is to argue for ignorance to say while it would be better if if we all woke up within fewer IQ points tomorrow\nHey I says look study data about the past and use it to project into the future that's the collective memory for the planet for ten thousand years on this planet people learn something a ... a big deal it all out and then they die and its forgotten or maybe they caught somebody and they messed it up now all of a sudden your life experience of my life experience become the data\nTo make somebody else's life better in the future and some no no the technology to say artificial intelligence is that it would be to

GM and Eastman Kodak really doesn't exist and they were you know that height maybe twelve years ago and uh you know that a lot of good research and uh\nThey didn't hold on\nA so sore the corporate level I think they they had to have made some missteps\nAnd then uh if you look at drawing safe I think uh there's\nAn obvious potential for chaos with them drones flying around and you're trying to walk down the block and as a drone flying at you or are they can be weaponized and and flowing into a a a ballpark law game as on\nSo that's another thing that finally just walking remotely I was

to all three of those things I'm to the first one you know you mentioned corporations and he's been ... it's very interesting to me that large companies don't usually make these leaps and the of the

sometimes a new technology comes along and they just don't adopt at blockbuster you know a streaming video came along and they were like yeah we'll we'll just wait and see and you mentioned them and I'm\nA Polaroid the same story which was digital photography\nAnd they didn't they didn't tell the story right block buster was another one\nWith regard to drones I agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out and\nBlock buster was another one exactly with regard to drugs I agree with you we're we're going to have to work that out\nAnd you know where where in such early days but uh but yeah there's going to obviously have to be some kind of like customs there's going to have to be laws it's going to have to be all kinds of stuff we don't have because that's a very real working

final segment Byron Reese with us author of the fourth age Byron Isaac Asimov three laws robotics let me quickly go through them and tell me how they would\nReally transform into artificial intelligence\nOne robot may not enjoy a human being or through inaction allow a human being to come to harm to a robot must obey orders given to us by human beings except we're such orders would conflict with the first law\nThree a robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection\nNot conflict with the first or second law so what are you saying is is robots can't injured human beings at any cost that is kind of like in conflict with they all of you know soldiers that are robotic\n[noise] yeah yeah that's true that's true you know the the the laws are are\nAre literary device so he can tell a story they don't actually get us very far um you know if I'm going to do something dangerous\nPotentially aren't myself does the robot according to those laws intervene and stop me ... ... if I if I order a second dessert uh and I got a few extra pounds on me that the robot say no you cannot the desert because that's going to hurt you I've got to save you got to protect\nExactly I'm monitoring your blood glucose levels are too high or whatever it\nExactly exactly so like from a practical standpoint the real challenge with robots is no two people\nKind of agree on what moral behavior isn't isn't and even if you just said well we're just going to pick\nYou know Joe and make use Joe's moral code for all the robots even Joe's moral code is like full of provide those and well you don't do that unless it's this but\nIf they're all they're all of these if it's in in that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots behave that way and like you said there's a lot of it's\nThis is and and that so we don't really have a way to make sure robots have ethically and like you said there's a lot of incentives for them not to\nThis is a robot out

thing that you might ask or any other person you meet like um\nGive it the simplest problem you can the these systems there there's something called the Turing test which basically says if you can't

are trying to pass that you would know with one question so they had to put all these rules like you can't ask about current events and you can't ask about and you can ask if there's any kind of get

particular morning nobody picked up the phone I called five people and no one picked up so I get on to the four or five and I'm Around at Sunset Boulevard\nAnd um my radio is everything is off I have my left hand on the steering wheel and I hear a voice as clear as you can hear mine right now that says put your other hand on the wheel\nIf your phone rings don't look at it in fact don't answer it

I I was ready so I was prepared to knowing that I needed to do that\nSituation is coming so um I you know I fortunately didn't hit me one no one hit me and I check to make sure everybody's okay get

willing to be open unless and they're there to help us and I was a really good thing because I\nOf hurt that woman in the car in front of me and she has no\nBaby it wasn't a woman in front of you their life that your guide with saving it was yours that's right I went oh okay [noise] does that change you well it it in a second it did so I got to work\nHave a weird day [laughter] because I'm thinking you know what a crazy morning that that night I get my car and I call my friend Pam who lives in Cincinnati and Pam is known as sister who was killed cameras in the car when it happened so is pants husband this\nSustains permanent brand brain damage at as of today from that accident [noise]\nSo called Pam tells the story and she says huh she just want to hear the other half of your story and I said sure she said you know and get depressed and stay in bed I said yes and she goes I was in bed when you called this one I had found in the bed with me I saw you calling I went to reach for the phone\nBut I was paralyzed couldn't move she said\nImagine what would have happened if I Would have picked up the phone and I said I'd be dead today she's like yeah you would\nAnd so yes it completely changed me because I firmly and fully believe that I'm going to but I Am on a bonus round\nSure and the big lesson\nIs about paying attention people say what's your book about and I said I can tell you a lot of things but the number one thing I'm going to tell you to pay attention and trust yourself\nWhen you take your picture ... mhm are you aiming at something or does it just how\nIt's both I learned early when I started staging everything one day I set the stage pot down and I started taking pictures of the smoke because it wasn't hadn't all burned out yet [noise] and um what I learned was\nThat smoke as like a canvas for goes\nI was able to see them so clearly in the smoke and they would like kind of pull the smoke around them I could see\nTheir shapes either form it without the smoke they were not there you could not see them\nAnd without the smoke I could still see ghosts but not as clearly and easily and as reliable as with the smoke was\nAmazing gift you have ... with us Julie we're going to take a quick break we'll come back and talk more about your work is the ghost photographer in our second hour we will open up the phone lines has\nDoes your dog age

photographer I\nLoved the subtitle of course is interesting ... were you talking about a Hollywood executives true story of discovering the real world of make believe it's coming true isn't it\n[noise] it it it it definitely is coming true it it it was funny I um when I'm sitting at my publisher she was asking me about one of my photographs and I said you know some of the creatures and then that I that I get and these photographs looked like they ... out of movies that are marketed\nAnd she goes\nOh my gosh you're living like the real world and make it isn't that crazy during the day and make believe and then at night\nComes true it kind of [laughter]\nReal world of may leave I sit isn't that crazy during the day I'm and make believe and then at night\nYou comes true it comes [laughter]\nHave you ever gone to the point where you were scared or you felt threatened\nYes I did one out of all times\nYeah you know when we can start going weird hair in a minute if you want to because\nSome of the things I encountered um are are strange in the summer scary and you know I found at times um and and this is where the Claire ... really that that gift comes in to comes in\nVery handy um where I can feel um if there is a ... a bad entity\nAn evil entity that is around and I learned something really important for folks to understand um and that is if you if you will find themselves\nWhere they have a ghost in their house they feel like they've encountered something and they they feel that fear in their body all they have to do is be in charge because they are in charge\nBecause it's the fear that they're looking for and so if you stand there and go get out of my house you are not allowed in here believe you can you say you can use any of the tools that you want but to exert your human dominant is like dominance like you\nYou can get rid of a seven like that and that's what I found because I started clearing people's homes\nAnd I started weirdly because I get my Oklahoma upgrade upbringing I was raised Episcopalian and so I knew the Lord's Prayer\nHadn't used it for really long time I'm\nDoing work for you\n... what's really interesting is that's another way that I could find if there were on you know dark spirits around is it I Would start saying though I like I started seeing the Lord's for over and over and if any point in time I forget or I ... there's something there\nYou're like a magnet it's kind of well maybe [laughter] ...\nI mean we all are telling the truth while I was gonna say do you think everybody has the capability that you know we're ... we're argue unusual\nYou know I think that we are all born with different gift that we're able to happen to\nUs I have a friend\nThat is the most incredible medium you will ever meet in your life and the specificity of the messages that she gets from the other side are detailed as addresses that you've lived in in your life\nWhen from the number of into the street name so I think everybody has something different you know it perhaps I have you know\nSo few weird capabilities and and the and in the world so yeah I think probably I Do\nYou actually because you're into course media a big way ... you Google ... when you were experiencing this how come\n\nYou know I think any time you encounter something new in your world right and your kind of yeah becomes your reality you want to see you want to know you're not the only one and I think I was looking to see how common are uncommon\nSpecifically the photograph did you get answers um\nI started to I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about it that really kind of ease my nerves\nOr did too I started to understand and that's when I started to actually talk about it after that and it was the talking about if that really kind of ease my nerves and then and then of course I turned to the movies and there are some really fabulous movies that are based on true towns and one of them is that movie the witch\nAnd did you do you ever see the which\nHave not seen you haven't\nSeen that there's a scene in which it it was based on the Salem witch trials like before the film which [noise]\nAnd I'm\nJay van ... who is the kind of friend advise the producer and and he did a lot of work at the New York public library pulling you know an original pamphlets from back in the day\nAnd there's a scene where the father or the and families circled around I'm the son who is um a possess\nAnd he says everybody must say the Lord's Prayer so they'll start saying the Lord's Prayer than the two twins are saying it and then they fall on the floor in concert shaking um because there was a there was a\nA like a\nEvil entity that was around and I later talk today about he was like oh yeah that's the Lord's Prayer is how it was like a\nDefining rod\nTo find them to know\nAnd and I'm like oh my gosh that's been happening to me the [laughter]\nSo it's weird how things happen without instructions I think that's a really interesting part about all of this\nIs that all this to sort of happened to me and there was no instruction book you know I was able to identify were goes to war I was able to figure out how to get them out of a space I'm I was able to figure out how to you know help other humans\nUm protect themselves and you know big thing I learned a lot about sleep paralysis\nYou you know the ... with your mom mapped\nMm ... [noise]\nWell\nIt was just like the ... syndrome\nI did for a little bit on this when we when we could be medical I mean it could be I mean could be\nPeople who have woken up here relies basically because they can't move ... syndrome then you realize you know you you you are where you can get out of it but I've also heard of the old ... ... basically ...\nYeah what I've heard what I read about in well actually what I I experience I I didn't personally experienced it um but I have a very close friend and this is how it all started that he was telling me histories of sleep paralysis and um and there's a an entity\nCalled the ... man yes you don't mind the whole ... I I I'm a friend and her and Facebook and I read her book ... girl I think Rudy is tremendous and expert on the house\nShe absolutely is and she is where one of the places I went to very quickly when my friend Alex started telling me about what he was experiencing\nUm and what's interesting also is that I'm a nightmare on elm street you know created by Wes Craven\nUm a friday right um he had Wes Craven um had sleep paralysis and he modeled Freddie Krueger based on the ... man because it\nCame to him that's right and nightmares right that's what was interesting with Alex\nIs um I I did a lot of research I I read ...\nBecause it came to him that's right and nightmares right do it was interesting with Alex\nIs um I I did a lot of research I I read Heidi's books I talked to friends um and one thing that I've also gotten into is I'm a crystals and stones and rocks and I I've taken classes and I'm even now a certified transmissible therapist so I've\nBeen a big when I started\nTo yes I Am I mean I mean if you're going to go go big George don't just take a few pictures that go send me go all the way\n[laughter] no longer\nRight and and also to serve others because that's really where the turn happened [noise]\nAnd I learned about the stone called black terminally and black term lane is a really powerful lock it is not the prettiest rock and the crystal kingdom but it's really a powerful and it and it actually holds a charge an electric charge just sitting on the counter [noise] um it's been studied by the juries\nAnd also by Benjamin Franklin so the stone has been\nA lot of curiosity surrounding it and it's also been used you know by magicians and those just like you know clear their space back in the day so on and so forth Sean and use it [noise] and um and I know what to protect us down so I said to my friend Alex is it how it's supposed to send your night stand\nSee you and your baby can get healthy now\nIf you are so many levels pregnant or thinking about getting pregnant and using alcohol drugs or tobacco Mrs Silverman\nHealthy babies that are called to unwind to find out today silver moms healthy babies that or is also has resources for health care providers friends and family if you wanted to help someone who's pregnant using\nVisit sober mom healthy babies that or a ... to one line today on the by the Nevada division of public and behavioral health and in collaboration with into\nThat a broadcasters association in this nation\nFrom the justice of heart ... studios in the Arab north Las Vegas game X.

man you\nKnow we know about the slender man but not the burning man who tell me about this one\nYeah so uh there was a story a back I think it was in the seventies\nOr an Italian security guards ... peers them Freda\nAh and he was called upon a house that looked like the word burglar hours to get you gone on to the scene\nWas full of alien creatures but a claim that he was abducted\nAnd several years later after his abduction a man outside of a gas station with a silvery shielding strange metallic dude on a it was described to be the greening man came and told him that the\nYou know everything's going to be All right and they keep coming in seeing him apparently this man it's been seen throughout your age and kids in a New Jersey's law and and um [noise] the the blackout man\nKind of seems like it might be on the same wavelength the then president said that the greening man's name was through the whole\nUh and that he was an alien um or maybe it's time travel or he doesn't really know what he was but he wasn't restroom\nAnd ah if you if you get a chance you know check out the reading man and a very strange uh currents that happens and no one really knows how to

and you know it's a really interesting concept 'cause it's the one that gets people really uncomfortable because so many people actually believing aliens who just don't believe they're here and I was asked the other day it's like well do you actually believe I said how can how can I not how can I not believe you know it it was in my backyard\nI Wonder if these movie church ... of these movies you dealt with or coming alive\nWell he does have a different philosophy what if it's possible that those that are actually making the movies are seen them themselves what of Walt Disney song all of those creatures that he put in his movies when\nI called them fantastical that's what I use the word\nIn Korea you know then created them when he saw them these\nThat he created money some I mean what is

I've heard it\nPronounced two different ways you may be able to correct me on what is the authority or wage pronounce that word I'm I first became aware of the ... watching one of my favorite shows supernatural I've been watching it on Netflix and um they introduced in ... I'm\nProbably nine or ten seasons into the show\nOr the way to be portrayed though I have no idea if it's done accurately I Know there's a source of debate over exactly what the ... are so let's begin there how exactly do you define ... what what is the ... what is the reality\n[laughter] sure I'm first act to say about the show supernatural um I started watching that at a couple of years ago and then binge watched it and caught all up to the current season\nAnd I have to say that the ... that while that show can be a little happy\nCan habits moments of uh of just pure entertainment rather than anything else um the writers\nHave their fingers on the pulse of Christian mythology and I only say mythology because uh uh lumping it into a world mythology other religions all their mythology put together\nA Christian mythology has its own its own versions of things and uh I think somebody's got a handle on that on the the whole war\nIs in the heaven issue the the ... the angels and devils or demons issue so I've enjoyed watching the show\nFrom that aspect knowing that again while it's got its moments of camp and pure entertainment there's something underneath that these writers no or have studied or research they wouldn't be surprised if some of these guys have been theologians at some point in their past\nOr who writes this show and put it together so\nI'm having said that I'm trying to remember the whole story arc with the nets lean\nA but I I think that uh they portray them more mythological you obviously than trying to portray them as factual or biblical historical beings\nAnd of course some people might say those two things are one in the same\nLima exist you can't prove that an angel exist you can't prove a demon or a devil exist the only way we prove those things is almost anecdotally personal experience\nOr the people who've had experience working with them people like you know John that fits in others who you can pull off the top of your head or these people that have had these experiences with them but still there is no way to prove any of their existence\nOutside of that if you will that that bubble that we have\nPeople who investigator research or deal with these things first hand it's like saying I saw a UFO and I know I'm not crazy but everybody else and I think you are but you have the personal experience so you know you saw what you saw\n'em it's the same thing with these things the ...\nAnd I've always pronounce it that way by the way the ...\nIt's actually a Hebrew word\nThat has that the team that suffix put on the end which denotes plurality are so ... is is actually didn't fall in the fall is singular which is to fall to come down\nTo leave one's first state um the word in the fall it's been used to fall in battle a to a a fall of in disgrace\nOr to fall or come down deliberately or knowingly and then you put that came on the and in the Hebrew energy notes plurality those who fell those who came down those who and so on\nAnd um so so that word has its source in the Hebrew language\nA and stands for those who came down fell down I'm deliberately or of their own accord came down it's not all and that's where people live ... I think you're Romney asleep linked left leaning with fallen angel\nLike do we know the stories from Sunday school leave enough how looser for I'm I'm a rebel against God and took all those with him or who also rebelled and they became the demons and things like this\nUh yet that is that is the Christian mythology um that\nAre ... nobody was there nobody actually recorded history we don't know that that actually ever happen but that is what the coming down the fall when the angels were then equated with those who fell those who came down\nYet never seem has nothing to do with the angels um it has to do with offspring or with beans that were created beings that existed um you have in the passage where their first mentioned in the book of genesis it talks about how and in those days\nAre the son of God it came down and intermingled with the daughters of men and had children by them and then it says and then the then the ... more on the earth in those days and also afterward when the sons of God came down and intermingled with the daughters of men\nAt ... I used to think that the ... the offspring of the this intermingling of the sons of God\nWith the daughters of men\nBut the passage doesn't actually say that\nUm it's as if they were on the earth in those days and also afterward um and by the way the systems of God as we read it in English and genesis sticks does the sons of God in in the hubris the Benet ... L. team and again you have that\nExcept the and the other team and the ... and the I Love you and police state of the ban a hot schemes simply means the sons of the God of many God\nAnd I love hearing was the name given for God almost two thousand I'm Sorry three thousand times in\nThe Old Testament passages and that's one of the names used for God and a fellow he literally means el is the word for God off and the team of a plurality\nSo it was the name for God is the God of many gods were among many God is the name used for God\nThree thousand times in the Old Testament and it says the sons of the other team\nOr the God of many gods the sons of the God of any gone are the ones who did send it to the earth and impregnated human women loved them it says took them as wives and so on and then you've got the ... these characters which are a it's a bit and ... and a medic because\nIt doesn't really said they were the queen of this intermingling but it says they were there and so there was always\nI Know in the book I wrote about it I had mentioned them as being the children are the offspring of the sons of God or the L O game or the watchers is some books called them\nAnd we have just a minute before before the break I rent somewhere about equating the with giant ... is is there any truth to that or is that completely false\nYou know that was that was one of the translations early on in the sixteen eleven King James version of the Bible they translated ... giant and it says in the giants and the earth in those days as a matter of fact you go to the way up to the story of David and Goliath\nUm and it talks about Goliath being a giant but it said he was a he was out the sons of the ... team he and his three brothers and a and they also call him a giant and they give us a measurement is\nSix Cuban tennis fan which is roughly nine and a half feet\nAnd so you've got this particular now I've heard some of the legend or the myth of the ... or the giants have them at thirty six feet tall and they would have to eat herds of thousands of votes every day to sustain themselves\nWell I think you're pretty much would have run out of sheep and goats\nBy that time uh if they live more than a few days so I think there's some there's some literary or mythological exaggeration going on when you're talking about them but they're definitely spelled out as being beings that are different\nWell God he you're making trouble we don't talk about that stuff so much\nWe just don't we don't believe in the weird mystical elements of all of this\nAnd I said well by choosing to believe that are we not then contradicting what we say our charter is\nWhich is we believe what the language says and that there's meaning to it in a means something and of course it was told that was a troublemaker into a better shut up about it it was kind of a wink wink nod nod nobody was really angry with me they just said did you get just just let it go let it go well that started really my quest\nMoving a bit away from the allergy in the church and a teachings of that sort to see how they mixed um comparatively with other religions\nHow long do you eat the battle has already before you decided to change course a little bit how how long are you in that program\nI I became a born again Christian when I was eleven years old\nAnd I attended the Baptist church going back to Sunday school and all the Baptist activities are all the way through high school and went to the Baptist college that was sanctioned by our church\nOr I went to the the seminary and it was even in ministry for a while I was a youth pastor and and worked on a ministerial level or for about ten years after that thereabouts\nAnd uh so I Would say well into my late twenties\nEarly thirties I was very much\nIn that religion I very much um you were in that religious dried drifted off as some would say in the Baptist church I back slid and I went to the ... free church for a while ago because it didn't feel like\nTo me and then I'm making a a a religious statement here I guess a bit but uh that really ultra conservative fundamentalism in the Baptist church\nSmacked of iron bars Christianity I called it was a lot of legal is um there was a lot of extra biblical things that were telling us how to live and uh I said no I don't like that's not what I Believe and I so I went to something it was a little\nBe a little more liberal in the theology and uh um\nAnd then eventually drifted very far away from it and uh you know which brings me to where I Am now Thirty years later and uh I just began having too many questions about things I found that the scripture itself while it contained\nA teaching about God\nI was starting to have a problem with\nAll the other things all the things that seem to contradict over textural criticisms that contradicted each other and uh um so I had a problem with a number one was this issue of the ... or the L O team\nWhich uh either did or did not between them but came first these low team\nI said if the name of God is God among many God or got up many God\nThen is he a singular God is the is there is mano theism really taught in the Bible\nI started looking into it some more [laughter] it skews me and um there's one passage if you go to the book of the some of the songs have dated and others who contributed 'em installed eighty two it talks about how\nElla came good in the midst of the uh low he him\nAnd he singular said to them plural you are all L O team the bright shining prince says eleven\nBut then he goes to cast judgments on them for something that's unnamed in the passage\nOr some sin of theirs that was that was committed many think that this is the judgment that was placed on them when they came down to the earth and intermingled with the daughters of men or you look at uh the book of Enoch which is not in canonize scripture you won't find it in your Bible\nUm but it's the earliest chronological book written in scripture next to Joe\nAnd some say well that only dates back to the fore hundreds that book will know the for hundreds that book was written it was a and updating or a copy of the original book of Enoch\nAnd uh which we don't have in our in our position but he not speak of the two hundred three sick who descended from heaven onto the slopes of mount Herman in northern is what is now northern Israel\nAnd they went in amongst the common women and they went in there great sin was that they'd disobeyed God and doing this and they went in among the women they married them and said they love them they had families with them\nUm it wasn't like this demonic takeover or something and they were called pretty sick\nIn the book of a of a of enough and what's very interesting is people want to say these were angels yet the Hebrew word for angel my luck or mother team in the plural is never used in any of these passages what's used it a little team\nWhich is a totally different kind of being A L o scheme is God among God\nAnd or not and jealousy\nAnd so you've got these characters in the book of Enoch came down caught forbidden knowledge to humans\nAre married the women taught them craft are the craft of life you know like agriculture and and uh uh uh metallurgy and and uh ... uh all these different kinds of things they supposedly\nWhich ties into some of the old ah Mesopotamia and legends of ...\nAnd these half God a Half Men are creatures a fish inform would rise up out of the Mediterranean or out of the Euphrates River and teach the people and they'd go back there it and buy nice and they'd come in and they teach the people all the forbidden knowledge of the God\nAnd so all of this stuff all kind of wrapped up together were the questions I had it started driving me away from\nThe the organized church I had been part of and had my training in and said wait a minute if there's more here than meets the eye\nAnd scripture is full of things that you know what I say that a reading the Bible when you really read between the lines of like reading the history of the lord of the rings and when you go to the book of Enoch it's like reading the history of the lord of the rings on crack and uh\nSo you've got all this stuff that's wildly different than what we were taught Sunday school\nSo you were branded as a little bit of a troublemaker but it really just sounds to me like you're just very naturally inquisitive you like to question things\nI Do and ... and it's not just for the sake of questioning although I question a lot of um it was because I wanted to know some things that I brought up in the first segment is that\nI don't want to be taught something and told this is so I Want to know why I Believe something I Want to know what's behind it\nUm I Want my face to have an object in other words I was told I needed to live my life by faith which is this very esoteric wonderful thing for people to live their lives I said I struggled with that I said I don't want to live by faith I wanted to live by knowing something\nUm it's like a Richard find them and I've I've brought him up many times and we mentioned me and my books are astrophysicist to his contemporary to Einstein and Oppenheimer\nAnd he did a lot of uh lecturing him very uh you can still listen to some of his stuff online that you can find it\n[laughter] excuse me I'm Still getting over a colder\nAnd up\nA uh I'm I'm Simon said I Would rather\nEat in fact it's natural for me to doubt and to question he says that's how I see things as being doubting them and questioning and and that's the scientific method in the scientific process he says but what I don't want to do is believe something my whole life\nAnd then die and find out I was leaving the wrong thing because only believed it by faith because it didn't question that I didn't doubt it I didn't seek other answers I'm I wanted to know things and that's really where I Am I'm a I I I Want to know\nI I Would rather die not knowing than to die knowing something that was wrong\nYou do what I mean by that and that's really what drove me really out of the church and out of ministry um ... was that the this deep desire to question not just lower my head and say\nOkay whatever the church teaches that must be right that must be word God is that must be where the soul is and and I struggled with that um and so\nThat brought me to you know really to where I Am today\nOur guest is got to you Robert ... is a writer researcher described as a rule historian and ...\nExpert buddy is many other things and we're
