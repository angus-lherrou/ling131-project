I met a lot of really beautiful people from Arkansas\nAnd it always strikes me as somebody who is a free wing neither blue or red in my in my tribal political identity that seems to be polarizing the country as your reports said\nWorse than ever before um but when I actually go out of my blue range into the red range of Americans I meet really decent beautiful people who and I listen to them and I can see\nSo much potential if people would just stop listening to this ratings the rating the horrors of of a mainstream news\nAnd just wouldn't talk to each other\nAnd they don't talk anymore John that's no problem nobody they scream they argue but I've\nActually found the people in the red states more willing to talk than I Do the people around me who call themselves progressive [noise] and I live in the deep blue western Washington part of what Washington\nAnd uh it's uh it's intriguing to me because of the thing that I did back in January of this year I I put together already\nA this forecast which is the main essay at the end of ten predictions twenty eight team that you just mentioned and uh I was just reading it again after many months\nAnd I can't really say that I Would change anything that I put it is a that was basically is happening is [noise] a\nAnd I put in it's a that was basically is happening is\nA a level of if you're gonna defined it in planets there's two major planets and astrology political strategy either play right now one is a is you're honest and just recently come into tours\nAnd then there's also newly into its home sign of Capricorn Saturn [laughter] long story short it's a struggle you're honest finds itself in the ... sign which means it's dealing more with focusing on personal needs and desires and expectations\nWhereas the the earth the sign of Capricorn Saturn is is the arbiter of the establishment of the bigger powers bigger than the individual and so you have a long story short it's it it favors\nThe establishment more than it favors those who are resisting the establishment\nUm because Iran has in horses in its fall and it's in layman's terms that means um this this ruler of Aquarius is in the least comfortable sign\nThat it's translating through now last time it did that was back in the early thirties and when it did that coming into tourists it did two major changes in political astrology it brought the German third rice into being under adult Hitler\nAnd it also uh aged Franklin Delano Roosevelt new deal to\nDestabilize established a banking ideas and things that were restructured that in in a positive sense created a this this longest a profitable wealth a period of the ... in history [noise]\nUh that happened because of the reforms of the banks those reforms have slowly been shipped part by Reagan and Clinton and his two terms than Bush and now we were almost back to where we were almost the same kind of demographics of the of the separation between the fuel all the and the\nMajority who have not so much wealth\nIs almost exactly where it was in uh Nineteen twenty eight just before the crash\nAnd so we are repeating a cycle and uh so the the issue is that Iran is if ever I saw something that expresses itself in in Iran is in the fall the revolutionary the innovators the person with the original thinking\nIt's affecting a what's called the resistance to the current situation in the White House and and it is a it is expressing itself with great passion and unpredictability button its negative it's\nAbout destroying from getting the house back\nGetting the Senate back but for what it's not really defined itself\nIs what we know what the resistance is against I hear it all every day here because I live in the very heart of it here but but we I always keep asking them I understand your problem there but what are you for\nAnd if and if you followed this pattern\nWith much more energy to it than it happened before because I remember this happened in Nineteen Ninety six when I was telling people who couldn't believe me after Nineteen Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said no ah Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six\nIn Ninety four and the Republicans won the house and sent back I said no uh uh Clinton is going to be reelected in Ninety six I was on a show in Portland five hundred thousand Oregonians watched it and the man who had a meltdown said you're absolutely crazy that can happen and of course four years later\nI said well no it will happen because if you're ... anybody but Bill Clinton you're you're you're you're fundamentally a you don't have anything to replace him except your wife tearing down and then and it won't work um it didn't I see it ten times worse now than it was before\nAt least at least and and it's being I mean it's being\nThe people of this country are being so terribly played by the corporate owned media news\nThat it it's really quite and this classic um you're on us confusion and its fall and tourists you know where you should be grounded you're just you're your emotions your attitudes are just a lot of mud earth science it's a muddy place a swamp the muddy place\nAnd unfortunately it plays similarly to the chaos that was happening in Germany it plays to some kind of savior that's going to come\nAnd save you from yourself\nAnd you know I've been on a long long time first with art and then with huge orange I've been talking for twenty five years now about how the danger of fascism rising again in the world and America being one of the leading places for it\nIs really a hand now it's um it's not going to be when I look at when I look at the situation on the sixth of November it's most interesting [noise]\nWe have a unique thing happening where Iran is going retrograde its back going backwards and in the sky which means that it's a time to recollect where you've been go in and kind of resolve what is the mechanics of what you're doing on the outside world\nEspecially if it isn't working and you're honest is leaving tourists around or just shy of eleven o'clock Pacific Standard time on election day and starts backtracking into aries now what that means is that if if red voters threat American voters go to the polls early\nEspecially in a lot of the areas which will be in the early times\nTV grown past us ... dot com and download the UFO Dee

we talk about prophecy predictions John we've got to get into your two thousand Eighteen productions how many have come true already\nWell uh there have been a number of the more little shocking than my my ate proxy what I did is basically short um chapters that takes a team and then look at it fully and\nWant to give us some headlines of of of the ten real quick\nYes they they were the the definition of the year being the year of acceleration definitely things have intensified that way second prophecy was or you're out of the last ... style but\nAt a play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together\nI'll bet looked at the play between Iran is in Jupiter that made it possible for actually the government to come together and have more common ground but\nThat petered out by may ... and that seemed to happen in a way where there was also the third\nProphecy will Trump be impeached or not in twenty Eighteen and it looks like that's definitely happening\nUh I've always said that both candidates and twenty sixteen were afflicted a astrological early both had the danger if not or if they did not survive their first two years in the first term they may not survive the term in office that means leave office\nNothing nothing of physical or violent nature I see in this\nBut that they could leave in scandal or something like that so you know we're we're entering a point now where the president will be two years in office at the end of January\nSo ah it will really be very interesting to see what happens in this mid term like I was saying before that the first half of the day goes to the red states and the red voters say get out early vote early\nIndeed is really going to probably be decided in a week or two while people are doing their absentee ballots\nBut there is a possibility for a surprise to happen in the west the delegates that the legislators that will be a battling for dominance in the house of representatives\nWill ah see a surge towards the blue in the afternoon so it'll be interesting to see those battles states in the west that uh might see an eleventh hour or\nClose to the polls a turnaround so with that um you know if before I go to the fourth prophecy I was simply say about President Trump that\nIf he survives this um these two years he will I still see has the potential to be a two term president oh what's what's so hard for the polarized people\nIn my family of readers it's like I have this family they're all arguing at the table with each other and I'm just quietly watching this and try and taking notes yeah taking off\nAnd it's like yeah I mean literally is a large family members and other things are are getting quite involved and passionate about it and I'm going well [noise] um every everybody who watches their own tribal news and this is classic Iran is in the fall and for us\nUh they're they're they're just watching the news and there's assuming that the other side is hearing all this and this is going to change their mind the truth is both sides of tuned out each other the red the red side watches Fox the little blue side watches MSNBC and CNN\nAnd the Twain shall never meet so this the other thing too that I look very carefully and it is that so many of the Democrats who once felt white working class Democrats that really went and voted for Trump because they've been neglected for few presidential cycles [noise]\nI Do not see a change in their opinion they're going to hold with Trump until six years he's a two term president\nAccording to my interpretation of the astrology they're going to give them a chance when I talk to them and the red states I see it's very clear that they're not going to budge also the other thing that once again Democrats are overlooking is the power of the evangelical vote I said\nA general minister\nAnd I said ten months before Trump was elected I said the the big ...\nI said ... minister\nI said ten months before Trump was a ...\nA elected I said the the big upset could happen through their\nUm and so it's it's my sense is that there will I don't really honestly see a lot of budging a lot of moving\nIt's almost like it's it's a musical chairs that we've had before where it's the same numbers even if the Senate goes to the Democrats at the same number of seats just switching back and forth\nAnd in that there's not enough to create any significant legislative advance\nSo it's it's just more and I my sense is the next two years are going to be even more\nThis functional than anything we've seen before\n... units almost unbearable now\nWell it's I I hate to say it to everybody across the United states coast to coast but we're entering a period we're not we're not at the end of this this this crisis it's going this evolutionary challenge that's happening to the United states and the world\nIs just going to get more intense and we're not at the point yet where people are ready to break out of their tribal identities and actually think of a way to get out of this merge and it's going to have to get much worse and frankly astrology is a saying that you're\nNot going to see it applied shift until the middle of the next decade we're we're we're just entering the worst part but we're not even to the other side of this\nVeil yet we're not even close it's going to get much worse than what's going to happen which kind of brings me to the issue of Kavanaugh and all the small fighting about that [noise]\nIs it I said very clearly in my back in August eleventh my articles than that Kavanaugh would be picked that um [noise]\nI I think people are stabbed rushed in that and I think the thing that most people on the left are afraid of is really not saying they should be looking at according to their needs [noise]\nIf you look at cabin on the stars and what he's done his record I don't think there'll be weighed it has any danger any of the social issues are going to be upset by this Supreme\nCourt no I don't think so a lot but I\nThese this time with the Iran us and Saturn the defining planet so next year and into twenty twenty\nThese these planets the way they're positioning the way they're going to move in and out of harmonious affects and that means harmonious two major corporate establishment will to power [noise]\nThat you're going to see with a man like Kavanaugh he will he will vote\nA hundred percent in favor of the corporations\nAnd you're going to see this creeping coup d'etat of corporate uh hedging money which started with Citizens United in January of twenty ten this will be resolved crystallized by some time in twenty twenty when Saturn is about to leave\nA Capricorn it's a sign and go into the sign that the last time it was in an Aquarius those were the great masses and sometimes violent citizen mass revolutions like the French Revolution that's the last time it happened\nAnd so it's possible that after twenty twenty the American people or or the working people people started really starting to get riled about situation or there will be basically in the ...\nOr or the working people people started really starting to get riled about situation a there will be basically in a completely corporate elite control the United states and so that's that's my call I Hope I'm wrong I Wish I was more

of Iran and it is always long story short the\nThe not Saddam's prophecies that are quite clear about this is a look to eagle kings of the north get pulled in this as a Russian double eagle and the American bald eagle ... countries get pulled in because of their allies there\nIs a look to eagle kings of the north get pulled in this Russian double eagle and the American bald eagle ... countries get pulled in because of their allies their vessels\nWhich are described in an anagram as Arab vessels by by a dye or OB in in French at that that kind of our ... rebel against their their their masters and drag Russia and America into a war\nAnd that can happen with the issue of Iran even last few twenty four hours of the weavers end of the peace treaty that we've had with Iran since Nineteen fifty five of course it was with their dictator the\nShock over through their government two years earlier that was democratically elected\nThat doesn't get told you in the u._s. press by most of the ... months to their yeah see I took him down to help the British Petroleum censoring retain a Iranian oil\nAnd then they helped train the survivor which was as worse as bad as the gift shop all in Germany and terrorize the people as one of the reasons why the Islamic that's why many through the shah ... yes and so so this bad karma here and we're basically blindsided to our side\nAh in this and we need to take a look at how we kind of gotten here comical early now so so\nWe have a situation with ... which really got me concerned in August where it's the last province where fifty thousand al ... affiliates who we've been supporting\nCity in Syria Syria yeah we're going to make their last stand against the Syrian Arab Army and the Russian air force and the Turks\nWere also involved what happened in eleventh hour just before it started\nIs um aired organ of ... or ... the president of turkey and water and food and\nGot together and made a pact to not do the offensive to create a buffer zone a demilitarized zone and take the time to do something to help the people the three million people half of which are are are\nAre refugees all crowd that area owns a horrible\nWhat what's good about that is it's it's an attempt not to have this thing happened I Know from my sources that there were a lot of uh the ... stage in film the White Helmets who are basically al ... is a\nA R [noise] uh had already taken\nChildren and use them and some gassing attack that's the story I'm trying to track down\nAnd we're going to be broadcast is still ... started as a once again another false flag the Syrian regime had chemical weapon eyes them and that would have caused a you know we have thirty Russian warships says this time around\nAnd the ah near equal number of American ships crowding the eastern Mediterranean long story short we have a lot of military potential in a tight area that if a miscalculation happen it could get serious and and so and\nThen one thing can lead to another into a nuclear confrontation I mean the missiles of the missiles of October in sixty two can become the missiles of October twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen\nI'm ... kind of points to and some of the deadlines Nostradamus gave to along in a short deadline if if we kind of move up what may be the official start of the Cold War when the Russians announce they had ...\nA long and short deadline if if we kind of move up what may be the official start of the Cold War when the Russians announce they achieved a parity in March first this year\nThey delayed they're putting the delayed his address to the nation Russia and then he so he could see what what the military changes the rules of engagement was going to happen with the Americans\nHe I I actually quoted a lot of this speech and it shows it's very interesting look at how we've been an arms race again with Russia because we pulled out of the ab a missile treaty\nAnd which was a seriously destabilizing move to unilaterally do it for a long story short they had to create a new system of of weapons that could be a deterrent to was surrounding Russia's steadily with a anti ballistic missile batteries\nTo basically be able to shoot down their missiles so they couldn't defend themselves\nA very very destabilizing move a hardly reported\nSo the Russians declared in March first is pretty much we're in this Cold War and they have now made a parity you know interestingly enough fruit and drops ten billion dollars off the eighty billion dollar budget of the Russian defense\nThe same time Trump adds another thirty seven billion to something that's past seven hundred billion if you add the other sides to it were really spending one point one trillion dollars [noise]\nUh on defense spending in our military ironically it's half of what the US people produce monetary lead GDP every year which is exactly what happened at\nThe same time when the Soviet Union collapsed it was paying half of its money into its big military ah and they collapsed were doing the same thing so\nUh it's it it reminds me of prophecies of ... through the spirit was channeled by ... and ... who was considered the Swedish Edgar Casey in the Nineteen eighties\nAnd um because he channeled similarly and trance and he ... he would say things like that you'll see the one side of the Cold War with China and Russia have become more free in America would become more like the Soviet Union and least in this economic sense\nThat's true ah with more censorship it's happening to alternative voices you know the that's also a ... I Would say for my own experience with journalism that we're definitely looking more and more like the Soviet Union I grew up with\nThe country I grew up with no that's true in in ... and the last one this week before the break them will take final calls next the half hour you're writing a book about celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain who committed suicide and then this this intrigues me why are you doing this\nWell I've been watching Antony ... since two thousand five I've learned so much about his unique rebellious but really an unorthodox way of\nKind of dragging me along to see the world many of the same places I ate in in my travels\nIt's kind of taking us through a journey through the stomach\nTo really meet with people and people break break bread they they they it it's a connection it's ... it's well I was saying earlier in the show how we can we need to talk to each other rather than polarized both\nHave a big bank would have all the red Republicans and the blue Democrats break bread together like Anthony would do so anyway\nWatched the show\nHave a big bank would have all the red Republicans with blue Democrats break bread together\nLike Anthony would do so anyway I watched the show I also saw this brilliant man his doing what a lot of potentially brilliant people and he's also seeker\nA spiritual speaker in a true sense because he wasn't buying into easy a rationales believe he was really questioning thing and of course seeing the world like he was he was seeing the darker sides of it as well and it wasn't a surprise to me that he committed suicide\nI feel as much as I Love him I also had a similar things issues in my own\nLine really let's talk about that John when we come back in the moment that will take your calls those have you on hold just hang right

one more area to talk with John about and he's writing a book about the late celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain and boy\nYou sparked my interest John because it sounds like you had a very a similar situation what happened\nI did it's really a a tale of two suicides a and both of us committed suicide the reason I Am speaking to you is because\nMy experience with suicide was a spiritual suicide rather than the usual what I call mundane suicide and most people encounter\nUm basically in the mundane suicide I contend that you end up with your pain destroying the body mind that you're that you're mystery of Seoul is living in\nBut in the suicide that happened to me rather than the one that I was indeed mundane league going to do [noise]\nI saw my misery and my pain commit suicide and remained\nAnd so this is one of my most intimate autobiographical tales of a whole other dimensions of my life from\nAll these years I've never known this\nWay I was I was I was walking through a golf course in San Pedro California I\nJust come back from India and I was still in the tender opening kind of broke out of my shell of\nMany lives being with my my teacher and India for the first time and when I came back in the world the world that was not a place that supported this kind of individual flowering and it was having a very bad day\nAnd so I was walking down this beautiful beautiful a golf course adjacent to the trailer park I Lived in\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliff and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me so I could just keep walking\nA overlooking Santa Catalina island in San Pedro cliffs and that's what I was walking it just dawned on me and says I could just keep walking\nOr beyond these cliffs and plummet down three hundred feet into the rocks and I was going to do it because suddenly\nIce had this amazing unexpected experience of life and death suddenly being very tangible and clear out to see how they're really one there really there are plenty of compliment trees or in our fear they're a play of terror and opposites\nBut what was happening to me the feeling was that try to describe it but it's beyond words really beyond belief\nIndeed it was like um it was descending on me faster than myself and I thought okay this is happening because I have made the decision to throw myself walk over this cliff\nIf I turn away from this I'm going to lose this amazing experiences over taking me this mystery of life meeting death\nSo I saw this little eucalyptus tree and I sat up against and I said okay for throwing myself over I just wanted to feel this and take this with me over the edge\nAnd so I sat there just going inside and feeling it at some point I felt this electrical energy just rise up all the ground through the roots of the tree and throw me forward face down into the crab grass or I just began sobbing sobbing and suddenly\nAll of that thank God all of that so that otherwise I wouldn't be telling you you know not at all and uh\nAnd and there was this moment after I cried it all out I turned and there was a little old eucalyptus trees and it was just shivering it sleeves and the Santa Ana wind and it was just this moment where ... sky the earth tree\nExistence love me existence sees everything that's created out of it as a phenomenal creation rising and falling as something absolutely integral significant\nAnd I had this feeling that so much of what society does to make us feel in significant when\nYou go in even at that moment of life meeting dad insignificant becomes in significant\nI it's so the story is really an a it's a it's a jump from what I usually right about but it's a whole other level of talking about these things that I haven't done since I did the ... is a book back in Nineteen Ninety nine\nSometimes my these books you see I I don't write these books they right they use me to write themselves and\nI had no idea until Anthony Bourdain died\nHow deeply he his his suicide how much he was loved and how many many people were shocked\nThe story I talk about the moment that inspired me to write this book I mean the cashiers line and\nThere's this old lady and she's doing something looks like she's never done before she's pulled actually a magazine out of Iraq and looks at it and it's a people magazine of an seaboard Dane and I watched how she touched his cheek on the picture the way she did it was so\nIntimate and beautiful and that's when I realized gee how I Love him just as much and I think I think I understand what he was going through he was not a man to believe or in fairy tales and imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his ...\nAbout it's really pretty practice and and and and people like that\nAnd imaginary stuff and that Santa Claus is going to save him from his ... and all about it's really pretty practice and and and and people like that when they die and I always feel there's a person that has the potential to become a an awakened one\nAnd I as I have been in my private life which I'm sharing more and more now in this period especially now when there's so much turmoil when there's so much\nUm Hanks and polarity\nMy inner life now as a meditate or is now coming more and more into my work because it is still ... point this center of silence and peace in the cycling of life that's becoming stronger and stronger that\nIs what I can share with all of you is meditation the science of self observation\nIs is what what more and more I always thought my my work with and evil more and more and it's still prophetic but it's going to have more of my own authority through my own experiences\nFuture let's take some calls here in the ten minutes we got left Thomas in Iran with John Hope Tom\nHi George thank you for taking my call and John while it's hard to follow your sharing of your experience on that but my question John yes\nFor our person to walk in the world to be a participant in the world\nHow can they develop their own centered mess so to speak such that they are not enough for dead on a fact dead on touch my personal and planetary astrology\nWell what I can only suggests and I think only anyone who's honest and heart to heart with anybody is all I can suggest as my own experiences the meditation techniques that I've been using since Nineteen eighty\nAnd ah so my answer to that is if any of you listening to this resonate with what I've been saying\nEspecially with the issue of suicide in life meeting to\nUm I Am on a path where I can say there is a way to look beyond and not be touched you can be passionate and deeply into life but you're not overwhelmed you're you can be a Buddha and the marketplace but not of the marketplace of the world\nAnd that was what my teacher taught oh show and that is what I've live since Nineteen eighty since I went to India to see him for the first time and so with that said if you go to hope prophecy dot com and if you

it kills everything from the inside\nThe building that left standing perfectly damage at all and I believe that's how these demons wanted destruction in any form to any human I mean I mean look at every single country hate each other out there they're ready to bomb each other for almost nothing but anyway real quick towards my dad moved to salt in New Jersey\nI think in my career as a special ed teacher\nOr I start working with kids who didn't have any qualities attributes of characteristic that normal people have this war began to feel like I was blessed George ... ah you have to work with these kids who appreciate that that's when I started trying to pay back\nFor just being normal so I started a prayer life I always had a prayer life but I saw it apparently this is a prerequisite for white had this ...\nI mean it is for kids that have nothing going from I even had some kids in my classes\nHad these terrible Kansas and I would draw for them and they always they want the joy so I Would give them like coloring books in crayon and they would try so hard to keep those those those are ... that the crayons in in the lines are with the numbers more but some of them has such terrible if your parents who say they would rule follow insurance\nOr a coloring they withdrew their mouth is rule of law was in school you were at\nWell I was just it was ... yeah I was a special ed teacher had different classes you know and just happened to be in these classes it was it shows in like that okay I but I Will be cleaned it up for them it was nothing to rule because they did that all day long so that they didn't mean anything to them\nEr and er so ... you know they were learning the skills that they were never going to use it you know there was no really cure for them back to and even today just really no cure\nSo as a special ed teacher had a lot of time in my hand and the kids needed two hours for lunch with the teacher said with health feed them or there's no papers to correct\nThe bigger kids have had in the ... in the room used to move boxes long I enrolled us you know when you see a tractor trailer pull up to a warehouse and they put out there was\nI enrolled in the boxes on him to shut them down and you know there's a lot of them don't you know\nYeah so this is the school supply\nI enrolled lives in my class sideline up the kids I take until it can get it box put it on the island world he was flight adapt to the next kid they ... they would open it up to fight it down to the next year they put something inside of down to the next ... tape it you know so that's what they did so I had plenty of time\nSo she was I knew how to watching so I said bought him to the nightclubs and I believe this is a real prerequisite of what why they steam and came to the south\nWe doing two jobs John\nI mean it is that thing is special ed teacher didn't take up much of my time at a two hour lines I didn't have papers to correct you know so I decided you know it gets going to do this too\nSo um yeah so uh uh ... you know people at night and look at all I Know a lot of ... and the people but there was a certain percent of people out in the dark side of things these people are like little wicked you don't have control of course\nThe alcohol or drugs or commit adultery looking for anything they can get their hands on and a good portion of these people were atheists or they went to the coast a little bit\nMake George I can get along with anybody I can relate to anybody and this type of behavior didn't even bothering factor but she was over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from accidents like ...\nUh relate to anybody and this type of behaviors enemy ... over the years I noticed that a lot of these people die from accidents like car accidents overdoses suicide Kansas and ... and I bought it with these people and and I knew them you know\nBut I felt that these people like ships in the night without a rider\nAnyway then I take 'em to go with a ... or the wind was blowing that was fine with them and they died the state that I thought nobody should die\nThen we're the last rings unusually high\nYeah unbelievable and so um you know I just didn't think they knew how to live I mean that's another thing this\nBook is going to teach you how it teaches you the nose I self you know knows I mean it's I'm not trying to be somebody else knowing their self means knowing the truth about you you are what they do look at what you'd do analyze what you do then analyze what you believe about yourself you might find it completely different person here\nI mean I had one friend I tried to get through this quick because I Know we want to get into his name is Chris he was a button that he worked right alongside and he was an atheist and the used to make fun of God used to make fun as you just used to make fun of the Virgin Mary and he smoked and drank every night seven nights a week\nHe didn't feel well they went to visit a doctor and he found the early had four states can't oh so\nHe couldn't work anymore so I tried to visit in between my you know going from school my school jobs and my nights off\n[noise] ah we work together I mean it was like a friend you know I Know you had all these problems but\nYou didn't know what\nI Know he had this for about forty years in a in a few months and he died within a few months but I Would go visit him and I would try to talk to him about God but he wasn't interested at all and he was even more vision outdoors because of the diagnosis\nHe had died he died in such a terrible state he died in the state and I want you to die and uh I I felt\nLike helpless form now in my religion George was told that people fall into hell like snowflakes from the sky especially if no one to pray for them\nSo I started praying for him and all these other people that I knew and bonded with and I felt they were friends of mine and I would ask God you know don't send these cells to held it unless you go to hell until I finished praying for them\nNo matter how long ago it gives me on this planet no matter how many grains of sand they still got left and an hourglass that's what I was going to do and I believe now that was the free breakfast at of why this human creature this compelled to assess my house and I'll build that mosaic FOIA piece by piece right down to every single detail\nKnow do what we can really as you well let me ask you this little John did this demon follow you to the house basically or was it already there\nAbsolutely not you know the only absolutely not\nI've never had like a and I've never you know I never had ... invited to speak to here I never had to say on I never use ... more I never use terror card I mean I I Believe that opens the door for creature like just to come in and then also just anybody does that because I\nNow I think if you allowed to speak to to come in hillbilly you harm I think if admitting him it was worse you know you're the only other time it has\nNo there's no doubt if you view invited in each call me\nYeah that's what I Believe now but you do is\nAbsolutely not dressed I've learned a lot from it I learned that it is and has a methodology we'll talk with discuss that too but the only other really other time [noise] ah well you know I thought that I worked in ... that's why I wrote that book anyhow ... best selling book and then if you're interested in any of that do have some funny stories about the rapid Chris\nBrown that's that's the topic we don't touch me down last which we don't we don't get into that topic oh okay [laughter] so anyway\nPeople and finally wind to was basically what you've seen on the outside but go ahead\nYeah okay so the idea that\nTo was basically what you've seen on the outside but going up\nYeah okay so the only other time that I ever\nKnew about a person who encountered the demon that I Believe was because my brother my brother's fault he we had just a rare or a blood disease that runs in the family and my my dad was unfortunate to get it and it killed them very early in the sixties had a heart attack and\nDied a think tank gunner brother was unfortunate for there to get are you OK get that she has me are you are right\nYet what with the ...\nOh I haven't I I've been checked with that yeah oh yeah ah the doctor who well let me tell you what happened to fall in I'll tell you\nSo poorly breaks up and he has the same symptoms my dad had spent eight dollars nine one one they can they come and they take 'em to the hospital and at the hospital he died I found a hospital bed and when I went to visit him later on he said to me Johnny you know\nAnd I heard that he died on hospital but after the doctors told me said Johnny when I died on a hospital bed I left my body\nHe said I left my body and I watched that doctors frantically\nTrying to get me back to life again if they'd be late and not uncommon needles\nAnd yeah and the alarms going off and said like when I talk about that fifth fifth dimension a spiritual dimension he stepped into that for him and he was still so he's still thought he was in the hospital room because he could see what was going on with his body they said in the hospital\nHe said to me ... ... and it and then there was a dark side of that room he said and demons came from a small team is not like big when factory for for for toys I came to me\nAnd it was gripped me and was starting to pull me answer that talk area of the room which I which I say is to because they are they overlap some types and I believe

I had three boys here growing up and I think a little bit bigger they want to a little more room so I had the basements finished and er I cut in half and it had the apartment bills down near so my first wife that's all he wants to more space that he moved down there yeah you have your own interests\nYou pull your own spawn come and go as you want so you\nYeah so it's nice so then he goes to college and he moves out second boy wants to parliament and so he takes it he goes to college and moved out my third boy he wants out of farming he ... he was in there he he was he had this whole time so he uh when I had the\nHe was the smart one free rent\nYeah well I didn't mind you I Believe that we had this big house and then like when he he he went to college he moved out but he got a job\nAnd then he said you know can I moved back home I just want to start my own business as they come back home because I mean we got its big house and my wife has this empty nest syndrome sure you know what I mean so and I like having to a company to somebody to come upstairs and have dinner with you once in a while when when you saw him he wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then he's got a great often he took his but anyway he's you know the whole time\nSo that the upstairs\nDid you once in a while when when you saw him he wasn't home that much but he's moved out since then you've got a great often he took it but anyway he's you know the whole time\nSo that the upstairs and so in the basement you come in that that I enjoy just steps that go up to the kitchen\nWas a big kitchen the okay if you're in that case and you can almost hear that door open and close and then next to the kitchen is living ... most of the time George and uh that's what I like I\nI go to the gym in the morning then I meditate in the afternoon I meditate in at night and meditate so I have a pretty long for a life that I took I did get back to my artwork because I Am good at it as a small little town that God gave me you know so uh I'm doing that and everything's fine to it for years and I've been praying for the last ... and I felt will last those\nEvery day for years and I was like I said I'm going to do that until\nWhatever time I have left here so everything's fine oh and then a bank yeah\nSo then yeah I'm sitting I'm sitting in the living room and that I endorse downstairs I'm by myself and I hear that I enjoy I slam lucky you normally wouldn't even hear it\nFrom in the in the living room but here it's slanted like it never was slammed before and I'm thinking to myself\nWhen you know somebody's open\nOh absolutely you in the house at twenty five years you know every noise in the house you know\nSo I'm thinking I said what was it was I don't think my wife could even if she came home and sleep like I don't even think you're getting slammed the door that hard\nAnd maybe my son can I don't know why he would do that let's say at a car accident or with a girlfriend broke up with them or something like that so I'm thinking what is that I get up I go to the kitchen I look downstairs usually when somebody comes in down near the ... the lights on still talk to you so I go into the\n... I have a a surveillance system here right they look into the cameras and I wrote back to the cameras and Fifteen twenty minutes I said nobody was on the property I look at the cameras that face the garage doors nobody nobody open those garage doors and look at the camera the faces that store in the back nobody went through that fact door\n... and er which you know once you distinctly hurdle\nOh absolutely slam no like slant\nI didn't know at at the time so that we're going to discuss this creature was using his methodology on me and had a method it wasn't it was telling me that wasn't here for social call that wasn't passenger with\nNow explain that in a minute so I go I look in the cameras nobody was on a property in the basement I got I got bars on the windows but you can get out as a you know if there was a fire in a house or you just on lock them and jumped out too so I Know he couldn't get anybody if somebody was trust me I think I couldn't see them so I go I turn the lights on in the basement I go down to the basement\nAnd it's not looking everywhere\nAnd then you you're pretty convince you think somebody's in the house don't you\nOh absolutely absolutely\nBut I the only problem is but\nWhen I'm looking around I feel like I've been in the past twenty five years I feel if menacing sinister I'm In is like the only word to describe this like evil like an\nEvil then I ...\nYeah I'm looking everywhere I look down through the steps and like any where somebody could squeezed himself into behind a washer and dryer and my son's room underneath his bed in his closet you know and the furniture to him I look I look at my friend take a look and I still have this horrible feeling\n[noise] so I'm thinking well I I Know I looked at some satisfy looking to the cameras nobody came and nobody broken but I still have this really menacing sinister feeling I come upstairs and I sit down\nAnd I'm thinking about it and then I you know and then all of a sudden I hear\nThis wedding steps between the basement and and and and the kitchen and here's something I really heavy because like I\nCould hear when my wife comes up to ... hundred and twenty pounds my son comes up to ... hundred and Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down\nLike where I guess something very silly crushing they'll step and thinking to myself I just checked down here you know nothing\nThan Seventy pounds I Know what those steps down like where I guess something very silly crushing those steps\nAnd thinking to myself I just checked down here you know nothing was here\n... coming up to ... ...\nYeah I feel something very heavy slowly coming up the steps I get up again I go over that I look there's nobody there so I'm thinking\nWe were you harmed her own armed at this time\nI I have I have a a registered gun you know you do okay [laughter] but I but I didn't\nSee anything so you know what I mean I looked in the cameras that look through the cameras if I were to fill us something then I I I didn't feel like a you know but I don't think I I kinda was wondering if I had that feeling of something very menacing sinister\nAnd I think it is but could this possibly the but then I tried to shake it off because he like I'm just the guy I don't think that's you know it's\nGoing to and what have you on where you convinced that there was this creature demon in the house\nTaylor the real estate guy I'd help Nevada residents buy and sell over five thousand homes since Nineteen Ninety four\nOver forty eight realty is proud to partner with the Nevada broadcasters association in recognizing the Nevada military support alliance Nevada servicemen and women are battle born and often stand in harm's way to fight for our freedom which some giving the ultimate sacrifice I'm Erin tailor the real estate guy and I am Nevada proud\nSponsored by ... cooperation with a better Rochester association the mistakes from the justice to heart\nNo home loans studios twenty am north Las Vegas ...

an opening sufficient for my head\nI put in a dark line through all close close that no light show now\nAnd then I rushed in my head or you would have left to see how commonly I trusted in I moved slowly very very slowly so that I might not disturb the old man sleep\nIt took me an hour to place my whole head within the opening so far that I could see him as he lay upon his bed oh what a madman events so wise as this and then when my head was well in the room\nI ended that lantern cautiously also cautiously cautiously for the hinges creek I and did it just so much that a single then re fell upon the vulture I\nEnd this I did for seven long nights every night just at midnight but I found the ... always closed and so it was impossible to do the work\nFort was not the old man who ... me but he is evil lie and every morning when the day broke I went boldly into the chamber and spoke courageously to him calling him by name and a hearty tone and inquiring how he has passed the night\nSo you see he would have been a very profound old man indeed to suspect that every night just at twelve I looked in upon him while he slept\nUpon the eighth night I was more than usually cautious and opening the door a watches emitted hand moves more quickly than did mine never before that night had I felt the extent of my own powers of mice aghast city I could scarcely contain my feelings of trying\nTo think that there I was opening the door and little by little and he not even to dream of my secret deeds or thoughts are fairly chuckled at the idea and perhaps he heard me for a moved on the bed certainly as if startled\nNow you may think that I drew back but you know\nIs a room was this black is pitch with the sick darkness for the shutters were close fastened through fear of robbers\nAnd so I knew that he could not see the opening of the door and I kept pushing it on steadily steadily I had my head in and was about to open that lantern when my phone's slipped upon the tin fascinating and the old man's sprang up in bed crying out who's there\nI kept quite still and said nothing for a whole hour I did not move a muscle and in the meantime I did not hear him lie down\nHe was still sitting up in the bed listening just as I have done night after night Harkin into the death watches and the wall presently I heard a slight grown then I knew what was the grownup mortal terror it was not a grown the pain or of grief it was the low stifled sound that arises from the bottom of the soul when overcharged\nWith all I\nMany a night just at midnight when the old world slapped it was wild up from my own ... deepening with its dreadful echo the terrorists that distracted me I say I knew it well I knew what the old man felt pity him although I chuckled at heart\nI knew that he had been lying awake ever since the first slight noise when he turned into bed his fears had been ever since growing upon him\nHe had been trying to fancy them cause less but could not he had been saying to

G v or gas tonight for the first hour is ed Rome and he is a Canadian musician\nAlso a paranoid Suzie is his website is ed Roman dot net and we welcome him to the program he had welcome to be on reality radio\nHey thanks so much and glad to be here\nNow that you're coming up so now I'm at what point I Know you're a musician a in a ... but at what point did that paranormal enthusiast become part of how you describe yourself\nYou know I ... I guess we're all defined by our experiences and at the same time or limitations but um you know there's so many things that happened to you over a course of your life or or a period of time\nAnd I think um that all sorts of sort of chalk itself up on the on the belt loop is things you just can't dismissing\nI'll always think people will you know they consider certain things circumstances are coincidence inside of those circumstances and you know a police investigation will consider you know something like that in the lead and and for me when things are happening in sort of a staggering fashion\nSometimes I I have to go wait a minute ... there's something happening here I'm In it then then at the same time growing up with it I guess you know it's been part of my\nFamily allegory as far as like my grandmother telling stories about stuff from the old country classic you know sitting around the kitchen table at dinnertime and and I guess you you become sort of almost like hyper aware\nAnd and some people say well you know your your aunt from or ... or something some in some situation as a result the feeling that we're in a way but you know some of the circumstances\nOr like you know I I should have put money down on the water because I Would have one in terms of like one to a trillion in terms of that's him next to impossible for that to occur as far as being coincidence\nSo we talked about these experiences that she told this for you or what type of experiences we talking about\nWell most recent I mean I had a friend pass away I'm a number of years ago but you know it seems like yesterday to me but uh so I'm we're at the way\nI go outside I see these three kids that are walking by their their telling a story about how they're they're they're involved in a sort of delinquent activity\nAnd and I I'm I'm sitting there arbitrarily kind of like over here in the subject and I go well listen you know like I have to stop you for a second and I think they were worried I was going to like you know turn the men or something and it was like no you have to understand what you guys are talking about right now\nHappened with me in a good friend of mine that just passed away when you were about your age and we did this exact same thing I said look at if I go back in in here nobody is going to believe me so would you please you know follow me back and so I can tell them what happened\nAnd as we go in and and you know those people were head you know what's going on and I'm like hey let's not have to tell you something I explain it was in place goes quiet everybody's like pale face\nAnd I said what's wrong and I and they said we were just telling that story and and I and I\nSee those things and I go to my ... I say to myself well look at you know ... what are the chances of me leaving the room at that point to go outside what are the chances that these three kids would have done the exact same thing\nAnd I'd be there to hear it in that ... for a moment late at night and then go upstairs with these three kids to try to prove this is what happened to me 'cause you're always looking for proof and I started interesting that that was happening and and they're they are talking about\nAnd and I go to myself this is there's a bigger and I don't know I Can't fully explain what the meaning is to me it's my friend going hey buddy\nYou know I'm Still here ah and and I love you in a way because he was a trickster and he loved to have fun with life and in that exemplifies\nExactly what you know in terms of like look you know I'm going to play around you should be perfect as far as the scenario was concerned\nSo that that to me in most recently um you know it's something that has really punctuated my my thought process above above that kind of a thing\nAnd this has been going on these types of things for you for a sexually your whole life\nYeah I mean in my ... people in my family in general I sit around with my mum sometimes and talk with her and\nMy mom like well hey you know do you suppose this all happened to like us and she's like well we're we're\nYou know or or whatever we joke about it and stuff and and and she goes I don't know you know ... ... I mean even the the ... you know like people are like oh here's had with his family UFO story it's like\nYou know when you're young everything that your your family says especially when they're older is greatly impressionable on a young person and you cannot help but like\nYou know your ears perk up because the room goes silent and the story unfolds and and you you know so like you know my mom would say well you know\nI don't know why it happened to us but you know we have you know in an incident that occurred my my mom was making dinner one night all of a sudden\nThe pipes in the sink started Radley like underneath the sink and the windows were vibrating a little bit and she was worried that there was something wrong with the some pomp or the furnace\nOr or or Sunday so she went to the basement nothing was arm came back upstairs and the the stairs gave way to like a big bay window and she immediately like ducked down because she thought like a small ... aircraft\nWould've gone to like hit the house\nAnd then she she realized after a couple of seconds she's like wait a minute nothing's happened and and then she she said well what is that like in like my grandparents' brothers and sisters\nWe all looked out the window and there was this like all of lights\nOr you will have a series of\nSort of glowing light that were around the bottom of it there were almost like a vortex of lights the world into themselves and\nIt was very bright almost like an art light according to the story didn't cast shadows even though it was late night time you know treat didn't cast shadows or you know fence posts didn't cast shadows and then it it sort of lift it up and it ... my mom's that bounce a ball\nLike follow the topography the landscape and then the next day because of the staff of the things we live close to a little airport and they had reported some stuff in the local newspapers about tracking some things they couldn't explain and the observatory there was a pure and released a couple of reports about it\nSo that kind of like solidified stuff for me because it was attached to those little what was in the paper\nRight you know well it's always it's always um I guess comforting in a way to get some kind of a third party a confirmation that what you experienced isn't something that you experienced alone\nNo credibility to this too\nWe're talking with ed Roman uh for the first hour of our program to nineties a Canadian musician ended paranormal enthusiasts we've just a beginner conversation with that you can visit his website and Roman dot net and we're going to continue the conversation on the other side of the break\nIn the phone number's eight four four six eight seven six six nine dental for you date for four six eight seven seven six six now you'll ... v beyond really radio will be back after this\nFrom the soup that she made that she felt that he'll people with cancer\nAnd she believes this and some doctors of some people that were diagnosed with because she would even like there was like verbal spells I Will go or like limbs oh gee you know like with the Italian community knows what you've why my grandmother did make you have to go away by you know burning use ...\nFrom corn brooms seven you know little with us from it and it's spelled with a glass of water that gets cast those the back door and\nSo this this was like huh commonplace like what do we have for breakfast wait a minute and you know what's what's going on right it goes way back\nWell but some must quickly jumped to our phone lines we have Chris from Missouri who wants to weigh in you Chris welcome to the program\nHigh it will be on the show and thank you what's on your mind\nWell first of all I have to say that don't change [laughter] any\nAnyway I was going to pay a story about a this happened about\n... the ... when a fixed and came out without Bruce Willis ...\nYeah my parents well anyway we're at the drive and we did a family thing we had there was probably six couples and probably ten kids and what are the father's\nRan a local um I got to be by the ... and so he bought tickets for the kids anyway there was in the back of the ... the one kid was cry and cry and cry and cry and cry and you know and I would get very annoyed because I'm trying to watch it and it's right at the moment when you find out what happened you know when you figure out the movie\nAnd my daughter kept saying mom mom mom and my great hold on hold on the line\nLike mom you know it I think just to me all about that kind of one of the moms came over and she got what can she pointed up in the sky\nWell it looked like a Roman candle Bob the bigger it was just you know shooting straight down and when they're playing behind it and I was like oh wow it it can lead to write and about that time it stopped\nIt bounced when they stopped and I'm like oh no it's not\nIt hit back and forth at down sideways you know several times and then it gets split into two diagonally\nWhile right after that you're ... fighter jet I mean we were\nEver going after it\nI thought it was interesting that weekend there was a ... at the air force base they had a on air show that we can and then there was also one of the downtown Kansas City airport now whether that\nWith what we saw that it was awesome I don't know what it was\nInteresting to do with rain were there any media reports subsequent to that so you know\nI mean it unless there's nowhere near that stop any balance all\nJust like I I look back at it and found that fact I got like you know and it just stuck literally stopped\nAnd then it went ... you know diagnosed diet and Afghanistan really fast and then it gets split into have when one went last night right diagnosis\nIs one God just done\nYeah I have another\nStory about face recognition that happened at the federal belly and downtown Kansas City you hear it\nYeah it was you have to make a quick on this one\nOkay well I wouldn't want there to file can papers for myself\nI don't want to go away anything you know I Need to go down there there's some things I have to file to sell on account of taking care of my dad he's standing next Kenny tending to secret terrorists guy command and they they ... you need to kind of like that and held him away and like oil what's going on\nAnyway he had had some kind of as a protest there in the eighties like Nineteen eighty five\nThis happened in two thousand and ten they recognize them and escorted in that building\nOh well yeah it's been around a long time because it has been willing thank you so much Chris for calling in and sharing that with this and the story about the object in the air that looked like the media and then just stopped me to morality movements and then split\nUm does that edge sounded all like the the orbits dreams that you were discussing earlier\nNo ... to me and my mum likes she describes a craft that that almost seem to like lift off and they're like the fact that there was this sort of description of these lights that were on the bottom half of this sort of like H shaped or ...\nWhat what sort of gave way to the idea that it was some kind of a of a craft because she ... she was also talking to a pilot friend of hers that said well what you know like\nWhat has life like this and the guys like I don't I don't know what I was lifelike like and it was silent but everything was vibrating and she is she's she described it in and everybody's recollection moved over the barn moved in a self easterly fashion\nWe live on farmlands ... undulating profiles of the topography so it was almost like actually following the landscape and they lost sight of it you know as a dipped into the valley is heading heading south\nEast of where we live so\nAnd I guess that's the other thing my dad wasn't there he was out of the council meeting that night when he came home and my mom and my family wouldn't he's like oh you're crazy and so the next day my mom's got the paper see I told you you know like we were not crazy right like\nSo that was also why it was part of the you know the story like in the next day you know it was in the paper because I guess a lot of people had seen something and they report it and I remember that time frame to even in the early seventies of\nMy family be huddled around the TV\nWe only had three or four stations and there'd be some report coming in from somewhere in there you know people saw this that and the other thing you know cut the commercial\nUm but again it was like wow you know something happened here to my family they have a hard time explaining what it was but this is what we think it was\nBecause I don't think it was plaza mower swamp gas or\nYou know and the other thing is I mean I you know [laughter] it from an aerial perspective we live on on an old ... system and and that particular area itself I Know creeks and water systems or you know currents of water really carry subtle bits of energy but\nIf I was flying in an aircraft or something was going on and I needed to follow something a creek or river system would eventually lead me to a lake or an ocean or\nSomething to that effect so I could understand a coastline or more about the area but you know I'm only speculating obviously it's just it's enough for me to know that that that everybody is like you know it happened and and that's that's what's most important\nWhat we're going to run out of time talking with you and we haven't even touched on the whole sasquatch sightings you and your experience so why don't you know these things that you've experienced yourself or these experiences that your family members that\nWell the ... I'm going it sasquatch but really you know to tell you the truth like I'm Still processing it and\nIn some cases have some fear of going back to the forest that's backed by my place ox planted quickly like I mean look we have coyotes in the area and my dog has been chased we have a big garden\nGrow a lot of food or I'm going to the garden coyotes with the dog I I can hear them in the back forty and they're going crazy so the dog put them in the house\nAnd I go back and there's got to be like an alarming amount of them and their Yelping and yet usually they're either fighting or telling something apart or something on\nA and there I see this in the first impression I have is this what is the person doing and a jump black jumpsuit like Scooby Doo suit and a bell a club in July\nAnd it's facing the forest where these highways are I Can't see them I hear them Yelping but they refused to come on\nThis thing all within about and I'm I'm kind of coming up to the crust of the hill looking down on the slope of the hill so I'm coming up to this and seeing as it usually is I'm approaching the crust of the hill\nAnd and all of a sudden it ... it coaches down and I lose sight of it because there's a lot of like big raspberry bushes and grape vines and stuff that's in the lower part\nIt both out of there I go down on one knee and almost start to like wanna leave 'cause I'm unsure of what it is on four legs it's ...\nAnd it crosses an alarming amount of space I Can't be the true judge of it and you know I mean close to fifty feet in like four downs and at this point it looks it looks felt when I was looking at it and I thought you know 'cause in which turned it had a very large mass\nLike almost like a football player but it was running like a Jack rabbits\nAnd then it stopped stood up on two feet turned to its laugh\nAnd walked across forty half for forty five acres on those two eggs and kept going over a fence line on two legs into the next set of bushes\nAnd I lost sight of it now at this point I was so afraid I crawled\nBack from where I was 'cause I was in a half January flexing have looking over my shoulder what's gonna happen here am I going to be attacked visited there and and went back to the house and started to try to process what happened but it took me months\nTo go back there I Can't talk to contact to John in during the end goal was a well known biologist and if there was just about the subject he turned me on to some people here\nYou know a curio that are part of the researchers organization for this kind of stuff they came up here we did a bunch of looking around I mean this was already ... months after the fact", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "04"}
