S. S. U. International Space station what are they doing up there\nI think we're watching for alien mostly I mean maybe\nIt'll British TV show what would the UFO er that space intruder detectors that they called it up I think it got to our version that said I mean I don't I don't know what else are you and they're not doing a whole heck of a lot of science and it seems\nLike we're at the point where either we should just build this thing out and expand it and turn it into Babylon five or something or we should just give up and let it crashed down to the markets with one of those two because we're at a turning point I think and are we going to go forward with an American manned space program or not it really have time for us to make that they\nOff because they're gonna they're gonna comes out on our dollar\nYeah oh yeah that will come back and and now we also have demographic research that will tell people which parts of the world which types of companies will come back stronger or not so that's an extra advantage goal you know imagine if you could buy gold at four to seven hundred dollar next time it\nGoes to four thousand instead of two thousand so no that that's the real advantage when when they correct as much it happens quickly\nThese big corrections happen on and only two or three years and then you get to buy what what my previous book was called the sale of a lifetime that that nothing nothing beach that the problem is most people lose all their money or their house goes down fifty percent of their stocks go down at the present and they don't have any net worth left to buy things when\nThey're well what did the indicators marketed the last two days is really what's the cause is it just ... what's happening\nWhat will will to things in and actually they both relate back to the good old Donald\nHum last week you saw 'em treasury bond you you know the yields on on the risk free ten and thirty year\nBonds shoot up I'm rather dramatically and we were predicting this would happen we said look at the thirty year treasury bond breaks above through three point two percent it's probably going to go to a four point three percent in less than a year and that's going to raise mortgage rates and that hurts stocks because now bonds are more attractive and\nStock values are based on you know low interest rates are higher for stock values and higher lowered so\nYou know that that was the first thing that but the second thing is you know concerns over China I mean this this trade war yes it may be a good thing to do in China may be cheating in a lot of ways by\nChina's been the fastest growing economy in the world it's already stalling and slowing and now it's slowing more in the markets are concerned oh my gosh\nIf China keeps slowing here that's going to trigger a worldwide a downturn and crash and so so it was rising interest rates\nAnd um and and and more you know concerns about China it's market just broke a key point we've been talking about\nFor the last month at twenty six forty I'm you know that doesn't sound like much but it was fifty five hundred not you know and then a few years ago it crashed\nForty five percent of three months and then I have this kind of limp rally for years and has been waiting to go back down and we said look it breaks twenty six forty that that's a sign that China is starting to go down again and it and it did that and the last two days it's a twenty five eighty right now so that's another sign\nThat there's something wrong and then again that was the biggest concern a lot of people keep thinking\nOh it's just more interest rates note the interest rates was the first whack these last three days had a lot more to do with China and Trump is really pushing this trade war and it is dangerous even though it may be a good policy and a lot of ways\nAnd Trump has been boosting the economy would tax cuts and all this sort of stimulus and stuff and that causes inflation to go up which it has and it causes gross to go up temporarily and what does the Federal Reserve going to do they're going to raise interest rates that's what they do it the economy's overheating they raise interest rates if\nIt's slowing the lower interest rates which they now they've done for nine years which is ridiculous and and and now Trump screaming oh my gosh you know I've created this great thing and the trumps wrecking at no\nIt's predictable he's not you know he's got some you know gut feelings we got to do this and that he's not savvy at all when it comes to the consequences of things and the economic impacts he basically is probably the prime reason for this\nUm pull back now it hasn't gotten dangerous yet but it came right to that um\nYesterday's close one happening like you were you in a couple more D's downturns tomorrow we have another five hundred point drop I mean then people started saying there's something wrong\n[noise] yes yes we were just at that point we we have to remember we had a we had a crush on like this at the beginning of the year markets peaked in late January real kind of like blow off top classic thing and then that that was looking like it could have been a tough\nWe have a correction a sharp correction just like this it was down about ten to twelve percent different markets but then it stopped\nAnd and and it stopped right about here you know where we are now and then it kinda like went sideways and then it came back up that's the trick George I've learned from when when you got above all of this magnitude\nWhat happens when it does finally burst in and that's when the smart money finally says okay this things over and they start selling and shorting to market it happened very quickly you'll see and I've seen this the last seven\nStock bubbles throughout the history of everything from the Nikkei in the early nineties and the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty two crashing and every other one in the last century including the tech wreck in recent bubbles\nThat first crash will be forty two percent on average in the first two and a half\nMonths with people get walk\nThat's the sign that that's the only way you know that the bubble has finally birth the problem is by the time that comes people already in trouble and they're panicking and they get whacked hard so with the danger sign is if we keep going down and and and literally I the markets do look like they're going to open up tomorrow but that'd be that's just a bounce after\nYou know fourteen hundred points and may open up two to three hundred points tomorrow that's nothing so far but it is bouncing off a critical level we've been warning our subscribers\nSeventeen hundred on the S. and P. five hundred and twenty five thousand them down if the market breaks that that's the first sign that something's wrong and yes the markets and the traders\nAre going to take that as a bad sign and you'll see another steep sell off and then the odds keep going up\nThat this is a top and it it is a is a top we've got not\nFifty fifty four percent like last crashes can be more like Seventy eighty percent or more over a few years and and again the first half of that crash will happen in the first two to three months typically and that's what make bubbles so dangerous\nUm uh you know the Rothschild guy Baron Ross trial once you know when somebody asked ... what was the secret his wealth in the Eighteen hundreds I think he was the wealthiest man of the world he said you know I always sold a bit early\nBecause that's our level to this is a bubble this isn't a normal bull market\nThat correct so nice staircase manner and goes down bubbles go up dramatically and they crash and in half the time and they crashed twice as dramatically so so that's why I warn people so hard on this\nThis is a once in a lifetime of vent and it it the science to me you're building we've been telling people man this looks like a top here in the dining top here and we only get\nThe good part is we can gauge as if we only get a normal ten Fifteen Percent or so corruption by the end of the year then we'll probably good for one more route one more Trump rally into next year before this thing blows but the right now\nOdds are shifting towards a it's already happening so people should be on alert\nThe two thousand seven two thousand they subprime mortgage crisis will this be as bad as that time period\n[noise] ... well this is worse because what's happened is that we did and we of course we were warning about that George ... decades in advance on demographics the baby boom picking\nAnd and and and causing a down turn out to the greatest boom in history but but also the subprime crisis was the trigger and we also had record debt levels I mean I'm Around the world but especially in developed countries what happened after the two thousand eight nine crash is we had a big debt bubble in emerging countries\nAnd then of course China's been off the charts for now for Thirty years and and their dad has grown sixty four times just since two thousand just in the last Seventeen Eighteen years so\nLow interest rates and the quantitative easing policies of central banks around the world made borrowing easy for emerging countries hate developed countries too but we were already too much in debt so we just kinda like went sideways and didn't the leverage our debt emerging countries want on his free and they added sixty to Seventy\nTrillion war on top of two hundred and thirty trillion and now we're at three hundred trillion in debt and financial asset bubbles around the world\nAnd and those are cracking you see turkey blowing up you see Venezuela with hyperinflation runs in trouble\nChina is flowing and and like I said they have the biggest that Bob ... of anybody in any time in history and when China blows that we're we're going to be worse so so\nMy view is no this is going to be worse than the two thousand two thousand nine recession and the stock crash because they stopped that with massive money printing they just literally stop that they just build the pop back up with money that was draining\nThis time more debt\nEverything's more stretched the emerging world is now in debt and they always go down harder than we do and they always have worse debt bubble crashes and stuff and we do so this is going to be worse so instead of uh like I said earlier instead of a\nFifty four percent crash look for Seventy to eighty but\nShe was absolutely huge and that doesn't mean that companies are doing bad here we stay with us we'll talk about that when we come back here yes dance with us his website is his name Harry Dent D. E. N. T. dot com couple of his books include the Democrat demographic cliff the Salem a lifetime and zero\nGhost insiders the new version of that goes to ... am Abu ... bone in now Android ... listen libre on demand anywhere anytime good at ... dot com and downloaded today [noise]\n[noise] right again well any time you get a major downturn recession or stock price like that some companies will get under pressure and they will go under or have to go through chapter eleven bankruptcy or restructure that's a good thing recessions are necessary the Federal Reserve and governments the recession's bad thing\nThey're good things um but and then you want to buy the company that survive you know we had the dot com crash that was a super bubble I mean the tech bubble took five years the bill but the dot com crash came in the last year and a half\nA six to seven times kind of like the big point bubble here recently cracked and a lot of companies when other well which what were the survivors will companies like apple and Amazon if it apart Amazon there oh my God I was\nYou know like a you know a hundred and fifty dollars that now it's like you know gotten up to you know sixteen hundred or something like that so that's the time to buy the best companies and you want to look at who are the strongest companies okay those are the ones that are actually get the most overvalued in a bubble like this but they're also\nGo down I mean General Motors in the Nineteen twenty nine to thirty to crash went down Ninety three percent that ended up being that was it ended up being the greatest company in the world for decades after that you could have bought it for nothing so\nThat's the secret and and the other thing is even if the earnings of companies if companies are so good\nThat they keep their earnings flat instead of declining the valuations stock how many times earnings white people will pay thirty times earnings for the typical stock right now or forty\nAnd and sixty or eighty for the best tax on those collapse just because investors get fearful and so a stock and go down fifty percent even if its earnings don't decline and then of course most companies' earnings do decline so that's how they end up down eighty percent\nHere you say you have a secret indicator for looking at some of the dangers what is that\n[noise] yeah yeah you know how it it's called the smart money\nYou know if you tell us it's not a secret anymore well I Know\nBelieve me Wall Street won't if there's any way you don't have to worry but but what what happened that they're the smart money or the people who who kind of push ups stopping in ...\nJumping and by when when when they see the old investors are over bought in stocks over about they're the ones that short first I mean they're in the know and and and they can even watch what all of us are doing their the sharks that eat all of us minnows that's how they make money they're they're the best traders and stuff well they you can measure\nThis action what there's an index from Bloomberg called the smart money flow index\nAnd what they do is that dumb money ... acts in the morning the first thirty minutes I mean because the biggest moves in the market come overnight again the smart money the traders have already made their positions and the futures markets there ahead of everything\nAnd so the market's gonna open down it opens down right at the open or it opens up if it's going to jump most of the moves that may well that's when the dumb money and most people would stop or something to protect themselves bats when those reactions made that's the ...\nThe smart money watches the market during the day they can even running and jumping tested a little bit and shorter do this\nThey make their positions in the last half hour into the clothes so they measure this indicator measures let the smart money is doing versus the dumb money and the smart money\nHas not bought this rally in fact they've been shore to get they've been betting against this rally ever since that bottom February this year after that crap now they bought into the last rally they bought into the Trump rally they bought into the to\nJanuary top early this year but once that crash happened they have not bought him this rally and it's been one of the deepest declined some smart money buying and that has\nBeen a strong warning signal to me in in recent months into our subscribers\nAre you in Puerto Rico on them\nI Am in Puerto Rico and I went through hurricane worse than Michael I had to hold my windows from blowing up my condo it was so bad it was unbelievable because the difference between Maria here\nAnd Michael both of them similar force but this storm hung over us for twelve to fourteen hours in Michael at least pass through so I Know what these people are going through it is unbelievable\nUh to watch everything I mean windows blowing off all around me you know you walk out the next morning and the all the leaves are off trees and you know everything you know blown over and stuff it it it's just unbelievable it's like can you know God's got angry or something you know into through a temper tantrum\nShe'd moved there well I moved there because I had a vacation home I've been working on for years and coal labor which is one of the Virgin Islands but it's in Puerto Rico people don't know that Puerto Rico has ... in Calais wrote\nTo islands that are like St Thomas and or or St Croix or St John\nAnd and you know no passport to come there is a U.S territory so I was building a house there in in I was in Tampa we'd been care taking my wife's family for many many years had to move from Miami we're about to move back to Miami but I'm we're down here working on this place\nSpending more time in San Juan which has gotten much better in the last decade was when I first started coming\nIn I said to my why don't we move here we're in a condo that's a quarter of the price of beach front top quality on a corner the price of South Beach Miami where we're used to live\nAnd and we're now I go around the corner from my condo to the small local airport which I get to twenty minutes in advance they don't even check your id they just wait to see how you're going to ...\nI'm not sure I liked that part well it's\nFine but it it's a thirty minute low altitude plane flight had seen it\nOn on I leave my condo doing and landing on this island in one hour and once I got down here I realized I I could qualify for some tax advantages here which are very compelling I mean anybody that trade stocks or or\nIn the crypto geyser coming down here because of that\nAnd businesses that can qualify there's real strong tax advantages so I'm living much cheaper than a man of great climate I can still fly to New York\nIn four hours director in Miami and two hours and almost anywhere in the east coast is now it's difficult if I'm coming out your way if I'd have to go out to California which I just did for a long way that that the long haul now but I tell ya I\nI like it down here they've been in a recession there's no civil unrest a recession for twelve years we're about to have a civil war between blue and red factions and we got three point seven percent unemployment they got twelve to Fifteen Percent ear and I don't see any civil unrest so I feel good down here for now\nAnd then I'm just going to see what happens in the next uh so many years the big banks down there\n[noise] yeah yeah yeah about ... and ... down here and actually a lot of the banks are by bank of popular and Santander or Spanish Banks because this is by origin more of a Spanish\nCountry but you know and we've got most of the big box stores and ice malls and stop but there are George my biggest problem with a lot of people on the on Amazon and the Internet don't realize that you can ship here on the U.S postal service so people\nEither John [laughter] or they think we're in Zimbabwe or they charge some huge X and there's a lot of things little things I used to get on the Internet free I Can't find here that's my biggest frustration I Can't find my radios special pasta sauce and things like otherwise man this is a good deal and\nYou know I'm Down here for other reasons but I'd say people ought to be Americans\nOught to be consider retiring here housing in general is sixty percent lower\nEducation for for people's ah kids it's sixty percent lower a\nNaval in our elections I don't know how many Americans really understand that that they are allowed to vote in our elections\n... most important they are allowed to freely move for immigrate they don't have to even apply and and most Puerto Rico a lot of young people they get a a an inexpensive good education here the education system here is good\nThen they moved to the U.S where they can make twice as much and how much better job opportunities and then when they get older and have kids guess what they do a lot of the Puerto Ricans will move back to Puerto Rico to put their kids\nTo colleges or dental school or medical school here and save a ton of money and then\nSometimes a lot of times I'll just stay and retire here but but also a lot of older Puerto Ricans now are moving to the United states why sixty two percent of all Puerto Ricans are in the U.S and most of them now are moving to Florida\nAnd so these these older people realize their kids and or their grandkids are in the U.S and they end up moving to the U.S so the U.S is getting highly educated good immigrants\nFrom Puerto Rico in Puerto Rico keeps losing people match why they have these tax programs the IRS decides and the government decides the U.S is better to help create good jobs down here the tax advantages rather than just out and out subsidized Puerto Rico because\nThe U.S as always always rubbing their best people and again it it's they're more professional educated people that are leaving not the not the everyday people so it's actually a good deal for the U.S\nSo I Want you to you is your best impressions on what you think will happen economic lead over the next year this country seems to be mired right now we're eating in a conflict\nYou

S. like there is in Puerto Rico now and that is one difference\nThese Puerto Ricans are not um don't have that sort of tension and that polarity that's the one thing I can tell you I'm sitting here and I haven't even seen a bar fight there the last any crime where where I Am\nHere is the fact that the Hispanics in most African Americans you wrote in a democratic\nBig deal ... what what was his point\nWhile he well he's saying that that you know the the RED People don't like that these are people that are going to vote blue and we got this blue red war so when they see Puerto Ricans he's saying come to Rochester well we don't like him and he said they're not as high skilled while I'm telling you in Orlando they're not saying that they're they are basically\nA reinvigorated Orlando there's four ... four hundred and fifty thousand Puerto Ricans now in just Orlando and a million\nIn Florida and those million which which she is right about our children to vote all all the key Senate races up and guess who they're appealing to\nThose Puerto Ricans the Republican and the Democrats Rick Scott and Bill Nelson running for Senate in their boat courting the Puerto Ricans 'cause they're five percent of the vote and that's enough to swing an election and they do ...\nWhat are you I'm a crowd of ... what our democracy ...\nYes it is it is\nLet's go to Greg in New Jersey taken away Gregory\nRight yes my question Georgia and good morning I'm just like to say I live in a congressional district in northern New Jersey\nWe get thirty percent of our federal tax dollars back the blue states subsidize the red states and the and the state to receive the most was Kentucky with an idiot McConnell was on the uh the strides me nuts if the microbes for fifty years we subsidize the south in the southwest the northeast does an SOS the mid west\nAnd I'm ... I'm for your guest\nI've been reading Financial Times for many years and what you're saying it's was a column every week scaring the heck out of all of us with with what you're saying\n... will be closer to home I'm about four years from retirement for what thirty five years almost forty years or entity which was nationwide but some through New York\nOr pension was over from the late nineties it took a horrendous\n... the tech stocks and then two thousand they almost obliterated yeah we have a meeting with thousands of is about to retire right all high tech guys and gals the whole thing\nWe have a meeting in about three weeks that are into the camera and I don't trust in the body on Wall street I think there should be a ... year teen set up there if you will again and I'm pregnant rose bushes should come down from heaven and come back but the thing is what we ask our financial people who are running our\nPension fund with their fancy suits what are they doing to dissipate this problem and I'll take your answer off the air\nYeah you know real quick there there's two problems not only the stock market starts collapsing everybody's been driven end of the stock market because quantitative easing in monetary policy's push down long term rates that you can get on safer investments light treasury bonds and corporate bonds and things like that which pension plan should be more and but\nBut you can't get your seven to eight percent returns they used to get with a conservative combination of stocks and bonds so everybody's gone more stocks and then stock start collapsing\nThan they are in trouble the truth is as much as it's counter intuitive pension plan today the best thing you can do what we're telling people right now this this break up and ... is going to make bonds\nA corporate bonds and treasury bonds long term more attractive if that thirty year treasury bond goes up to four point three percent we're telling our subscribers this is likely to happen in the next several months for the next year at the most\nYou're going to want to lock those and not only to get a four point three percent return on his way better than almost any stock the evidence but those bonds will appreciate\nWhen stocks collapse and the economy slows down in interest rates go down bonds like falling interest rate so right now is not the time to buy these bonds but there's going to be a huge opportunity for investors\nAnd pension funds to lock in quality bonds it's only the quality bonds that did well in the great depression AAA corporate\nTen and thirty year treasury bonds lock in those things for appreciation and for higher yields and don't be in stocks the worst place to be for a pension plan is to do with everybody that run into stocks and collapse and you also write about blue states subsidizing read\nThat's why I think this time around it's going to be the blue states that succeed against red policies that they don't agree with but most of all they're like okay see what happens to your red economy when New York and California or when the northeast and the west coast succeed from the union it it would it would be a problem\nLet's go to Tom ... California he Tom go ahead\nHey George thank you for taking my call says or Harry your research is really appreciated um [noise] I mean you know you brought up earlier that a corollary to depressions and major recessions\nIs warm and\nYou could argue that the world today is in\nA third world war that's a proxy war you know in places like Syria Yemen the south China Sea et cetera and one global corporations cannot\nCompromise their differences in the global boardrooms there was a shooting war just like World War one world war two Korea\nVietnam and on and on so don't you think I mean a limited nuclear exchange could turn the United states into a third world country in a day or two you know with a lot\n[noise] yeah I think that's much more likely between emerging countries like India and Pakistan I'm there but but what we're saying and zero hour we we trade global trade back to the Eighteen hundreds and there was a big surge\nIn World War one people don't realize globalization global trade collapse sixty percent\nBetween World War one and World War two and with the great depression in the middle with a big trade war with rising tariffs just like we're seeing now everything's happening\nLike happened that this works ... it's it everybody does the selfish thing as a country but it works against the whole everybody loses or at least most countries loose and and that's what's happening now this trade war with China whether it ends up a shooting war or limited like you say in the south China Sea they can definitely be stopped there there's no question\nThere's problems they're Middle East I don't see a major war between like say the United states or Europe and Russia there could be limited because\nNobody's big enough to challenge just the one advantage we have is there's there is no counter bailing power that could really take us on one on one somebody hit us they would be dead long before we were so I think that\nKind of a good thing or in in the early Nineteen hundreds Mitt Nineteen hundred no there were major countervailing power that's how you could have World War two but we're gonna definitely have\nA political huge political views this trade war we said it's zero hour before this became of it this is gonna last two to three decades exactly what Jack Ma just said and\nThere there could be some physical or but they're certainly\nGoing to be huge a political and trade wars and things\nLike when I hear each day with us we're coming back for final phone calls with you in just a moment on coast to coast they\nGet Daily Show up the right to your inbox for free with the coast noon newsletter sign up today at ... am dot com [noise]\nHi I'm Tom Cox owner of blind stir dot com or as a family owned and operated business I started over eight years ago when my wife and I moved into a new home and needed custom blind we did what many homeowners do prices from quote unquote professionals\nAnd we couldn't believe the high prices not long afterwards I decided to take a chance and with no experience in industry I quit my job in sales for a fortune five hundred company and I started a business selling custom lines on the Internet in two thousand ten\nLines ... dot com was born I not only guarantee you love our blind eye on for a fit or free guarantee meaning if you're blondes don't fit for any reason oh remake them free of charge you only pay shipping\nAnd now ... has made it even easier checkout lines there is no tool cellular shades that first and only shades installed without screws or tools cars because listeners take up to fifty percent off any harder just use the code coast that check out that's ... dot com lines T.

final colds here Harry thank you again for the amazing information you always give us\nYup love the rich people George ... people need to hear this\nJason in Portland, Oregon welcome to the program Jason go ahead\nYeah Harry I Want to ask you about a particular sector of the market it's a new secular it has to do with the ... and I happened to it in mid July just before the huge and in the ... the growth with the average company\nWhich apple it'd be pretty good timing and I took a portfolio and actually doubled in value\nFrom about fifty thousand two hundred thousand portfolio but my question is what you hum with this kind of be bought for a little bit particularly and feel the uh election this November because there are several states that are looking you know that have it on the ballot\nAnd if they legalize usually when that happens there's a kind of an upswing or would you pull out of that now because of this the danger of ah what you're talking about taking place\nOr you know yeah that's a good question because I mean first of all this is a long term trend and even block chanting crypto currency is our but all of these industries above all these these are hot sector like this will get hit strongly\nWhen we have a downturn because first of all everything gets hit but the the the strongest sectors get hit the most because they bubble up the most and people don't understand that same with high in real estate is the best places are going to crash the most in history has shown that so\nYou do have I mean I I Would say in this case you may want to hold on just for the lecture see it as a pop but yes I Do think center in such a hot sector take your games see what happens the next few years\nEspecially the next year is going to be critical and then yeah things crash that is a good sector to get back into this\nLong term social political Trent it's going to go in that direction\nAlthough there may be some backlash in the downturn just because people get a little more conservative for a while but but you are in a good soccer but yes I I don't want to be an actor when when things crash and and and that's what a lot of people and there's a lot of people say well this sector will do All right because\nI went and the great depression entire thirties and look for one any major sector toilet paper\nUm utilities movies you know boos you know things that people would maybe use more than a downturn\nAnd and because of that collapse and valuations and that fear factor everything went down I couldn't find anything any major stock sector that made money in the Nineteen thirties only the high quality bonds that so yeah take your games\nYeah again in your case I might just see these elections pop and then then go the other way or do fifty fifty you know it it's up to you but there is danger there you're right about that\nPeriod when they when the bottom falls out hunting you know what you want more how do you know when the ... back in\nWhat will again I mean we have clear we look at past questions I mean everything's different this is not like you know the eighty two thousand eight to nine cracked and it's not like the seventies corrections stock corrections back then were fifty percent\nThat's more typical this is more like these great resets in a de leveraging of a bubble debt and financial assets which of course stock is are the leading ones when that happens Seventy percent is kind of the minimum you look for in up to eighty and in in the Nineteen twenty nine crashed\nEighty nine percent for the Dow eighty nine percent so I'm looking for levels like that I think my range\nIs Seventy five percent minimum up to eighty five percent that's when you start\nLooking to buy and again we have the same thing on the flip side for bonds right now is that thirty year treasury bond which is a been a three point four percent recently\nIf that gets up to over four percent between four and four point three percent that's when I start by even though that's the best thing in the downturn it's too early to buy that right now if you're going to park you might just be unsafe short term\nBonds and CDs and T bills and stuff to preserve your money\nNext step is moving to the long term quality bonds and then\nIn ... and these sectors I mean commodities while in emerging markets overseas will probably bottom first\nAnd then developed countries stocks and then real estate so there'll be a succession of buying opportunities so I mean and stuff like that you're in a good market like like like like marijuana pot industry especially the medicinal side which is a slam dunk winter long term [noise]\nWait for the car you may get to buy into that a little earlier\nThan something like you know home builders\nNext on that one has to do good to talk of the first time caller for cello Alan\nHey George a lot of the show Sacramento correct me if I'm wrong here but red states are Republican yup\nOkay ... Democrats were Democrats are making then did you not say earner did I miss understand you've made you said the south was read during the civil war\nThey they would have been they would have been more even though you know they called Lincoln a Republican back then the Republican Party was not the same I Know my father help build the Republican Party in the south and helped get Nixon elected through southern voters and that's a whole different party he had to convince a lotta\nOut of politicians and senators that they were really Republican they were Democrats traditionally all the way back to the civil war so the Republican democratic label actually was the opposite back then no you're right I mean read is Republican\nBlue is Democrat in the present time frame and then the Republicans in charge now if you do see a major downturn I Am just have to tell you from history it is going to favor\nThe Democratic party just like it did in the thirties where you had Republicans who were coming into that when things crash they go to the people that are going to hand out money to the people that you know the ... they'd go to the Democrats\nIn a downturn in a book in a bull market and the rich are getting richer and a lot of innovation that favors the Republicans we are\nOur long term research shows we are going to switch from Republican area here to democratic one for a number of decades and that's just something you know the blue people are gonna like that the rich people won't but all I Do is report the facts I'm I'm not\nPart is and in my work Republicans are always going to be here Democrats it's a play of opposites there's\nJust as important as men and women and booms and busts and inflation and deflation and every other player of opposite\nAnd it goes back and forth the same thing the west has dominated the world uh since since uh the industrial revolution well guess who's going to dominate in the coming decades and even century it's going to be the east and that's another trend we can clearly show through cycles so so what we do\nIs just show people here's the trends this sector that sector inflation deflation\nThis country that country blue ... I mean we can do all this stuff the long term it's surprisingly predictable\nAnd that's where Congress get it wrong economists think the short term predictable I'm guessing when I tell you I think this thing's gonna top no or so many months from now I'm making an educated guess that may make me sixty Seventy percent right but never hundred when I told told people Twenty years ago baby boomers are going to peak in two thousand seven\nIn the economy was going to slow down in his ears that was not a gas that science of when people predict money just as accurate it wasn't life insurance actuaries will tell people when they die collectively\nThat's something we'll go to Gordon them Lakeland, Florida in the wild card line in born in by the way next next week we're doing a show on student loans\nOh oh wow what a coincidence now any yeah George and hearing thanks for taking my call traditional I'm reading your intro now first off I'm rolling conservative if you put in if you ask you a little\nWho's this Gordon over in Lakeland, Florida that last for three decision on the shadow of a thing I I did better than Jeb Bush it'll find the it'll tell you my last name I'm not going to tell them to you I'm pro gun a pro gun rights fiscally conservative\nAnd now a page from the diary of flow scheme diary\nBrush off again I don't get it is there something wrong with the way I waive although although rent that little hounding me I'm friendly I get everyone peace of mind when they protect their homes their progress jumping for joy when I Walk by\nSaving average Seventy percent on car insurance when you bundle home an auto through progressive me\nNo attempt progressive casualty insurance company and affiliates discounts not available in all states are situated\nFrom the justice ... studios infancy am north Las Vegas ...

folks is going to be an amazing ride and then we'll take calls next are with him\nOn the coast to coast that you simply ticket Adam of nitrogen and bonded with the Adam box a gym and you have greeted

or go to Norman\nNutri ... heart and healthy blood pressure levels\nUm for example someone phones you and you're thinking about that first and then you say oh you must be ... I was just thinking about\nYou right well that's very common um and I think everyone has the ability if they're interested to nurture their intuition or their ESP or the ... cents a lot of people aren't interested in it as I said when I first had these experiences myself I just kind of brush them off I didn't think too much of them\nWas really only after I got sick that I started to think that maybe there was more to it than meets the eye\nWith with the psyche grown out there\nIn the ability to tap into it have you found that certain people are better at it than others\nYes definitely um well I think the most important thing is whether the person is interested in it and whether or not they are paying attention to it but the other thing I've noticed is that the second ... ability often runs in families [noise] um\nYeah that's true someone who say will say well my mother or my grandmother had that ability\nIt seems to come more from the female side doesn't\nRight that's right yeah I in fact I had the greatest\nShe fell asleep and she will cost and she said have rather had died he was living in another country and shortly afterwards she found out yet but he died while though yeah but I mean it does happen to men as well and I suspect that men don't talk about as much as women do\n[noise] but you know people talk about a woman's intuition so it does seem to have that connotation that it's more common than women and I think that's probably two plus the fact that women are more likely to talk about it than men are\nDo you think Dr these psychic experiences are from the brain or outside of the brain\n[noise] I Would say both I Would say that these are sort of um cooperation between what's going on on different levels are different dimensions and these experiences that protest in the brain\nSo for example if you take the example of an out of body experience which I have had myself and it was just completely spontaneous and that was quite young\nI had one eleven I've never been able to duplicate it again but it was one of the strangest\nWonderful little section I've ever had I mean there I was bouncing on the ceiling may looking at my body and bad I had stayed home from school I never miss school but I had a fever that day and I didn't go to my mother said uh George you don't go stay in bed\nAnd I took a nap and I woke up again in this time I was looking down at myself I thought it was a dream Mandy what a ... at that point it's land me back into my body\nI woke up I was jarred a I'm a loving years old I don't know what the heck happened to me now but eventually I got my way into a library you know weeks later\nShe stumbled into the um psyche grown section I guess and found a book on astral projection and sure enough I said that's what happened to me but I've not been able to do it since then at least in my awake moments\nWell in my case also with the ... it was completely spontaneous I wasn't trying to do it I didn't know anything about it um I just like you I just found myself floating on the ceiling looking down at my body and dead\nBut you know there there are ways to produce and out of body experience how there was a neurologist in Montreal Dr Robert Penn field was able to his mapping out the different areas of the brain and he if he put on a kickoff stimulation on the right temperature attacks he was able to produce and out of body experience [noise]\nThat that doesn't tell me the out of body experience originates in the bay and that tells me that the that air being will protests the out of body experience\nUm and you know the types of out of body experiences we had quite straightforward\nUm they weren't complicated but some people as you say it can be called astral projection around novel people can leave not just their their body that they can leave the room they can leave their house you know they can actually traveled to different locations\nAbsolutely now do you find that the people who tend to have these kinds of experiences are believers in the paranormal or not\n[noise] I'd say no not not ... not initially because when this happened to me I certainly wasn't a belief or I didn't even know such a thing as possible and I've just kind of learned about the paranormal as I go along and as I have these experiences\nUm another strange experience I had when I was a student um when I was Nineteen years old at and how does the second year medical student I dreamt of us ... exam the night before the exam and when I went to the exam the next day the first question on the exam is the same as the first question in my dream\nThe answer that you knew exactly so I felt like that dream helped me past my exam that I didn't tell anyone about it because it seems so unbelievable in fact if someone had told me that story I probably wouldn't have believed that\nThe name of the book is called the borders of normal with the subtitle a clinical psychiatrist you by the way these stigmatized says paranormal phenomena tell me about the book\nWell one of the reasons I wrote this but his you know as I say in the subtitle I'm trying to de stigmatize paranormal phenomena\nBecause what I found and this is my own experiences well when people have these experiences they tend not to talk about them because they think people are gonna think they're weird or their strange for there's something wrong with him or they're losing their mind is something like that\nBut I'm trying to say that a lot of people have these experiences it's quite normal to have these experiences I mentioned that the word parent or a month for example the ... power I mean beside\nSo we have paralegals where it can be fed lawyers have paramedics Paralympics and so on the parent normal means deciding on what it does mean have normal\nAnd there is still to this day a lot of stigma attached to talking about these phenomena and I find when I give the leading or if I give a talk somewhere people come up to me afterwards and share with me things that have happened to them which they've never told anyone\nSo I'm trying to make it more acceptable for people to talk about these things\nAnd that was really what motivated me to read stuff\nDid you ever come across research from a psychiatrist who has died named Dr shift ...\nNo I'm not familiar with him or her oh her in a it was my aunt\nAnd she she went to a Oxford University and she got her degree in psychiatry yeah and specialized in all kinds of things and then decided she was giving all that up to study telepathy\nAnd when that's all she did she wrote a couple books was called breakthrough the creativity or but she was convinced\nTotally convinced that the ... the was the real deal and and again the psychiatrist seen that in so you're the only only other psychiatrists I Know that has really jumped into this\n[noise] I don't know I'd like to look for that ... that sounds very interesting on\nBreak through to creativity I'm\nDefinitely going to look for it but you know they're being on books written by physicians about near death experiences for example even Alexander those who have and yeah and his nearest surgeon\nAnd marry the Neal she loved to have it in fact she's in our therapeutic surgeon and of course Oliver Sacks he's in ... he wrote a book called hallucinations so physicians have written about these things that I haven't found another ... who's written about paranormal\nYeah you're going to enjoy that so I mean she she just do the devoted her entire career to that uh she uh she passed away in a very bizarre way she was in the bath tub in a radio\nFilled in their own oh I Hope to God I wasn't listening to my show her no you that's terrible it was just ... how did you get\nSo interested in philosophy\nShe just always was and there were so many things that had happened to her and she just decided to do something to this and she's going to study it and she she went into it in a big way\nWell that's good but I Know there's been some studies done on telepathy at my monitor these medical center in New York where they were studying deemed telepathy the ability to transmit information to people\nAnd in that study they had Sanders and receivers\nAnd BBC rates were in a sleep lab and they were hooked up to the G ... um the AG could measure what we call Graham sleep rapid eye movement and then once the ... dream state the Centers for giving random images\nAnd they were told to concentrate on the images and try to send them to be the faith and they found that people were more susceptible to to let the when they're asleep\nAnd it's also true that people are more susceptible to like to see when they're under hypnosis so there are ways to augment leprosy but in my case and in most people's cases it just happened spontaneously\nDo you have a lot of patients that have these abilities\n[noise] no I wouldn't say so\nAll right stay with us Dr we're going to take a quick break we'll be back with the ... more Dr ... is with us his book the borders of normal [noise]\nGo students ... the new version of the coast to coast\nAm is now available for iPhones and know Android for not only listen live on demand anywhere anytime\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back with Dr many marriages were talking about his works\nNormal a clinical psychiatrist de stigmatize use per normal phenomenon many let's talk a little bit about the deathbed visions and your thoughts about that do you believe they're extremely common don't you\n[noise] that's right a lot of studies have shown that it's it's very common for someone who is dying to see a deceased friend or relative\nI'm actually happened with my dad when he was in the hospital he saw his late sister he mentioned oh there's so until you mentioned her name she was out in the hall and there was one study that was done in a hospice\nWith dying patients and they found\nA lot of these patients I'm said someone who is coming to take them and they called they didn't call them visions they called them visitors and as they got closer to death these visitors became more frequent and these visitors were these visions weren't disturbing at all they were very comforting\n[noise]\nSo yeah I think those those deathbed visions are very common now one interesting thing about death bed visions is that sometimes there are shared by people at the bedside there was one case of a woman in India who is dying and\nShe says someone a deceased relative who came to take her to the other side and every three sisters who are at the bedside also saw the same person\nHe's not the not so unusual isn't it it's\nIt's unusual but there's been several cases like that three of in some cases where the medical personnel at the bedside saw the same vision that the dying patients saw\nAnd that's interesting because\nYou know people who have deathbed visions the skeptics would say well that's because they're on medication or because they're confused or because they have a shortage of oxygen if the lack of oxygen to the brain they tried to give some kind of physical explanation for it\nBut it's visions are shared than those explanations wouldn't be valid because the people at the bedside wouldn't have a shortage of oxygen to their brains\nAnd they weren't on medication so\nUm it's hard to know how to explain that and there again the people who have these visions aren't necessarily believers in the afterlife but these experiences are quite common\nWednesday when Steve Jobs from apple computer died many you know he was quoted as saying\nOh wow oh wow right now what\nDo you think he's he was making reference to\n[noise] well I Know some people who are dying tell their relatives they see a beautiful landscape a beautiful vision you know\nI'm a bright white light you know a spiritual beings you know I'm a feeling of unconditional love you know these are some of the things that I imagine that Steve Jobs was experiencing\nYeah that could be that would be no skeptics of course say what the you mentioned that you\nKnow it's the body itself is doing all these weird things near the moment the death how can we argue against that\nWell there was one study of um cardiac patients who had been assassinated after cardiac arrest\nAnd this study was done by a cardiologist and he said of of the the patients who who died and where we start to pay to Eighteen percent of them had a new report it in the near death experience\nBut it's that experience is due to lack of oxygen to the brain than they would have all had it because they all had a lack of oxygen the brain not just as a small percentage so you know that's one thing but then the other thing is that um these experiences are reported around the world not just in the U. S.\nUse that show that these experiences are in many different countries and they'd be being reported throughout time and one study looked at patients who are on medication\nVersus patients who weren't on medication and the patients who weren't talking medication who weren't confused and he didn't have a shortage of auction to the brain had the same experiences and were able to report them just as often as the other patients so [noise] um people are skeptical I think for a good reason and I think it's good to be skeptical\nBut it's also good to keep an open mind\nWell that's that's true in ... you you've talked about under deathbed the decisions that they sometimes see a little bit more than just a family member they see other kinds of visitors as well explain that well\nThe other visitors aside from family members they could be someone that they were very close to or sometimes they report angels coming to the others I'm coming to take them to the other side\nUm especially with children and there was a pediatrician males and Mars who worked his dying children and he said the dying children didn't report\nDeceased relatives because their parents and their relatives and friends were all still living but they reported seeing angels that we're having to take them to the other side I had an experience at my father's funeral where I thought to angel is one of the other side of the costs and\nDid anybody else you\nKnow so I could say I know they were a product of my own brain no one else saw them but in my own mind I saw those angels\nAnd they were just as clear as day standing right in front of me and I had the idea that thought came into my mind that they were ... minutes during angels and they had the idea that they were minister and my father to help them make the transition it's the next\nLevel of the next world and there is the most beautiful creatures and I didn't know what to make that but that's really when I decided I Need to start telling people about what's going on because that\nWas too much for me to keep to myself\nDo they see you\nI don't think so\nOkay I don't think there were there for me I think there were there for my father right so they didn't acknowledge you know you know you saw them\n... that's right now the other thing is when you say in terms of deathbed visions [noise] you know um if they were produced by certain chemicals\nThen live with the um visitors only ... the people who were seized why wouldn't they be other people as well\nThe other thing is sometimes these visions of these people they are the person who is dying doesn't know there may be a a brother or sister who had died is the case where there was a car crash and ... all one rather died and the other brother was near death\nSo the the brother that was near death had a vision of his dad brother but he hasn't been told that his brother had died in the same accident he didn't know that there was the end\nAnd the other cases like that to where the the deathbed visitors the person who is dying didn't know that that person was actually dead but because the family wanted to spare\nThan the knowledge pre cognitive dreams you lose your thoughts on what they are\nWell there again I've had the cognitive beams I mentioned one above the memory powerful above yeah exactly they're very powerful and the question is how do we know of a dream is a pre cognitive team or if it's an anxiety dream\nBecause often and you know when people are sleeping during the dreams they'd try to protests things that happened during the day or things that they're worried about\nSo you know for example\nAbraham Lincoln two weeks before he was assassinated he he had a dream that he was murdered\nNow we could say that that was a peak cognitive dream that we could also say that could have been an anxiety dream maybe he was worried that someone was going to kill him\n[noise] maybe I think you also had a dream where he was in the White House and he walked up to you so you're ... by ... and it was him in the ...\nI heard that too yeah [noise] so that could have been in the crowd and intervene but another famous person who reported a pre carved into view of Charles Dickens really hear that\nYeah 'cause when he would put out a new book you travel around the small towns and villages and he'd give readings and so on so one night before he was reading into a new town where he'd never been before he had a dream that\nIn a group of people came up to him after his reading and a young woman in red shah introduced himself to her with four words she said I Am missed Napier so when he woke up he thought that was very strange she didn't know anyone by that name but he remarked that the dream was very vivid\nAnd free cognitive beams tend to be very vivid\nI'm often when we wake up in the morning or dream start to fade but the cognitive dreams stay with us and we remember every detail so the next day he went to give his reading and sure enough after the meeting a group of people came up to him and there was a young woman wearing a red Shaw and she was introduced to him as ... Napier\nSo so this stream was a pretty cognitive dream and he didn't know what to think of it or\nOr how to explain it but he he reported he had that the cognitive dream so um it's some people for example Larry ... is a person has written about\nYour condition century cognitive beans and he's written a boat when should we pay attention to a dream how do we know if it's a peacock into beam or not and he said we should pay attention to dreams first of all the agreements week current\nOr if it's especially vivid or if it involves death I heard of a case recently where um this woman told her husband ... that she dreamt that she and her children died in a terrorist attack and this is a number of\nThe all new radio dot com app is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone\nOr anywhere [noise]\n[noise] hey Sean Spicer and every mid term election since the civil war the president's party is locked in an average of thirty two seats in the house of representatives and two in the Senate We're in for what will be a wild political season and there's going to be plenty to discuss and debate and dissect\nShe'll be sure to download my new podcast everything's gonna be alright beginning in October ... and I was an hour long weekly political tide gas covering the very\nLatest news across the country and will provide listeners with unique inside you can't get anywhere else everything's going to be alright subscribe and download today on radio dot com and I\nI'm\nFrom the justice of heart ... studios K intend ti a up north Las Vegas ...

the environment\nAs opposed to let's say a one on one and and do you know the work of Dr Stan is law for growth he does uh spiritually emergence or all the states he's a psychiatrist by the way\nYes definitely I'm familiar with Dr growth in terms of psychic fairs I don't go to a psychic votes but I have attended um international conferences on science and spirituality and I do find that when I'm with like minded individuals are these types of experiences are more common\nYeah that that I could see that happening\nWell for one thing you feel more accepted and you feel more able to talk about what's going on you know you feel more comfortable right right and you know you don't feel like you're going to get ridiculed down and I think it's important to water and therefore you're not so defensive\nThat's true and again I'm fascinated with the possibilities of being able to you know like pre she'll perform exercises ... there's something demonic ... that have you come across anything like that in your studies\nDemonic possession anything like that no I haven't but you know there was a psychiatrist Scott pet I don't know if you're familiar with him you love this you're called the road less traveled okay and he wrote about a lot of paranormal experiences\nBut he also got into reading about evil his concept of evil and he did write about possession and demonic possession so I haven't come across that personally but I Am familiar with it\nLet's go to divine Texas first time\nIn a boat possession and demonic possession so I haven't come across that personally but I Am familiar with it\nLet's go to divine Texas first time caller Sherlock with those good morning sure all\nGood morning I'm so glad to be on your show I Am one into 'em hey thank you for your guest here I um had a really\nStrong very powerful encounter before Princess Diana had passed away and um I Dreamed about her I visit her\nFor like two weeks every night and my sleep and she gave me the whole like she just like\nTowards the end I was driving in their car and having lunch and she and we just talk and we just communicated\nIt at all from\nWe just hit it off and\nWhen the night that she died I was sitting on the couch with bad weather we're having a storm and I was doing laundry can sleep and I just knew something was wrong and then when I saw everything happening on the TV screen it just was like so surreal it was just\nIt was bizarre time I've ever had anything like that ever happened to me um I don't know if anyone else has ever had that kind of I mean it sounds like what you're talking about two and then for my son died I had the same thing I had the\nVision of ... a dream for like two weeks and just didn't sleep an uneasy feeling and to cop coming to his dad's\nDoor so horrible and\nI didn't know what to think of it and it was just I've never had anything else like that happen [noise] um [noise] so um I I'm familiar you know I'm I've heard you know I just\nI don't know like I it only happens in close people to me when it's a they're going to die I kinda know I you know I kinda know things like\nDo you tell them\n[noise] well um no no no I Know I don't know who's going to die I just\nGet really ... somebody's going to die\nI just get um I get very I start crying crying you know I get very emotional and very sensitive and just crying and upset but not sure why many what causes\nOf fish don't want to say I'm Sorry to hear about your son and I was wondering um if you've had any post death contact with him now anyway posts they do I have not any contact with him since he died\nNow I have not and several people [noise] my daughter's in several other friend path but no I have not in that very troubling\n[noise] okay well in terms of your question uh George what causes that well I guess I Would call that a pre cognitive dream or premonition [noise] you know and I think it's related to the well on a theoretical level you could say on one level we're all\nConnected\nAnd somehow we're able to communicate with each other in a way that we're not really aware of you know I'm I think that especially with someone very close like a family member especially you know a child or sibling or parent or a spouse\nIf you want to communicate with the deceased loved one is it easier to be a little more aggressive to try to communicate with them or do you laid back and let them try to come to you\nI Would say the ladder I Would let them come to you know because they may not be ready\nI Would say it's the latter I Would let them come to you know because they may not have any\nDo you have to give them any signs that you're already\nWell you have to I think you have to say that you're open to the experience and that you would love to hear from them and then the ball is in their court\nWhat's going to burn junior Keats with us welcome to the program Keith\nHi George how are you hearing their good good can you hear me okay pretty good okay great\nUm I wanted to mention a couple of things one last night with your guest that called in but uh too late to get on and it there's some commonality and some of the topics tonight\nAbout um the paranormal and\nAh you know something I consider to be quite a link between paranormal and be a Judeo Christian teachings of the Bible and the missing link couldn't be\nA the content of a book called eternal man and\nAnybody can Google bat or search it on YouTube or Amazon you can find different lectures some things about that and over the years times this book written by a BYU religion of ... how often the professor and over the years I'm just listening\nTo coast to coast it's just been quite remarkable that\nThere there is so much of the paranormal or that ... that can be clarified and expanded upon perhaps to give some understand the process of of the eternal nature and our spiritual nature as well and\nUm to switch to another topic really quick I'm\nA ... years ago I had a dream and it could've been induced by a listener on the coast to coast a lot about you ever got experience to friends who passed away only about I think Thirteen Days apart from each other and then about twenty five days after the second one\nI had a dream it was very vivid now this dream as for about\nThirteen Years ago I think and uh I can still remember it today\nUm I don't remember what happened before the than some of the dream and I don't remember what happened after the events of the jury in my dream but the but it was a very vivid and I want you to hold that\nThought and and retain that fought in your consideration about the possibility of a the certainty of Dr Christine Blasey Ford\nAbout the events that she said happened to her but yet all the people that she mentioned not a single one of them knew anything about that and ah the dream that I had was that um that was my my brother's apartment\nWhere the second round have little he passed away playing basketball one night with my brother and and um he at the end of\n'em this time the dream he says to\nMy brother to me I'll see you later and he looks at me and he says and I'll see you and Thirteen months and I knew he was dead and him\nAs a a pretty young lady that was wearing like\nQuote a charcoal grey quote I'm cutting coke or standing next to him I didn't know who that was had seen her before\nAnd this is in in a dream yes it was all a dream\nNext to him I didn't know who that was a cheer before and this is in a in a dream dream and and I thought you know and and every you know the people that I had a dream or\nLike when I was in the apartment was laid out I can tell you rack up where when everything about it\nAnd um and so uh and I and I actually did I Do take action I got life insurance and I figured there was a fifty fifty chance on that can happen\nAnd as the Thirteen months approached it was a well it didn't happen you know he didn't play in mind when they didn't say and fourteen months

with you were in our final segment with Dr among many meets his his book is called the borders of normal and many when you were putting in the book together was there are some part of it that just overwhelmed you that you did not expect that you came across when you were researching it and put it together\nLike that most interesting thing with a deathbed vision you know because I left acting that I didn't realize how common that was [noise] you know we've we've certainly heard a lot of a near death experience and vision and out of body ... associated with near death experience\nBut I wasn't really ... with a deathbed vision or the vision of deceased loved ones that are also very I'm In\nThe death bed divisions do you think it's the body's way of making death a little more comfortable for people or is it something that is strictly outside of the physical brain\nI think it's both I think it's a combination because I like to look at it and the point of view of the body plus the mind cut the emotional life plastic spiritual life so I think that for different components each one is important\nWhat has been for you the most dramatic case you've come across\n... that's a good question because there's so many of them I mean ... ... cases of example people who've had the cognitive dreams that have helped him win lottery\nWow you know I I don't get those kind of dreams\nSample people who've had the cognitive dreams that have helped him win lotteries\nWow you know I'm I don't do those kind of dreams\nNo me neither but that's that's been verified [noise] you know I wanted to say one comment about your previous caller\nSure when he was talking about the connection between paranormal experience and the Judeo Christian tradition\nMm mhm [noise]\nIf you look at the Bible there's certainly lots of biblical profits like Daniel and as the ... or if example Joseph you know who had the cognitive dreams are prophetic beams you might say and even in the history of the church people like St Francis if a CC or Joan of arc they heard voices\nYou know when when John was Thirteen Years old she said she saw lining white light and you heard of voice which he identified as the arcade games on my call coming from her father's garden\nSo these experiences have been documented by many people throughout the Bible and throughout the history of the church so I think there is a connection\nYeah they're most definitely is just remarkable how this works man it's it's you know let's call it the gods factor or whatever it might be but it's out there it's real yeah the big question is why should the were the first place what do you think\n[noise] [noise] ... the first thing that came to my mind is it's out there to make our lives more meaningful it\nGives us a different level or a different dimension to our lives and then somehow is that something to feel like what we're going through even if it's a painful experience can have some meaning it can have some value\nAbsolutely okay let's take some phone calls here for you we will be in by going to Joe in Long Island New York to Joseph go ahead\nYeah Hi Maddie I Want to ask you a little bit more about the dreams\nAre interestingly I had to dreams recently that began with a preference\nOf the day it's set of sucked told the first and I ended up at the beach I go on the water it's a little rough but

I guess he came up to a meeting of the ... when you followed your project well and there are a talk about um [noise] I'm a planet or outside of our\nOur solar system called them ... but it was part of a of a greater confederation of our planet said courts that included um that that included being is\nYou know you're going to have to refresh my memory just a little bit because I'm trying to remember

back after this\nWe tend to we sent the mariners to and which is which is very um [noise] a very interesting because I'm I'm a it wasn't very comprehensive a it's a it's a now is is that created this initial impression that\nLife couldn't exist there for example it only took three sporadic measurements for temperature up from a distance\nOf a hundred and Twenty one thousand miles out and that they were just measuring the lamb of Venus 'em and they were they were measuring I'll um electrical heat and not a and not a ... surface heat so they were measuring\nThe heat and the ionosphere electrical heat generated from a lightning storms\nOkay and then Nineteen Seventy we sent the narrow seven which actually landed on Venus tire yet\nYes that that's true and we were very concerned I'm In the higher echelons of the the US government because we had a project a secret project called white Stuart project white stark\nI'm Out of out of a Alabama\nAnd that and uh I have the reports and everything and they were monitoring our scientists and and the air force and intelligence personnel were monitoring the various Russian scientists like ... and others\nAre to what they were really finding out about Venus and so in my book my second book the\nFinal countdown rockets to Venus I tell you what's in project white Stark's report and as well as the findings are from the Russian scientists\nBut the nearest seven really even though it landed there he couldn't get any good in images due to the cloud is used\nBut the veneer some and really even though it landed there you couldn't get any good in images due to the cloud is used and all that I Believe right\nOh well it they they did get they did get some ah some good pictures and then with the later ones like the vet narrow fourteen and then some NASA scientists did a composite of the of the um\nUh the pictures and they're and they're not they're not really a a available to the public but you could you could see why one of them on the um\nUm planetary society is a a website and it actually looks like um I've seen from a I'm a ... shop and New Mexico\nOK well dominate the but uh that's right\nThat's why I'm a Jason and gave me that's why I call NASA NASA never a straight answer\n[laughter] in the new acronym for them I mean there's probably perfect\nOr anything but he tied into the government that much but it wasn't until Ninety One when we had the Magellan orbiter that we're able to get some good high definition pictures current\nUh uh yes and we we got some ah photographs that show that show cloud formation surround Venus I'm much like on the earth\nAh and um and uh uh Venus in a in a you know in a blue few looks like just\nTruly is a twin planet to the earth being this or has a you know has a hard terrestrial surface\nHide has um a it has a an atmosphere and its approximately the same um um diameter of the earth it's only two hundred and Seventeen miles last and in its diameter so it you know and and\nAnd comparative size that's the closest planet or in size\nOr to um to the earth and and its closest approach it told me twenty six million I'm I'm\n... miles away so it's right under our noses and there's a lot more to Venus than uh than people have been given given it credit\nWas one of very you lend itself and that actually in opposite of ears\nOh yes in fact there right now at Venus and uh uh in in in retrograde because it's moving a actually be behind the earth so when you look at it and chart in the sky a kind of looks like a\nA R O O looping action or over time\nRe when was the last time a NASA and needs to be easy for that matter send some type of a mission to Venus whereby we might be able to use some of the newer technology to being employed and these missions to get more accurate data\nWell in in a twenty sixteen the Japanese sent the rockets Suki pro\nAnd it took some really spectacular ah ah photographs in recent NASA solar pro pie is using ... to create a slingshot ah affect um to push it out toward the sun so it'll be\nA looping around the sun and Venus or for maybe five cycles\nSo when you talk about conspiracy what ... years\nAs for for maybe five cycles\nSo when you talk about a conspiracy but we're really talking about here is that there's information which would be actually rather spectacular information that's being kept from us by the governments of the world in relation to what's actually happening on the surface of Venus I\nGuess yes that's right and um [noise] I um I produced down\nA documents from ah up some obscure Soviet journals and or the or rockets to Venus showing that a certain portions of the surface measure to uh eighty four degrees\nA Fahrenheit and that that die magnetic properties of the gases in the nutrition atmosphere allowed for the um the presence of oxygen at the at the at the lower levels\nAnd um I'm also um the um the Soviet probes and that even their their earlier um Mariner probe uh indicated that an atmospheric pressure of only six to eight\nTimes as great as the as\nThe earth versus the Ninety three times a that that they're telling us now\nAnd what's the ... year why would this a conspiracy exist to begin with one of the freedoms\nAre well I think they're they're afraid of five or ... not only not only Venus but the the other planets I'm I'm In our solar system that thought they don't want us to know that the whole mentality of space is filled with\nAh with intelligence says and not only that but uh wife doesn't have to exist only as we\nKnow it you know they always say well life as as as we know it but we know that there are extreme of filed forms of life on a on earth that can live at volcanic vent set nine hundred degrees at the bottom of the of the ocean\nYou know which is like a equivalent to a hundred\nAtmospheres [noise] ah so um you know outer space um it's not the um uh the desolate wasteland and boy that that they would have us believe it is oh we've got a lot of cosmic\nNeighbors out there and all the contact is from Georgia dams gay\nUh Howard manager Truman bathroom Daniel Frye of they were all telling the truth and about the Venus and about a this the presence of a of a greater galactic federation out there in\nUh in our so um you know are galactic arm of the galaxy the Milky Way galaxy or we're not alone\nWill but if NASA news we're not alone why he did and the reason I'm asking is because you think that if they put the word out there than everybody else there'd be more than willing to try to financially support now in their ability to actually get out there and make contact correct\nUm ... yes I ... and ... that they may have been I'm I'm worried about this\nSocietal implications the political and socio economic implications have ... discovering or other forms of why we we know for example that I'm that I'm here on earth\nCan ... discovering other forms of why we we know for example that town that I'm here on earth when civilization Kevin encountered each other for the first time I usually wind up on\nThe west technologically develop one will will quickly crumble\nLike it'd be as tax and we're right or a
