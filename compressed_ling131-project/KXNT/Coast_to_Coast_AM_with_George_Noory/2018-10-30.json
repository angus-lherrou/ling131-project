anything\nIt said fears was cabinet anachronism anyway you know the the the retailers that are having problems right now are having problems because they're having you know their their their model is not correct not because of Amazon\n... do you think they should've adjusted that they could have prevented some of the things that have happened to them like toys R. us and all the other places\nOh yeah oh for sure you know toy cigarettes makes me crazy you know I I started um [noise] um yeah I bet if you follow toys are us on in the wall Street Journal in you know it's it's essentially gone now

a hot wheels and Barbie dolls\nYou know what the real problem is is what if what they say and they already read the wall Street Journal article just a few months ago that said that ah kids now are so enthralled with their phones the iPhones that\nThey're no longer a you know they don't want to have any consideration for hot wheels are Barbie dolls the real problem is there are fewer kids about twenty five percent pure kids under ten now than there were ten years ago you think maybe just maybe that has something to do with their ... their sales decline\nAnd that could be it\nCould makes me crazy and you know I was seriously if you have a twenty five percent decrease in the size of your market I don't care if you're if you're in General Motors or or Amazon\nOr your you know your sales are going to decline it it they're just they weren't born they don't exist\nYou know they don't but how do you look into a crystal ball can make these predictions if you're running a business\nWhat it what you do is is the what's the most important question friday business a business you know I I I was uh\n... ... what you do is is the what's the most important question for any business any business you know I I I was um\n[noise] I had an opportunity\nTo speak to the chief marketing officer is in the hospitality industry about two years ago and and everyone was there she ... a share of him was their Hilton was there and Google was their American Express was there these are all people that have to do with with the hospitality industry\nAnd I asked him I said what's the most important question you need to ask yourself right now an end of the ... you know come on marketing folks ... million dollar salaries in this room there was about twelve people in the room and sitting around and round table\nAnd they eat their answer was you know a Google said it's it's the uh understanding social media and how to advertise how the market on social media and and the American express said we have to get into their heads we have to we have to understand this new generation why a ... you know how they think how they buy\nAnd Hilton says it's it's about new products it's about making room smaller and your lobbies bigger\nYou know what the answer is the answer is is how big is your market and it's getting bigger or smaller\nThat's right it's all about demographics isn't it\nYeah it is because if your market is getting smaller I don't care how good you are Levi Strauss called me up and asked me what was going on with their market but you know it it for about Twenty years they could make their product fast enough they literally couldn't meet the demand and all of a sudden sales started trailing off is\nWas Nineteen Ninety eight and I and I said I'm\n... so your your sales are ... are are going flat and he said yeah what do we have a demographic issues as to the chief marketing officer in San Francisco Levis and and I said a Hoosier customer and he's got an Eighteen to thirty four year old man or woman Eighteen to thirty four and I said what happens at thirty four years old that they can't buy your product and he's over ... they don't fit in the product anymore\nI said you realize you're a boomer business and he said yes I said the last baby boomers born Nineteen sixty four Nineteen sixty four I said I Am thirty four years to Nineteen sixty four where you come up with and he said there was a pause and he said\nNineteen Ninety eight and I said we're in it and he said Nineteen Ninety eight\nAnd he said what does that mean is it what that means is you know your your last gas just checked out of your hotel and their their sales one from eight billion get this George eight billion to two and about three years while why because they're not paying attention to demographics\nYou know if you want to count money count money go ahead knock yourself out\nBut if you want to understand where money came from it came from people ... people and you will understand\nLizard in simple to tend to talk to that demographic you need to go after a bench ally and find out some of the things they enjoy\nAnd look at those trends you find out that you know if their kids Eighteen to twenty four years old younger people find out from them what did they do what do they like where do they go they go to movies do they not and then adjust yourself to that\nGeorge you too smart [laughter] but but you did that doesn't that sound like like logic commonsense is not so common volunteer said that you know I I Do um\nI'll speak to an audience for five hundred people and and I'll say everybody stand up and then I'll say everybody born before Nineteen sixty five sit down and I say that's the boomers everybody you see that the boomers all sat down and I'll say okay if you were born before Nineteen eighty five sit down\nAnd ... and another large groups that fell in ... and I say that's Gen x and then then you're about three people standing and I said this that's Gen Y that Gen Y or Z\nAnother large group six out of ... and I said that's Jenn ... tender about three people standing and I said this that's why the Gen Y or the millennials\nAre born ... or eighty five to two thousand for this eighty seven million of them I said you want to know about the new market you you have to hire these people and you don't have a clue because they're not here and it makes me crazy\nEl ... it's ... you got to adjust because if you don't you're not you're not going to succeed yeah what's happening with what's happening like companies like McDonald's are they on top of things they used to be marketing genius as something slipping\nI Know you're not you want to tell people I'm see McDonalds same store sales are off you know they're they're all their increases are coming from um their\nOverseas operations ... I I I I tell folks I said listen it generation y is now fourteen to thirty three years old it's eighty seven million people are just now starting to have children I said and they realize what their parents were feeding them for the last Twenty years\nAs I said you you ought to three ends up of a food it's called nutrition nutrition nutrition and what is mc Donald's famous for its not nutrition [laughter] no it's it's for French fries\nDarn listen to what they tried to say heart people have the impression that it's not nutritional food\n[noise] if exactly correct and and so that's that's their problem they they ... if you if you want to sell food now if you want to sell food\nUh it in the supermarket and if you want to sell food in a restaurant you need to sell good food you can't tell you you can't sell stuff that's going to stop people's hearts\nWhat's going on with population trends are they shifting down to\n[noise] yeah it was you know it's funny you say that uh\nIn Nineteen ... we we have a new generation is called Generation Z and Generation Z started in two thousand fight and they will they will be a but they will end around two thousand twenty four so they're not fully born yet [noise]\nBut in Nineteen eighty seven excuse me two thousand seven we had a record year in the United states we we we have four million a three hundred and sixteen thousand babies were born and that that was more than Nineteen fifty seven which was the previous record fifty one years earlier [noise]\nAh what's happened since two thousand seven is is the the population has dropped like a stone we we've gone from producing a over four million babies a year down to a just a little over three million babies a year\nAnd and so this Generation Z will be smaller yeah\nThat's a big trend can stay with us we'll talk more about trends when we come back we'll take calls with you next hour Iran coast to coast they um\nFive one seven that's S. P. A. C. E. two three five five one seven\nAM well come on you soggy forty J ax anti\n\nThere and welcome back in the ... back with us as we talk about trends the incredible trends that the I guess can not just businesses should be using things like this I Would guess anybody who's doing something marketing you name it should be aware of these things should night\nYeah absolutely it does it it is mysterious to me well why everyone doesn't think about this because it precipitate almost everything that we have in a market economy\nHow much has the smartphone change these things\n[noise] well it has to a large degree\nUm the [noise]\nYou know what what I tell people when when they asked me a question like that [noise] if people are still people when when you have a\nLarge number of people that are consumer a specific product at a small number of people are consume specific product the large number of people will consume more though I Know that sounds were imagery but the ... the smartphone has a only aged folks and their ability to consume\nSo it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint but you have to keep in mind that\nTheir ability to consume so uh it's it's a good thing from from that standpoint but you have to keep in mind that\nThe thing that drives commerce of the thing that drives you know consumption is the number of people in the market period\nNow that's [noise] that's simple isn't it\nWas ... it almost sounds ridiculous doesn't it I mean I'm ... I mean who is out there saying well okay so large groups of people consume a lot of stuff and then there's ... people consume\nSmaller amounts of stuff but if I read the wall Street Journal every day and I read the marketing section and I know that the wall Street Journal just based on what I read doesn't understand that\nBecause they the uh let me give you an example of it you know SUVs actually these were were bought by baby boomers\nAre Twenty years ago in in vast quantities\nAnd then the the um [noise] um the automobile companies had to figure out how to sell the same number of SUVs to a generation X. as they did to the baby boomers and they couldn't do it so they they kept on firing their marketing departments that have kept on firing their\nTheir chief marketing officers because they couldn't come up with the secret to selling as many SUVs to this other group but nobody bothered to count them and this other group of generation and\nNow you find that make it easy for small\nPoint my my twenty four year old granddaughter Ken was talking to a couple of days ago and she said pop on you know kids are age she calls herself for Cuban she's young woman now we're not getting married like you folks used to and that's another trend can isn't it\nYeah and in you know it it's funny 'cause I'm trying to figure that one out because you know half of the kids that are born today or the babies that are born in it and that's all about you know demographics\nAre born uh outside of wedlock they're born outside of a of a marriage [noise] um the marriages seemed to come after the kids are born as opposed to for before a and there are certain cultures like the African American culture or where Seventy five percent of the kids are bought outside of the the uh\nA marriage it it's just it's a different time George\nNow if you could understand that whether it's a you know we're talking a lot about business but if you can understand that how much can you affect change\n[noise] well you know that that's another good question I'm not so sure that you can I I think you mean in terms of changing what the culture is doing\nI think the culture is going to do with the culture is going to do in right now we have the largest generation and history of our nation is currently fourteen to thirty three years old eighty seven ... million generation why millennials and I think they're going to do what they're going to do just like the uh uh you know you go back to forty years\nAnd ... you look at the you know what happened in the sixties and early seventies with the hippie culture they did what they did they just simply did what they did but then what happened they grew up in a you know I I actually spoke to my audience what happened to the to a sex drugs and rock and roll what happened to the ... the boomer hippies\nLive became Republicans [laughter]\nIn all cases\n[laughter] no not at all cases but you know if if you if you look at [noise] that this this is ... let me back up a second because this is something that that people need to understand [noise] [noise] ah [noise] between the ages right now I'm thirty four in fifty three we have a diminutive puppy populace\n[noise] [noise] ah [noise]\nBetween the ages right now I'm thirty four in fifty three we have a diminutive puppy it population of of indigenous people that were born here there were there were only about sixty nine million people born between sixty five an eighty four\nAs opposed to the boomers that were that were roughly eighty million border between forty five and sixty four\nWhat does that mean that means that that that particular population could not a ... support the labor needs that we had in our country and it sucked in immigrants like like a a a vacuum\nThat particular generation right now is the generation that is make making people think that we're a nation of haves and have nots when when what we are as a nation that has a small indigenous population\nOf superimposed over where the heavy lift or should be rich where's it was you know our our strength should be in our population it's actually smaller\nSo the net result is a you know ... ... instead of having a you know ... ... and they should have haves and have nots with with a cushion in between of generation X we don't because they were never born\nWe're losing a cushion\nYeah well what we did and as you so you you have people saying that the the United States is is broken because we have the have nots but middle age\nAnd and I'm In a middle income uh\nArt occupy exactly the same space so if you're middle ages small and then your middle income is small as well but it's a demographic issue it was just simply a question of of how many babies were born for that particular period\nCan't let me ask you this to be a ... let's use Facebook as an example you know they they've got the billions of people on line or they've got huge amounts of advertising dollars because of what they do socially\nBut I think they're starting to lose that I think they're starting to lose becoming a change there were I think advertisers you begin to say I'm not sure we're getting bang for a dollar a year or you were converting these into sales\nBecause the market may not be what we really want what's happening with that\n[noise] a Facebook is kind of strange [noise] entity if you will and I tell folks listen it if you're if you're not paying for it you are not the customer you're the product\nUm as far as I'm concerned and I and I've got a Twenty one years experience in the marketing industry\nThe Internet are um advertising is a bottomless pit you have no idea what your pie none and there's no way to a reference any kind of success except return on investment so you you spend money on the Internet\nAnd and you just cross your fingers and hope that your sales go up your sales go up you you don't know if it's if it's a relative to how much money you spend on the Internet but uh what what's happening with a ... a enterprise there is is not good it really isn't\nI mean it's huge but there's a trend here and to me the trend is very negative so that it\nIs involved in what's negative about it is is uh I I think he's totally disingenuous I I don't trust 'em a Facebook at all I I really don't I don't think I I think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed and\nThen the ... and ...\nI think you have to understand George that everything that anybody writes on on Facebook can be analyzed and then the ... and and that analysis put people into categories and those categories uh our sellable and and what a sucker Berg does with that information is sell it to anybody who will pay

back as we talk about trends and demographics a great information we'll talk a little bit about what ... what's happening to China and don't forget India and don't forget you when we come back\nAnd talk a lot about simply say ... security a lot on the program it's a great security system great protection very easy to use and we'd know these folks for a long time and since there was just a few of them working together the company just has grown and grown and grown and the founder started the company because he wanted to keep his friends\nAnd help them who were burglar priced and now they're

...\nNot areas you know this dirty laundry in public I just wish it wouldn't happen\nWell but ... let me ask you this devil's advocate in by the way I've commented on who's tweeting too because I I think he needs to be a little more presidential he's got some great ideas I'm not a a lot of great ideas I don't agree with everything he says\nBut I'd rather be a little more presidential a little more dignified when in back off the tweeting and stuff like that but\nIf you let them spot what they did without defending themselves then what happens to him\n[noise] I I think that was in the punishment would be [laughter] what they've said and and um [noise]\nI I don't know I I think what he has done his dignify\nAt the argument and I and I don't think there is one\nI really don't\nKnow I mean somebody got paid a lot of money to to do what they did and she got it and I mean there was a reason for that who led to it who pushed it who knows but\nYou know get a you know on one hand you got to defend yourself on the other how much do you hire yourself in it and then just move on and say you know folks I already said it I'm done with it and ended up like that\nIt exactly George\nC ... and I respect the the um the criticism I really do of of ... my comment because\nC ... and I I respect the the um the criticism I really do a ... of ... my comment because when I stray outside of demography\nMy position on the ... and my ability to forecast what's next based on demography is based on a ... a very macro view a very thirty thousand foot view\nWhen you know you you asked me a question about the president I'm I made the comment about the president but that was really subjectivity on my part that I mean that's what I feel\nRight now our unit yeah kind of ... what's what's going to happen\nGoing forward ... ... is it right now we have a polarized country in the country is polarized\nJust like it was in the sixties early seventies because we have a huge population of young people in a huge population of old people and in between there is a small population that does not offer\nThe the a position of of either of those too so uh\nWell what I like about dean is remarks though is she's she said how she felt without screaming without putting you down for your views and that's what it's all about that's the way it should be\nExactly yeah so so might make a comment today and it would be thank you for your position and said she forgot yelling at me [laughter]\nThat's good zero in Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead I\nCan to question and so it it talked about the wall Street Journal having more information than a ... and one issue than ... people have it you know them and how the system that's amazing explosion basically it's a lot of people pick and choose\nA their information or even at a a professional level what what's the average size in the sense that if you look at Japan\nPeople used to like Twenty years ago the people just work twenty four seven almost and it just hasn't worked out it and then to federal level in Japan for people with that high octane\nA drive to a stay at the office till midnight or whatever [noise]\nAh so maybe they're lacking creative conscious something my second question will be about Amazon up\nI Know they get criticized for putting out small for prior to send I can understand that but at the same time the stuff you can find on there that you can find locally even a even a New York for example I got I got this great gloves the shoveling my neighbors snow\nAnd that's the main thing I mean but I couldn't find them locally I got 'em on Amazon from like Minnesota\nI go for the first question again\n[laughter] ... inside just dwelling on Long Island hey I'm from Long Island too but what was the first question\nGo ahead of you know the nonsense again Joe ...\nYou know now that that's really example explosion at video ... you know like half of everything people get on a smartphone I think of as video based\nJust how should people if they're trying to move ahead or in the world just pick and choose how they consume information\nWhat to emphasize a because it doesn't necessarily work out to put this grand deference of something whether it's just so so much information like you like a total of ... on the ... what good does it do the ... it's just too overwhelming\n... where's your attorney who's a question of information that we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if um\nBut where's your mentor me here's your question of information\nThat we get as it is overwhelming so what do you do with it you know if if I'm a ... a lot of the the the Gen Y kids the millennials are actually tuning it out you can ask them simple questions about you know what's going on in the world and they can't answer is\nBut ... fatty or sit for this which you have to do is you have to compare several sources that's and that's what I Do when I Do research and when I Do presentations I really don't\nI come to any kind of conclusions unless I've compared a variety of sources and that's what helps me with information and in terms of Amazon I think Amazon is just you know ... what we did when we open the Internet we opened up the world we we just that was our view\nTo the innards of the world and I think what's what's going down with Amazon is just something that's naturally transpiring and I think if you're just going to get nothing but bigger you're going to see commerce is going to change everything about commerce is going to change\nWe've done a company that shift radios they make radios and their make darn good radio see Korean company and I I used to get my radios from them long before I started doing this show\nAnd it was simple you you go on line you order what you want it's delivered to your house in some cases it's free shipping based on the deal that they've got at any given time\nI mean you don't have to park your car you don't have to spend money on gasoline you don't have to find a crowd it's a it's it's amazing it's amazing I mean\nIt's infinitely easier you know when when you look at the boomers what how do you do business with a boomer you save them some time you make their life easy and you don't rip them off this was perfect and so Amazon is is is going to do nothing but a grow\nA you know and that online retail ... will exceed the tempers that where it is now is probably going to twenty percent thirty percent\nI think so too they hurt bricks and mortar but I mean the the the goods are still being manufactured\nUm the Amazon employees zillion people um some of which complain about their job they're um or conditions and things like that but I mean they're they're hired people so there's displacement so when the bricks and mortar stores go\nReally the only big thing to get hurt and you know some people are out of work that they can find jobs elsewhere it's the real estate that just sits there what's gonna happen with that stuff\nThat's a good question you know I Know that a a commercial real estate is you know ... you know suffering some issues right now some serious issue\nI mean if you were an investor would you buy a mall right about now\nNo no no but but it but I certainly would buy residential you would I Would buy residential every day of the week yeah it's a seller rent out yes\n[laughter] yeah no in fact I'm\nYou know I I have a house in um but ... Springs Florida and I and I have a house in in ... Connecticut and a half and half of Connecticut's four thousand square feet I don't know my wife and I just rattle around in it and what we've decided to do is we're going to rent it will get we're going to come up with an executive rental for it\nAnd and that's going to be necessary because people are going to come into our area that don't want to buy houses people will come into all areas that don't want ... got to be very big\nWell you've got the company like ear being beat up the rent townhouse houses and I mean yeah I Know people who own houses and they solicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nReally they're very happy ... oh yeah\nSolicit through air being be exclusively and they're making a lot of money doing that\nVery happy ... oh yeah and I I Would describe today\nIt what you're going to see in real estate across the board it you're going to see dramatic changes\nOne of the things that that's kind of puzzling me right now and I don't have an answer to it is this working from home and if that's going to you know remain in place and remain as as a major issue going forward because that was precipitated by a small labor force that essentially demanded\nA you know their own way but what we have now is a huge huge biggest labor force that we've ever had is a very young right now just entering the process\nCan I Want to talk with you about India when we come back and also we'll take final calls in just a moment how about your books can people still get them can\nOh yeah Casey direct dot com K.

[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nAnd welcome back to the coast to coast we're with Ken Goran back as we talk about trends what about India can they do in the same thing is China or are they in a different position\nThey are they are really in an entirely different position and and but they have their own problems there about one point four billion people in fact we're not really even sure how many people are in India but we we ah my best guess is that there's more people in India that there are in China\nBut they have about a two and a half trillion dollar GDP now and you know it may sound like a lot but when you compare that to the United states with twenty trillion GDP there's really no comparison so it it's it's not it is not enough and cover the biggest problem that India has is wealth distribution\nThey literally have have\nAnd have nots yeah and there's no\nOne in between and they they don't seem to be able to get a handle on that\nWhen when you had the haves and have nots aren't you creating civil unrest and everything else\nYeah you would think that but they kind of a passive people but I you know I I don't know you you would you would think that there would be kind of an unrest a because they're poor people are really poor and the rich people really rich\nAnd that's not what it between let's go to Josh in Toronto, Canada hey Josh thanks for calling go ahead\nAnd gentlemen I'm doing great thank you good I'm a longtime listener love your show George here every night even from art bell\nThank you Josh thanks for hanging in there with us so long\nAnyway I just want to touch on that Amazon thing I don't know if you get hurt and I don't know if you hurt a Amazon is opening now\nAnyway I just wanted to touch base on that Amazon thing I don't know if you are you're gets hurt and I don't know if you hurt but\nA Amazon is opening now Amazon Go stores and they're planning to open up a many many more three thousand in total by the end of the twenty Twenty one have you guys heard about that I Can't I have not\nThe water goes sores Josh\nAnd so basically you go in and you pick up a I guess the most popular items and you just\nBuy it right there retail wise and set up on line so at a retail store Amazon Go you're walking you pick out I guess the items that they have there and the most popular items I guess that selling that monitor that week or whatever and you just pick it up and go I guess cell phone charger things of that nature ah extra\nInteresting and I bet they would use their website to let you know what products are going to have in the store in any given time\nI'm sure that that's a great thing for ... or of the older generation who don't really feel comfortable with the computers they can just walk and pick out what they want and go it's Amazon Go\nInteresting take on Sundays and earlier Amazon ghost Sam's on go I'm gonna go somewhere mind with Halloween coming up you know\nTo think did the concern that I Would have about that is the same concern that I had with Amazon taking over a whole foods and that is a when you have a brick and mortar store retailers details of very very\nA kind of business Amazon has succeeded in so I don't know let's let's see what they do with this\nThat could be intriguing yeah could be I ... you know whenever you\nSometimes are people that are successful get caught up in your own success and think they can do\nEverything everything that's right\nYeah and so the the whole whole foods thing is sort of successful but I don't know I really don't know if they're going to make it with that\nLet's go to ...

sleep and I slept soundly and when I woke up I was completely fine and and my mother and my grandmother said it was it was a miracle and that it was the guardian angel that had had saved me so that was the first experience and experience and I never question did I just said okay that's\nThat's what happens and I think that's what open the floodgates and and and also my mother was very psychic too she wasn't a practicing cycling right to see 'em\nThere's always this seems to be somebody in the family who has this ability and it kind of passes down genetically doesn't it I\nI I Believe it does because her mother was also that way she was an herbalist she was a healer so in ... and this is a very remote island at that point in the sixties they're the only way onto the island was by a\nA small plane or buy a ferry or vote or there was no bridge to that island so there's very remote there's no hospital so uh you know they they needed the services of folk healers and and and that's what my grandmother did my mother's mother\nWere to science fit into this Bruce I mean the you know you're you're you're in academia um yeah ... where does science fit in\nWell I I've been doing a lot of reading and a and you know I'm not a scientist but I did I've done a lot of reading and quantum physics and\nAnd I talk a lot to uh I I have communication with folks that have passed on and and that happened randomly before but now I figured out a way to make it more regular but\nSo I've asked all awful lot of questions and I've done a lot of reading and I've met people like dean raven who are just you know wonderful and very easy to talk to and explain difficult things and from what I understand what I Believe is that the the paranormal the paranormal world is actually the quantum world\nSo by studying quantum mechanics\nAnd how that works I think I have a good idea of how the paranormal world works and I've come up with a model or\nIs it how I I fit in what what I understand to be going on now you know tell them to tell us what that model might be\nWell the idea is that uh that I okay I I'll I'll look at it this way so I ... in the morning I take these I I call them a a meditative walks so so when I'm walking\nMy one way of looking at me and said I'm I'm a a a a particle being I Am a bean physical being\nBut if you see that I'm I'm moving and if you look at uh like in in in fast motion or whatever I Would be like a blur so I'm really I'm a I'm a wave more than I Am a a a a particle being\nAnd I and my my location is is not just in one place so I I kind of see that in the in the quantum world that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know that some in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world\nMoral that's that's what it is everything is in wave form and we don't see the world that way because you know the ... in the subatomic world but if you take it up to the macroscopic world and you think about that ah that\nI I'm not in any one location and and uh and and that's kinda how how I see it and and I think that that helps me understand how\nHow this works and the the other thing is these near death experiences that I've had a like for instance I think we have many forks and what I call forks and the road of time I talk about that in the book\nWhere we experience a maybe a near death experience or a close call and I've had a couple of those and in one dimension I think this word comes into you know a different dimensions\nI think that we we might die in that particular thing that that incident and in others we we live on is if that didn't happen uh and and sometimes we have knowledge of what the incident might have been or maybe sometimes we don't\nAnd uh and then we can have many of these forks in the road of time throughout our our our lives and keep going from one life to the next\n... but at the same time that we're doing that there's this spiritual part of us so there's actually two part there's the physical form and then there's the spiritual form or that that is eternal and that's where I come up with the uh the title of the book which is timeless that that we don't really\nEver die\nAnd ... you have documented thirty for pure ... cases that happened to you have there been more you just didn't put them all in the book\nYeah ah [laughter] there there's a lot more and I have I've already written the second book it'll come out next year I call it timeless deja vu and uh I have twenty eight more experiences and I I I I kinda wanted to test the waters with the first book\nOkay I have I saved some of the more well I'll just say a little bit more bizarre stuff for the second book based on the reaction of the first\nOne well sounds like we're going to have your back about the same time next year huh\nAnd I and I yeah I plan to release it about you know the late summer early fall and and then I I also have a third book plan too so I I there's a lot of the incidents the they keep happening\nI I was going to ask you about deja vu because and we'll save a lot of it for the next book but ah you had mentioned the experiences where you know you may have died in one life but not in another do you think that\nSometimes we might have memory of other existence is in other parallel universes and that's why we have deja vu\nI I I Believe so in fact uh I I remember as a as a kid and this is interesting because I think\nChildren are very open to the spirit world or the paranormal world but third ... that's kind of over the years it's kind of a through our education system or sometimes maybe by their parents are different\nOrganizations it's kind of a you know drained out of them but I remember as a kid thinking I Wonder if I have already died and I'm somebody else now I think I Am and it's and and I don't necessarily remember a previous life experience from that but I I remember thinking that a lot I mean a lot\nAnd uh so I I I think that's interesting that that children have those those are you know those kinds of feelings but I'll give you an incident that happened just recently with me and my son we were driving here in Southern California on a sub surface streets and I\nI look down just momentarily I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor monument or whatever and I looked up and\nWhen I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a ...\nReally I don't know what it was something that dropped onto the floor of my rock or whatever and I looked up and when I looked up and I thought it was just a split second here I was hurdling through a red light\nOh it was terrible and and how will the sun\nOr he's he's Eighteen okay he's sitting in the in the passenger seat and freaking out yeah he\nHe is and we're going through the intersection and on either side of it is a car you know two cars coming right out of so what was going to happen that I can see was that we're going to get T bone from both sides and just you know ... a pinch between the two\nUh and uh at that moment everything's slowed down ... everything's slowed down and it was if I had all the time in the world to figure out how I was\nGoing to maneuver your way around a yeah and the next\nThing I Know I I I maneuvered through and next thing I Know we're on the other side there was honking going on in the cars when everybody was safe and a time got back to normal speed again\nAnd I I think that I think what what happens is that we had we had glimpse the quantum world at that point and then the quantum world and in the paranormal world as my spirit friends have told me there there is no past there is no future it's all just\nAn internal now and\nAnd that that's what I felt like and I and then I thought this is probably this is an example of a fork in the road of time because then another dimension which we might have had this horrible accident knows it it it potentially at least the potential forty five miles an hour\nOh at each other like that or you\nKnow that there could have been people killed\nAnd it's at least seriously injured and ah and we were unscathed and so or the other two cars thank God I'm so it so I I I ... that is what I'm Talking about and I had other experiences that you know when I was younger I I at eight years old I had another uh experience where I\nI uh uh was playing around it was in ah I'm\nUp at deception pass I'm from Washington state and deception passing the north end to with the island there is a way to bridge fans that go from the mainland to\nWhip the island the north end and there's a middle island called pass island\nAnd we always used to stop there when when we went camping and we we'd run around and it was beautiful you know you can overlook the narrow channels that that that separate the island from the mainland and I was running around and of course in those days early sixties there were no safety fences or guard rails to speak up for them\nYeah they actually ... and I was running right towards the cliff and I remember running off the cliff and then\nEverything was I was just like suspended in in in in in mid air it was like everything stopped and once again I felt this this light in this warmth and the next thing I knew it was like everything it stopped and then all of a sudden boom like in fast motion I was back on the trail and my dad was grabbing my shoulders and was\nYelling somebody's watching Uber's there's a there's some

situations have you've stumbled into that\nYes unfortunately the way that it that is also out there in the paranormal world and the spirit world and sure of the things as far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very\nThe spirit world and shoes are these things\nAs far as I understand have never been human never will be human but they are very real and very scary opt out to a couple of them\nI'm One of them was a a lines about Eighteen years old I was in a very low place in my life very uh down\nI was a not very successful I dropped out of school a out of out of the University of Washington I was living at my brother's garage sleeping on the concrete floor in a mattress and a\n... just ... the night before this incident happened I I had cut across\nYou know I I was Eighteen but I was still acting like I was a little kid I'd still cut across yards and jump fences and stuff 'cause just to you know 'cause I it it just an old habit yeah anyway I went through the yard of of an old lady who all of us in the in the neighborhood thought she was a witch\nAnd uh she lived alone and there was a story I don't know if it was true that her husband had died and she left him there for a month and told the neighbors complain that you know there was something\nSome kind of odd smell and then uh anyway so she her legend grew by leaps and bounds\nSo I was ... I was cutting through her yard and I saw a candle light in the window and I just momentarily looked and there she was and she was very scary looking person she had you know this gray hair that was kind of shooting off and all direction\nYeah she had this she had the old ... syndrome right\nYes she had the ... camp as it turned out cancerous or on her nose and she had me I felt like a deer in headlights I was just frozen and I was just staring at her and she had it was either a it was a candle yeah she had a candle in the window\nAnd she was just staring at me and it it just scared me and finally I broke away from her gays and I ran to my brother's garage and I\nAnd I and I you know went into I fell asleep well\nLater that probably early in the morning I woke up to\nA very frightening site or at the foot of my the mattress bad that I was sleeping on the floor there was like a a call him a fire that was coming up out of the floor and I and I thought this is the worst during this is a horrible dream\nAnd so I pinch myself I slap myself\nAnd no I was awake in this column fire then spread over me in an arc from head from foot over my head you know probably six feet in the air and kind of like an art and like pulsating fire like a current a fire going over my head\nAnd it and if that wasn't scary enough there was also this this very dim what I Would classify as the demonic low gravelly voice speaking in in ... just these guttural tones\nAnd I'm not sure how long it lasts that it might have just been a couple of minutes but it seemed like it it took forever\nAnd ah it it was very very frightening and it was it was horrible and and I after it was over I was you know my heart rate was way up I was sweating I immediately called my my girlfriend and and uh I told her you know something terrible happened she said well\nYou know why don't you come over in in in the morning and I did and I explained it to her and she looked at me and she said uh\nWell you know uh I think maybe we should call a psychiatrist what do you think and I said well just forget it you know maybe I just made it up but of course I didn't they raised it happened\nI I think it had something to do with this this old lady I think that I had frightened or or major angry and something had been some and and I it was a terrible terrible thing\nAnd that that that's one of the experiences I've had it's one of the most scary things that's it that's ever happened to me and just as as I Do remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill them\nA that's ever happened to me and just as as I remember it as if it would just happened yesterday I could feel the heat I could hear that gravelly voice that just seemed to fill\nThe whole room and yeah it was it was it was horrible wouldn't want to go through that again would you\nKnow no it was it was it was very real very reel to reel and uh nothing that it it's like I think what happens is that these kinds of things you know when you're at the lowest point in your life and that's when you're susceptible a and I I think that that they seize that opportunity\nI think so too I mean they they know when you're down they know when you're on drugs or you're drunk yeah and that's when they get you and they get you a good time I don't want to dwell too much on the ... but tell us the other story\nWell the other one ah also of a foolish kind of thing or are there was actually a a I was in Germany I was a soldier in Germany at working at the prison the military prison and Mannheim West Germany when it was east and West Germany West Germany\nAnd uh there was a a a counselor at the prison of all people of counsellors like a senior in Seattle and he\nWas into a a a witchcraft so he had invited me and my girlfriend to his his room to it 'cause he was bragging about what a you know powerful war locker which or whatever that he wasn't\nAt the time I was kind of I'm kind of interest that kind of you know skeptical but interested so we went in there it into his room and he had this very frightening set up you know very typical Satan worshipping kind of stuff upside down across uh\nA goats had kind of thing going on and candles and ... and that stuff so I said well I you know I don't think this is anything that I'm interested in and they got my girlfriend and we left and\nAnd he was being very very spooky and very scary about this whole thing and and uh so I decided that I was going to look into a a you know this kind of thing so I I\nI thought maybe as a defense you know I maybe I should try to one up and try to scare him or something and and uh and I also felt like maybe he was trying to move in on my girlfriend too so I had a little bit of that you know kind of thing going on competitive thing\nSo I I went to the uh you know for soldiers they had a art rooms or like arts and crafts areas and and uh there was a a um [noise] uh ceramics instructor there and he I asked I'd like to you know do something with some clay and he said gave me some clay and\nI had been looking at a demon knowledge the book and a or no no he had a demon algae but that's what it was and I was fashioning a a what I thought would be you know some kind of scary looking head and it turned out to be a demon head\nNorth than I Am fashioned and this was just you know very stupid to be doing this and as I was doing this this guy took notice of me this instructor then he had the steam analogy book\nAnd uh he said you know I'm very interested in this what is this year doing I said well I'm just trying to make this scary looking ahead to scare the sky and he said well that's\nThat's very very interesting you know I'm very interested in in the mineralogy and he started to get really strange you know just like the counselor at the prison he was acting very strange like they were maybe birds of a feather or something\nAnd uh so I finished this demon head and I got out of there and I took it back to the barracks and I took it to my girlfriend's room and she wasn't there at the time but her ... her girlfriend a roommate let me in\nAnd I set it up on her night stand and there was like this mirror behind it and I said okay I'm going to freak her out and then I'm going to freak her out and then we're going to go and freak out this other guy and get him to get you know get away from us\nSo I set up these scandals around it stupid right\nSo uh I was the was the intent was\nTo get you know get away from us so I set up these candles surrounded stupid right\nSo uh I was there was the intent was good right\nIt it was it was maybe a good intent but it was playing with stuff I didn't understand so I'm sitting there looking at it and the girlfriend left I mean the the uh the roommate left and I was just there by myself sitting there staring at the ... all of a sudden it's lips started to move\nAnd it started to say things in that same kind of guttural voice that I had heard of before I joined the army and that that other incident that I told you about and uh it was it was it was pretty scary and I thought at first this isn't real but then they kept happening and then my girlfriend walked in\nAnd she immediately said what are you doing and I said well your roommate Libyan and then she says what does that and she pointed to and I said oh that's this thing I made to scare the you know this councilor guy\nAnd she said you know that's very interesting because when I was in she was telling me when I was in high school I made something that looked exactly like that and I had to throw it away because it started to interact with me and I and I said well that hey that's what this did you know and she\nShe freaked out she grabbed it she opened up the window and from the third floor she threw it out the window into the dumpster that was down on the in the parking lot and she said you don't ever play around with that kind of stuff\nAnd uh so that was the other a kind of demonic or incident that I that I had so that the the big lesson there's don't play around with things you don't understand even if the intention might be ... or something like good\nShopping thing in Nevada pregnant women are getting the highest priority for Senate continues treatment no kind

all of a short time with us his work timeless and that we're going to take your calls and your stories as well as more is when we come back down the coast to coast that yeah [noise] [noise]\n\nHi

side effects\nAnd then all of a sudden I I went back into the bedroom and on the night stand there was everything was vibrating like there was an earthquake but there was nothing else in the room that was moving and it was just the stuff on the night stand there was my wife's ah my wife at the time\nOr her hand mirror or a clock and a few other little items that were on the night standard vibrating in some of them fell off\nAnd I put them back on there and and and then it it kept vibrating again and then I just happened to look out the window\nAnd there was like a Greenbelt behind our apartment behind discussed house this far and there was a Green Belt and then there was another uh apartment building maybe four stories high much bigger a complex\nAnd I looked directly into this window and there was a man standing there it looked like a man and he was very dark and he was a in kind of in the shadows but I could see there was a figure of a man and he was pointing at me\nAnd and I went out with a ... singer I Hope no not a voting thing it was just\nIt just seemed like a guy but he was moving in a very strange way so I looked at him as soon as I think he recognizes I looked at him the vibration stopped\nSo I I don't know what he was doing or what what reason he would have for doing it or what you know obviously you had some kind of tell the kinetic powers\nBecause it was related to what was going on 'cause as soon as he moved away from that window and there was he wasn't there the the the items stopped and I you know you know and I didn't have that feeling that somebody pulling me off to bed so it was that was pretty frightening because I didn't know what he was up to whatever it was was not good I can guarantee that\nI'm going to hinge Bruce that when you went through that red light and you made it through all lives loser reason you're still here have you figured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what this vision I had two years ago my friend gene\nFigured out what the reason is yeah\nYeah and uh it's it's related to what the this vision I had two years ago with my friend gene who came to me and\nTold me it was time it was time to tell these stories to not be afraid to tell the stories people will come it's kind of like the old you\nKnow field of dreams build it and they will come a and that's exactly what what has been happening everything that he said uh is that I I I think I Do have a mission I I I I Know that you know I I think the fact that I\nHave all these credentials and stuff maybe that helps people accepted more but it it it's unfortunate that it should be that way but I think it does kind of you know give people the idea that uh you know maybe he's he's more credible but\nI you know I don't know but I Do know that I I Do have this mission to get these stories out and to help people understand and to support people like a scientist like dean rating and others in trying to figure this out\nYou know and and are you know very chronically under funded because there's you know there it's difficult for them to get funding\nAnd I think this is it's probably one of the most important things that we can we can do in our lives is is try to figure out how this the spiritual world works\nAnd it and it gives great comfort to people when I I I although I don't I'm not a practicing medium I Do\nI I Am able to to to do it and I I share this with my friends and family members and and people who um you know who asked me I don't do it for money or anything just do it because I feel it's a service to my fellow a human beings\nAnd it provides them with comfort and and it doesn't work every time you know a ... and I know there Charlotte ... out there and then and there are some real people they do for a\nLiving and I don't I don't ah you know begrudge them to make a living of it you know fair living as long as they're providing a a a decent service for people\nBut uh it it is it is real it's very real and ah they've tried to that is one of the more difficult things for scientists to research although they've noticed\nThat when people say they're having a spiritual connection that later proves to be you know you know they got some things right about this person's a loved one\nA there is certain parts of the brain that they can pick up I guess some kind of imaging I don't know if they use an MRI or what they do but uh so there is there is something that doesn't prove necessarily but it does show that there is something going on\nUh in in there is a a a connection being made 'em and uh so I I that I that that is the mission that I'm On the mission I mine is too is to convey what I've found out and what I asked my friend Jean and\nAnd uh there's another lady that passed on three years ago she was a colleague of mine and a good friend and and I also have some contact with her and I've asked them a lot of questions when I go on this walking meditation that I Do quite often\nAnd uh and connect with them and and\nThe things that I've learned are are are are pretty amazing and I I Want to share them with people and I and I I feel that I have to do it it I Want to do it but I feel like I have to do it too it's kind of like all the books I've written all the plays that I've written\nI felt compelled to do it it wasn't just something I sat down okay I'm going to write a play or I'm gonna write a book it's always I feel compelled to do it I have to do it\nAnd I'm more than happy to to you know to to do this and and help people and I think I I have help some people\nWell let's go to the phones for you if they have a story I'll have you with value waited for is Bruce up it's just a question then take it away Thomas a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce while I\nAnd then they could wait time is a lawyer California Hi Thomas\nI charge thank you for taking my call and Bruce wild I promised my question Bruce I'm you spoke about your near accidents in the intersection\nAnd job comment and question the comment is angels appear to be non denominational they appear at\nChristianity and Islam Hindu was some Buddhism dour some and then all of the indigenous traditions around the world whether they're called angels are being supple light whatever my question to you\nSent you metaphorically dodged a bullet in that\nIntersection\nHow can the average man they average woman develop cultivate if you will a close personal relationship\nWith their guardian angels day by day even hour by hour or something that is tangible with absolute certainty\nWell that's that's a that's a very good question and I I Will uh started off by saying that that everybody has these abilities are often the light lie dormant sure because\nOf you know ... when we were children we probably had you know pretty equal abilities and there's some people that have a little bit more than others but then\nThrough the experiences that people have the the accepted more and more and they're closer to the the spirit world so I'd say doing whatever you can to get a closer to that spirit world some people do it through meditation\nI just let it randomly happen because the door seem to be open since age for so it never quite shut so things kept happening but now I've\nI've learned to through meditation or ... when I called walking meditation all explaining I'm I Can't sit still very very long so I I have trouble doing the lotus position you know kind of traditional meditation so I I go on a walk and uh that's when I can get into the I guess what scientists would call an alpha brainwave state\nAnd at that point is when I can I I'll say a prayer\nA and I I I Do believe in God and they say prayers even when I'm not meditating but any way I Will I Will ask my guardian angel or some people practicing a professional uh mediums will say these are your spirit guides you know\nUm and I will ask them to help me to connect to those that are that are passed on and to receive whatever messages they have\nAnd uh and and to help people if they have messages they want me to pass on to their loved ones which is usually what it is\nAnd I I Would say just having a practice of that I Do it almost every day my foot has hurt right now so I haven't been able to do it so I feel kind of stifles but the last couple of days but uh\nMaking a practice of that type of mindful meditation and what my spirit friends tell me that and what I've they told me to tell my students in the class is to have what they call focused calm to be focused but be very calm\nAnd as you were doing this meditation and it will it will happen it might happen slowly it might not be you know like a an immediate you know like an epiphany or are very profound at first it might just come slowly might even think it's your imagination but it's not it'll it'll keep building day by day\nAnd before you know it you you have you're more in touch with these things and you can also when you when the door opens\nYou'll ... you'll go back in time and see oh my gosh I've had the\nWith these things and you can also

I got you know you can find them now and some of the cable channels but it's always hard\nIt's not the same though I mean I I was younger I lecture might tell our kids about this back in my day I'm at that age I'm forty three but and I kind of came of age it when that stuff is kind of on the outs just before infomercials ruled the world and you'd stay up late at night and my exposure was that the buyout buffalo channel called WBRC it was the cat's pajamas\nAnd they'd run twilight zone reruns and stuff like Death Valley days but then they kind of sign up for the night and they throw on a horror movie without any commercials and that was my life that's how I saw black you allow the Roger Corman Vincent Price movies\nYou know ... superheroes yeah well the ... the genes in his was the demon ... fire and most importantly he drew blood everywhere which was a he still does I mean the guys almost seven years old and he's still ... spent blood everywhere\nUm so the shows where like living breathing I'm you know ... circus horror films you know and they they still kind of are\nWhat is it about horror films in the world community they just captures people and it doesn't capture everybody but when it does capture you you're in it for life\nI well I mean I think the reason why we watch are maybe not I think I Know I'm all entertainment as a window into our what we are as a species as a culture and you know unfortunately we are all going to die and some of this we're going to die violently so we're fascinated\nBy that and uh I think we spend our entire lives trying to run that grim truth and I think what horror movies do is they hammered them home right in your face you confront your mortality in a very safe benign fantastical way\nSo that when the lights come up at the end of that screening or wherever you are um you feel like in a wave kind of mastered your anxieties about death\nUm so that's the appeal of of all dark fiction and dark entertainment\nAs far as the culture I'll tell you for me I mean again I was the guy with the briefcase and the ... and I did it because the ladies loved it and uh you know the guys wanted to be me they thought it was cool\nA so horrors is very sympathetic like we said with cast with rock and roll it's rebellion it's the counter culture it's all those things your mom and your dad and your preacher warrant you not to look at of course you're going to look at them so it really doesn't form in a way I'm young people's if they grab it\nAll those things your mom and your dad and your preacher warranted not to look at of course you're going to look at them so it really doesn't form in a way I'm young people's if they gravitate toward that young people's identities I'm rebelling against ah the mainstream\nIt's so funny because I never looked at it that way\nBut you can see it it's it's it's just so different than the people who actually uh well can can adjust to it or can enjoy it a little sure I I have twin sons in one\n... loves loves or a movie so I took him to see that horrible movie in a bell creation a weeks ago and one sitting there just in watching the whole thing and the other one is holding his bag of popcorn up in front of his face for the whole movie just because he can't you can't take it you can do it and\nUh yeah yeah I I I have three three little boys are cut from the same DNA and and yet they're so radically different the same exact thing but you know as far as kids go\nMean kids are generally we're hardwired to feel like the other you know and that's the monsters are they're the they're the outsider there the other the person just up on the outside of the mainstream looking in trying to be part of everything so I think that's why young people gravitate towards these these kinds of films these monster movies is that the identify with\nBeing the other you know\nWe we knew why a lot of teenagers will go to the horror movies you know the whole the whole team slasher thing I mean a lot of it is a you know the the guy wants to take the girls or something that she's going to be scared so that she you know we'll get a little closer\nWhen I was in his hand yeah again yeah you know I mean it's gotta it's got this kind of is it'll try that with all of that um\nBut there's there's a you know a whole I mean do adults do it to not for the same reasons and\nUm it seems to me that um when we go to view a horror movie in a lot of ways we're not just looking at some form of entertainment that is giving a you know a ... making ... slow but we're also seeing a reflection of maybe what contemporary society\nOf what our fears of that society might be\nWell that this is true and again I've always said this my entire life you know a couple of things in a odd from Washington consuming a fantastical dark violence often violent entertainment and yeah and I've never really been in a fist fight on the most kind of you know peaceful job guide ever want to meet\n'em but as far as horror movies reflecting culture goes I've always said as well but if you really want to study any society um well look at their pop culture I guess looking prior to film look at any of their literature and it kind of output in that respect but film is is you know combined to all the liberal arts into one big bang\nAnd just look at the cinema specifically their horse sentiment if you really want to tap into their anxieties and views about a a God and and the devil and and the supernatural and and and the afterlife\nAnd a sex I mean look at heart I look at it when the Nazis were starting to maryott
