government surveillance older level still that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional um aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and it's a famous case uh from Brazil where these young man named Antonio village ...\nClaim to being taken on board a UFO on as you said he had sex with these beautiful looking um I live in woman\nAnd I'm I'm ... sense of purpose if he was taken on board against these will so he was abducted you know it was a Nineteen abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know it's either perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of an Sonia ... was\nAll you know it was a really weird aspects of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspects of the story a which places an entirely different slant on it until now if you read casually Antonio ... a report that he put together\nFor um a Brazilian a UFO researcher and a doctor named a lot of fun says\nUm he talks about how they craft that he was taken on board um came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making the Beijing noise\nAnd that kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape\nThey the spinning disk on top of the roses and the Beijing noise says what the classics and you get with a helicopter\nNow mine came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's still didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told a race or you know research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd that's going but it really did evolve a helicopter but they targeted um ... hours he was out of work and then failed lights at night\nUm they release some sort of average ... aerosol\nEr which incapacitated and took him on board the helicopter and the the a woman was really that and the part was played out um but he is in a sort of an old to states wasn't sure what was going on and that was sort of ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd they the the rate of the story was that the agencies within governments\nThat might well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad Monday through the fifties while the\nSpain rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad mind is the fifties while the CIA eyes and ... and things like they the plan was to try and determine\nTo what extent the human mind could be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say highly ... we can convince them and anything that\nWas basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um\nThat they they the abduction if you like was played out and buy kind of just then sat back and white to to say how much of the story was taken and I went I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was apparent in books\nIt was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases\nWhere the um the principal targets that it's something beyond just some alien presents there's military or government involvement\nYeah I mean they should where it gets confusing if they're you know throughout January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind\nCan be altered and they use the UFO angle is the most taste to try and you know um to see how it works on people doesn't with so you know it gets really confusing when that could be rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves to nominate itself or are they doing both and just not feeling\nWell yeah I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because it's some of the duct tape that I spoke with said that they don't have a number of occasions I'd actually being visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more\nThan the military personnel were actually approaching the abductees quietly\nRequesting that they didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't some some of them have but they basically they that ... it was as if the military were asking questions\nUm along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why this is being done so in other words they were trying to get to the hearts of what the abductions where why that were being done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um surveillance of the of the outlook pays a good example\nOn somebody um who is tied to coast to coast I'm Greg bishop I'm Greg tell me how um he had to pay the correspondence in the Nineteen uh ninety's a duck to college or who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nOn Greg told me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the ... that I wrote to each other back and forth\nWere opened an sailed back down with type and I'm now they can clearly be done you know a family without making it look like the envelope was ... to an open race failed\nIt was almost as if whoever was doing base wants to Greg and college and to know that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching you and that went on you know for for quite a period\nOf ... working tonight on our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nArea a Greg is working tonight at our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name I was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know um are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction then I think sometimes people can become sort of\nParanoid of every little thing in their life you know which diet just wrote you go down um but in saying that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many people associate it with capital the education's\nI'll tell you what network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side I'll save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then or we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons five Nineteen Seventy one [noise]\nI Can't imagine what the total dollar amount\nOther kinds of creatures but a kennel or the the ones we know best that have been publicized most I Can't imagine what the total dollar amount of losses for the livestock boss who's ranchers and farmers could be but it's pretty substantial and when you look at how the government has responded yesterday I\nHad some ... agents who looked down at a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you're discussing this book\nWell yeah I think you know the the black helicopter phenomenon I'm clearly a real one um it does seem to be tied to both capital mutations\nAnd um the Eileen abduction phenomena and one of the things that's as being notice and I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that operates\nOutside of government you know my actually my sort of do research and work for the government\nBut it's not you know the CIA or anybody like ... I don't think I think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and\nIn most faith in government don't know anything about it at all because it might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government\nItself you know it might have been even\nSort of ... to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by ah by the freedom of information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon these rail and I think whether it's ... or abductions the Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out\nWhat's going on you know there there's so many cases of black helicopters and an ... helicopters\nTurning up near the homes sometime precariously there the homes\nI buy duct tape and again kind of light with college or in Greg\nBase might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abductees 'em\nAnd be able to to respond as high speed if in in the event that they have that the papal flying cops his were actually able to catch an abduction going ahead you know in the sense of that very time\nSomebody who's the tuning in tonight for the first time I think we're all crazy alien abductions cattle mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah stuff happens\nBut the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in the dirt agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about\nWho's responsible and why this happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nTape the information to themselves unless it needs to be shed and if we dealing with as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more\nActually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more\nDifficult but I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages I'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations\nI'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... and I'm bored of the United states and in the lots of parts of Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other cases including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas so\nI think we're seeing a pot and on and I think some violence and intimidation of sort of the the mine coal and caused the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences literally\nReal or not it it's tough to even though there are some really well documented it's tough to figure it out and it's what someone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up moms are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there is still coming out about those are new to you the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the jury because no one's going to come out in December and then there's a book that's going to be published a I think after the first year\nAnd a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know was on stories always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you are right but one of the things I've always found about ... is unlike a lot of people who hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know they are and I think the big difference we'd lives are is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was never expanded on it he tells the same stories at eight Thirty years ago\nHe's hardly try to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth it doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average hoax so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nUm between the abductions\nAnd people who claimed that in some way or another they the the graze the Iranian Gray's who do the abductions that somehow they have this\nDeep and sort of sinister and disturbing entrenched in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this this portion of very fifty while he was working at allegedly and um\nHe said that was the the Iranians or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um and he speculates on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of\nObsessive interesting in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is I'm a number of ...\nOf ... in the human cell and one of the things I talk about in the book is I'm a number of abduct pays who were approached climbed steadily by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still asked questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you bought a veal salt leaving your body um did\nYou have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the question was kind of do child wave this story that was always telling as well\nYou know you you look at recent developments in regard to the UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project ... book they're not studying it it's no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it\nAnd now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but that was the cover story and and now we've learned last ten months that wasn't true that there were on going studies were more than one in fact that they were collecting information\nWhat seems like you know presumably is ridiculous topic um in light of the kind of a while that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOr do you have concerns about the recent revelation I I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner wary of this you know they there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know they ... they sign glove um rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on\nYou know you put all this together and um you know ... ... it really is sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um and again that's why you know went on the way I've written the book is to demonstrate what we know the U.S is you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then\nAt the same time also investigating legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um you know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines of really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is\nOthers do you based on

the experiences that people report over the centuries things that happened to them for real or not real they can't exist and therefore they don't\nYou know the disconnect between centuries of human experience\nAnd rigid doctrine is maybe one reason why so many people have given up on science in ways that are probably inappropriate and unfair and also possibly dangerous is there a way to reconcile\nThe seemingly bizarre experiences that people have reported through the centuries out of body experiences missing time time slips near death encounters other realities of science versus spirituality science and religion is their way to bridge all of that well Dr Christopher white has written a remarkable new book\nThat offers a unique and new understanding of topics that we often discuss here on this program but can't really explain\nI'm so this this is the possibility raised by math mathematician and and actually others some philosophers on in the\nGoing back to the Eighteenth century but really in the nineteenth century mathematicians raised the possibility raised seems like kind of a strange thing to think about ... how could there be another direction or dimension to reality\nUm you know and why would there be one well mathematicians in the nineteenth century start to use this idea within the context of their mathematical equations and\nThe reason they do is they want to want to make the mathematics of of the universe of its forces in laws more simple and more elegant 'em and they find that they find that it works um they find that they find corporate in an extra spatial dimensions\nFourth visual dimension that the the mathematics of the universe is a law enforcers look that are on the equations cleaner they seemed simpler and more elegant um um and so on\nSo and in fact just to get forward to today today you still have mathematicians doing the same thing um you still have mathematicians incorporating within the context of their um [noise]\nUh within the context of their mathematical equations higher spatial dimensions not not just for the spatial dimensions but even fifth sixth seventh even more and these are string theorist I don't know um if you are your members every audience have heard of string theory\nBut sure yeah I'm using\nSo yes there's string theory M theory brain theory so these these are basically mathematical theories that incorporate these other dimensions and and they do it again in order to\nMake make simpler and more elegant the basic equations that govern covering the universe\nTheir string theorists in um theoretical physicists mathematicians who do this are really trying to wrestle with one problem that really is the the biggest problem in modern physics\nAnd the problem is that we have two sets of equations that seemed to govern reality um and we know that both sets of equations are correct but we also know that they don't fit together\nWe have we have\nWe have a set of equations that govern very small things in the universe and I'm a governor governor subatomic world that the er the atomic world world of quantum and we know those equations work you know the correct on the other hand we have a set of equations that govern the movement hum\nOf the of the very large so planets and sons and galaxies and so on hum and these are Einstein's\nTheory of general relativity we we know both of those sets of equations are correct but we also can't see a way for them to fit together they don't they don't fit together so string theorists and others are assuming that there are additional spatial dimensions\nAnd they're using them in order to come up with a single set of mathematical equations that would be encompassing and that would put together the other the other equations that we have it\nBetween sort of the ... version and wondering version you have things like spooky action at a distance or which scientists have struggled to explain entanglement theory right\nOh absolutely absolutely yeah I mean you know a\nMathematicians who who work on on these subjects I'm also have to wrestle with other mysteries right there are other mysteries revealed by quantum mechanics for sure [laughter] you know they're they're definitely trying to wrestle with the problem of having two sets of equations that don't fit together\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange in ...\nAnd they're and they're using higher dimensional concepts to try to try to work on that but as you say yes there's there's other strange an uncanny on implications of of quantum physics that uh that that have found their way into pop culture for sure you know and\nAnd ... and all these ideas I think to some extent have found their way into pop culture and I try to talk about that in the book as well write the book is not just about scientists working on these ideas the book is\nAbout scientists working on these ideas but then I'm a scientist who doesn't have religious experiences and then try to use these ideas to think about them and then even other people who who have religious experiences and start to talk about them as higher dimensional or or somehow related to some some concepts and says X\nOr maybe we could use flat land as an illustration it's both an illustration and sort of an inspiration for a lot of the people who you write about in this book or tell us about flat land and I guess it was a pop culture phenomenon when it came out\nYeah absolutely yeah flatland the great little book um so ... kind of a classic science fiction or nonfiction book written a long time ago a written and Eighteen eighty four\nBut it has quite a cultural life and in fact I remember reading flatland in high school calculus so ... you know math students\nAll over the world still read flat land as a way of kind of expanding are thinking about you know what is it what does it mean to live in uh the kinds of spaces and kind of dimensions we live in so yeah it's a great little book written by an Anglican priest named Edwin Abbott\nHe was British he was he was raised in the middle of the nineteenth century I'm coming to coming to age in a in an era of science and wrestling with what it meant to be religious and scientific at the same time\nUm you know it was a time you know this Eighteen fifty nine was Darwin's origin of species and there were a number of\nUm there were a number of challenges I guess you'd say to Christianity and Edwin Abbott time so he he ended up writing this wonderful book flat land\nWhich is a book about a lower dimensional two dimensional world and he wrote it in order to get people to get people think more about the possibility that\nUm other kinds of world could exist um imbedded in in our own may maybe we live in a higher dimensional universe\nBut habits flat world was that was a two dimensional world the book takes place in a two dimensional world this is a flat world that might exist you know on on the surface of your table pop right so this this is a world that's completely flat and his populated by\nTwo dimensional objects objects with just linked in which they some of them were flaps where some of them were black circles are flat triangles and and even even lines they would all slide around on the surface of this flat world\nAnd of course they believe that uh they lived in a two dimensional world until the climax until the climax of the of the novel when\nA three dimensional object a sphere inserts itself goes down in in ... inserts itself into the plane of flat land and there's a square character who looks\nOut on his his flat land the rise and sees the appearance of this mysterious object you started talking to them and the sphere says I'm you know I I'm I'm a three dimensional object then I come from another\nAnother world in the square says this can't be possible\nIn the sphere just cannot convince the square that they're flat a two dimensional world is better than a larger world so the sphere resorts to a more um extreme measure any he reaches over and pulls a square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nExtreme measure any he reaches over and pulls a square off of the plane world of flat lining up into three dimensional space and\nOf course the than the square looks around and which down on his flat world that can for the first time see the whole world spread out in front of them [noise] so the square becomes a sort of a believer\nIn the existence of a higher dimension that there's a there's a third dimension he goes back to his flat world of course and it's pretty enthusiastic about this I Can't can't stay quiet about it and unfortunately in ... it's forbidden\nIt's forbidden by the by the high priest to talk about the existence of hired mentioned so he's put in jail where he\nWhere he pays for a number of your ears and and the story ends\nWith the four or five square languishing in prison I'm\nHoping that by his readers ... from his readers will be visionary enough to accept that there might be a more than meets the eye to to their reality so he sort of\nLike the idea that the high priest a flat land wouldn't allow or anybody to talk about the other dimension I'm In a commentary on sort of maybe rigid dogma of our time\nYeah yeah exactly exactly he and he was he was very interesting comment on the\nSort of as you say the rigidity and and the social norms of Victorian England you know when he where he lived right the sort of had to stay in your line and not have any wild um any wild thoughts but at the square character did have these wild Boston and even at the stationary experience right where he saw that there was\nThat there was another space or direction to reality and I'm so happy I wrote the book just to kind of encourage people to [noise]\nYou know think about the possibility that above our three spaces are three spatial dimensions there might be others um that we don't see we go through our life um you know thinking about our world is the only world\nBut you know maybe maybe there's something beyond\nWell it's a it's fun to to talk about it on to imagine um but when you combine higher dimensions and the ...\nIt gets pretty complicated [laughter] um [laughter] I tell you what we're gonna we'll take we won't jump into that will take a break first and we'll come back and get into that the inspiration I some of the stories that you tell about people who are inspired by this idea\nAre very sad I mean people who embrace it and they they go through\nTrials in turmoil in trying to get their head around it as as I have a ... but we'll we'll get into that in a moment are talking with Christopher white about other world spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions of the doors break on through take us into the brick\n\nDefined on were George Nouri speaking go to the ... website and scroll down to the bottom and click your just humid or\nShine\nThe religion of their childhood and still feeling spiritual for sure and and having a spiritual and tuition and his ... am\nAnd wanting to find wanting to seek out other ways of of being religious and many of them turned to these you know fantastic scientific concepts like higher dimension has a new as a new more scientific way of thinking about\nUm you know the existence of other spiritual up levels are worlds to reality ... an interesting story as you say he he grows up he goes Oxford he\nHe falls into this kind of depression he's not sure about anything anymore and then he he makes he makes a move that I think not a lot of people would make it right and the situation as he he embraces mathematics and geometry as a kind of a\nAnd he kind of hangs onto that as the only sure thing that there's a way in which the map provide certainty 'em to him but I think of his stories a little bit unusual in that sense but then he developed\nAs I say in the book you develop the whole way of thinking about higher spatial dimensions and he gets very interested in the end the mathematics of higher dimensions which I mentioned earlier in our conversation\nAnd then he starts to think you know what if these what if these mathematical variables in my equation you know these higher higher dimensions but I'm using what if they actually have a real existence somehow um you know what if the math points to the real existence of these kinds of\nSpaces and he\nHe thought a lot about that and he he does\nPoints to the real existence of these kinds of spaces and he he thought a lot about that and he he does something unusual and kind of unique he he develops of way of what he thought of as sort of ... educating the senses in order to catch glimpses into this\nInto the higher dimensional world so he developed a system of re educating the senses that involves um new it involves a set of twenty seven cubes that are labeled a all twenty seven are labeled and stacked up into like a Rubik's Cube you know that's three by three by three\nUm and he and then he he memorize the positions of all of the squares and the Rubik's Cube and then he'll uh and then he'll rotate a Rubik's Cube and then he'll memorize all those positions\nIt's essentially sort of an imaginative\nUm exercise but he believed that by doing it you're able to train yourself to perceive beyond the normal range of perceptions that we have so you know his mathematical colleagues sort of shook their heads I think uh you know he was he was he was an assistant professor of math at Princeton a for a while\nBut he didn't he didn't get tenure you know when you're trying to get tenure you should be publishing and um and doing your research but instead he he was doing things like putting this this this cue these cubes that together and helping coach the Princeton baseball team and he actually he actually also invented a pitching gun which was one of the first\nUm I'm an automated pitching devices on ever invented so he did that and so he didn't get tenure Princeton [laughter] he uh he didn't do what he what he should have been doing but he went on to the University of Minnesota and then from there he just started writing popular books and articles about this idea that\nYou know that there may be higher spatial dimensions and and these [noise] you know our ways of thinking about these things might be a new way to a new scientific way to talk about spirituality but as you say he was just one there there are many others in the book who are\nSeeking for new scientific answers to their spiritual questions\nWell as you document and trace I mean the this idea catches on it gets into pop culture you got a free the mistakes and I I Would think con men and religious leaders who grab onto what do they all use this idea for their own purposes\nYeah absolutely absolutely I mean I think a lot of people then you know and now a lot of people in the last hundred years are interested in scientific ideas as ways of\nUm as as new ways of thinking about spirit or spirituality or afterlife for heaven and so on and so I'd Hitchens ideas and then a Abbott's ideas of course it's flat land both on both of their um\n[noise] you know the writings really become important so modern artists take up these ideas a spiritual writers take up these ideas a lot of religious people in the U.S and then in Europe pick up these ideas a number of Christians take up these ideas as well um you know another person in the book chapter seven\nChapter eight is is cs Lewis right which I'm ... who I'm sure many of your listeners have heard of cs Lewis ... in\n... the fame famous British a Christian I'm Christian apologist and Christian writer probably the most twenty century is most famous Christian writer he uh he incorporates these ideas as well you know he incorporates ideas about higher dimensions\nTo rethink Christian ideas such as the trinity um and he\nIncorporates them in a number of sermons ... and and his writings and then of course many people are familiar with the scent fantasy ride ends and the same ideas are on there as well he's got\nHe's got references higher dimensions and um and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he he was he was raised in the ...\nAnd and he uses these concepts there and and he he was interested in them spiritually to you know he he was he was raised in the church but then he becomes an atheist\nOr like many like many characters in my book actually um he goes off to war\nAnd becomes disillusioned there's a number of people in there you know precisely in there and James Bennett and I'm a number of people go off to World War one or World War two in the book and they have that they get into combat situations OJ W diamonds and they're also also in combat\nThings you have an ear and out of body experience right\nYeah right exactly a number of those people have these kinds of experiences that really shake them to the core and cause them to sort of rethink a reality and rethink religion and for\nSome of them those war experiences and disillusioned them and turn them off from religion but others are like like James Bennett\nA he has this kind of out of body experience right but I talked about in chapter six um\nWhich is a chapter really about dreams that seemed to predict the future I'm kind of a kind of a cool chapter I really like a chapter on so he has his out of body experience and then his his journey is trying to figure out how mathematics and science and especially the science of higher dimensions how that might help explain what happened to him\nWell let's talk about dreams a little bit I explain it to me how how this would work how the idea of dreams are they coming from somewhere else Ohio reality another reality\nYeah yeah yeah it's a fascinating and um your dreams seem to be important in just about every culture around the world um you know and in many cultures people have dream interpreters you know a special people who\nAre you tell your dream to and then they tell you what it means um and we have that in our culture too right we have all kinds of ah [laughter] we have all kinds of dream interpretation bucks and we have people like this with a psychotherapist Carl young who many people know about who\nIs is really important for people as they think about interpreting their dreams and so yeah uh people have long thought about the spiritual meaning of of dreams and in my book uh especially in that chapter six\nPeople are also wondering about the the spiritual meaning of dreams [noise] um [noise] in that book uh there's a figure who is his name is Jay W done who was a British\nAeronautical engineer also with soldier and and goes into combat and the second bowler war in South Africa right around the turn of the twentieth century he's he's in combat in Nineteen oh two [noise]\nAnd he starts to have dreams that\nThey're not surprised him he starts to have dreams are and nightmares really about terrible things happening and the dreams are then seem to happen in real life so he has\nHe has predict of dreams or what what are sometimes called pre cognitive dreams he has dreams that seem to predict the future\nAnd these these surprise him I'm like I said they they do begin as he's camped out\nUh with his with his platoon so they they seem to begin in combat situations and he started having them and he at first he wandered if he was maybe going insane I'm from the stress I'm In a battle in these kinds of things but he would have dreams\nAnd then he would wake up generally what happened was he would have dreams and then who wake up on the next day or the day after that or the day after that he'd open the newspaper and see the event in the newspaper so one one of the dreams that he talks about in one of his book\nHe has a dream where he sort of standing on a hill he's looking down the hill towards the ocean and he's obviously on an island\nRecognizes the island as as a someplace he's already been in his dreams\nSo towards the ocean and he's obviously on an island recognizes the island as as an someplace he's already been in this dreams he noticed is that there's cracks and fissures in the ground and the decisions are venting gas on the ground is rumbling people seem to be going about their business they're speaking French\nBut he's panic and he's\nHe's he's trying to alert people he's he knows that something's going to go wrong he knows it's going to be volcanic eruption so he's running around trying to get people's attention he doesn't speak French they don't seem to speak English he ends up talking to one official after another official after another no one really believes him and he ends up waking up and kind of a sweat in a panic\nNot a couple of days later he opens up the newspaper and he reads about this a catastrophic volcanic eruption and the island Martin ... the French speaking island Martinique\n'em and several of the details from his dream or correct um and some of them aren't some of them aren't as well and he tries to think I mean how could this be how could how could in in my dream pocket I've seen an event that hasn't happened\nAnd he he keeps it to themselves for a while but eventually discharged and has back to the u._k. where he he actually is a early inventor of airplanes um and his his it you can Google M.

take the cash\nI was going through capsules like I couldn't get enough it made me feel so much better\nYou know they're limited world they're they're lower dimensional world into some sort of higher dimensional space and many of them use language like um you know suddenly there I saw an altered geometry before me I'm an end the dimensions of the room changed and shifted and\nOthers talk about being able to see like in a hospital setting right if someone had a near death experience in a hospital setting others talked about rising up above the hospital setting and being able to see into different rooms in the hospital so once again at another case in which\nUm you know you you're raised into a higher spiritual dimension and then you can suddenly have this incredible powers the vision that you didn't have before you can see through walls right you can see in places that you are not um\nSo yeah people people and Moody's book um and and many others you know there's a lot of literature now about near death experiences they people do um sometimes use the language of higher dimensions to talk about what they experienced\nI'm not to say on says in the same category but you do a address say on this and the people's attempts to reach a\nHigher uh our or another world um [noise] you know what's\nGoing on with those folks are they is there any legitimacy to that or or do you not want to pass judgment on it\n\nYeah I don't know um you know it's funny it's funny writing a book like this because you know I've never had any of these experiences [laughter] I've never had a dream that seemed to predict the future um you know I've never had an out of body experience right or or some of the um some of the experiences I've talked about so\nYou know I Know deja vu a deja vu for sure yeah yeah I'm so in the book I Try to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are having um\nYou know and I try to put him play their voices and\nIn the book I tried to talk about a lot of experiences that other people are having um\nYou know and I tried to put in play their voices and and how they understand what's happening\nOn but I don't I don't know about San says you know I I wouldn't rule it out as being as being possible you know I mean I think that I mean if one thing if this book taught me one thing it would be that I think that the the world is is a much more complex and ah\nAnd amazing really than than we now uh you know I think there's much more to the universe than meets the guy um\nYou know I I I Do believe that a man and I think we know that from science I mean when you when you look at these or does this is a cosmologist and read their\nRead their narratives about the universe read there are popular science publications I mean there's just there's more to the universe than meets the eye and so I really wouldn't rule out um spirits are ghosts are all those kinds of things you know I\nI I wouldn't be so arrogant as to as to you know sit here and say oh you know you definitely there's no way that anyone could have an experience like that um\nSo I guess I Would just remain you know open to the open to those possibilities\nAnd you know I think when people would want to know is a is there a higher dimension that happened that would happen and if so do we go there and do we live live on beyond this\nYeah yeah right that's another big question that I Try to raise in the book you know the book is has all of these big questions um [noise]\nYou know and and I don't answer that question in the book I think that's another question like your question about spirits and goes and found says I'm I'm certainly open to the to the possibility there and and personally I I I Do believe that there is a nother world that we go to after this world me personally I Am I'm a believer you know I'm\nI Do believe in God and I do believe in spirit so I think I'm I think I line up more on that side of things with a kind of an openness to these different possibilities and like I say in the book I Try to put different voices in there who have different opinions and the reader kind of decide what they're saying you know I'm\nTrying to figure out what causes a bunch of folks on the phone to talk to you will go east of the Rockies Moses in Tallahassee Iran with Christopher white\nAnd you're more than ... cook's book when you go door\nTo

I I guess I could ask this question I don't know if you've ever read that J. D. priest leaves on national Christopher here if you've ever read the pre sleaze or sort of a big essay on um it's called man in time it was published along with uh with one of ... books\nAs out of the wonderful book at the great books yeah yeah oh good so you have read it will very good well I'd say anything you can say about it I'm the one of the biggest issues that have been happening\nIs a is with the I guess with physicists to particularly you seem to still be attached to it gets in the anthropology of physics it never really\nExamine they're\nThe they're sort of preconceived their prejudices that comes from their ... says this is why I suppose\nUh uh toward a about time about the issue of\nOf time and and you know sort of what it is how it arises how would it can be even a fundamental dimension of our ah reality in and also the whole perception or not just the time but uh I mean\nI I when I look at things in a quantum level we we see that everything is everything is is a sort of wave and I mean of course people don't even have waves are frequencies are but the time becomes very essential to just the existence of matter\n[laughter] you do an art project or a perception of it anyway so I mean they're just\nAs any way they have any comments or thoughts about the\nThank you Charles appreciate you go\nThat's that's a great question and that's a that's a wonderful book come J. B. briefly I talk about in chapter six quite a bit he's a fascinating character I'm a very famous British writer playwright and twentieth century and BBC broadcaster\nHe gets really I'm interested in higher dimensions um he reads hints and who we talked about he reads Jay W done who have talked about 'em and he'd comes up and developed his own theories\nInterestingly precisely like some of the other figures in the book has a combat experience he also fights in World War one of the young person and as um as an injured [noise]\nUm and he also has some he also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time feeling like he's out of body and then he writes this\nHe also has some unique experiences of feeling like he's out of time or feeling like he's out of body and then he writes this great book that the caller mentioned are called man and time\nUm and in the book you have all kinds of testimonials from people who have written about their pre cognitive dream or dreams that seem to predict future events um he actually gets on the BBC\nIn Nineteen sixty two or three can't remember\nAnd he he asked the the viewing audience to write him letters if they've ever had an unusual time they've ever slipped out of time they've ever had a dream that predict the future and\nUh he got over Fifteen hundred letters um from from the from the viewing audience but like many let us know extent still at the University of Bradford I've been to redraw the letters and I I incorporate\nA number of time in my book that will be a Christian or white will take a break we are talking about other worlds with Chris white and Tom Petty takes as it into the break we'll get to more of your calls and questions in a moment\nAnd all the head and you know the moving pictures\nAnd all of a sudden you'll see moving pictures because light changes and you move and you see faces and people and all ... chairs and hair styles and it's just lovely have you ever\nTried the selection exercises\nYeah no I I've never tried reflection of exercises although in my book I talk a bit about um [noise]\nAnd actually some classes I teach at Vassar College I talk about meditations on reflective surfaces so you know there's\nThere's even iPhones crying you know I don't know if you've heard that words crying before but that is sort of meditating on a reflective surface it could be a computer screen or television screen or selective water or a crystal ball or a number of different services but I Know that that is a spiritual and visionary practice that a number of people use\nIn order to you know what what we say reach higher consciousness or um [noise]\nYeah that sounds similar to the kind of practice you're talking about\nWhat Marcia I just wrote down I'm going to give that a try thanks for the suggestion dollar\n[laughter] reading from\nThe idea right east of the Rockies Michael in Connecticut I'm Michael\n... what happened to me is I uh I started writing a dream journal [noise] and I I wrote a dream that my mother's husband who was dead was going to give me his car and almost some money so [noise]\nI didn't believe it was going to happen but it did happen and I'm now driving his car and I got the money to show it was very strange to me that I Dreamed I wrote it down with him with a date on it and everything and it came true like months later [noise]\n[noise] yeah yeah that's right yeah there's a\nThere's a whole technique that Jay W done talks about in his book experiment with time that I talk about in my book about dream journal and how to do it and it sounds like\nYou did that you know you keep a journal there you have a dream you get up you write it down right away and and um people hold journalism and think about your dreams and he believed that you know like you you believe everyone would start having these experiences where they would see these glimpses um glimpses into the future and their dream so that's that's a cool experience\nThank you Michael for sharing a wildcard line Joe in Monterey, California good morning Joe\n[noise] good a good evening George I'm I was about to ask your guest if he ever meditative but I\nThought that it might be better if I introduce another concept to him as a what they call super conscious mind\nI'm not I'm In remote viewing remote viewing has it's drawbacks this is um this is a mental or is this a mental travel or sold travel but it's also in a higher state of Seoul travel a call ... conscious mind and you can access these high of world\nUm I Do this with my clients and uh they go into these different worlds for different reasons weather's healing weather is meet a loved one of the other reasons um it's an extremely um complex\nA multi verse and there's so many different beings how they're doing so much so many different things\nI was wondering if he ever a considered also\nA kind of um higher shelf of remote of writing is a is not like you're writing automatic because not automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation and all it does all you need to do is go\nIt's not automatic writing is really listening to your higher shelf as I call it like taking dictation\nAnd all it does all you need to do is go into like an alpha state or a trans state and just start writing but listening to your thoughts not thinking but listening to what comes to you and after a short time it'll start to come out and you'll be channeling your higher shelf\nYeah yeah I liked that comment because it reminds me of um you know sometimes the ways that people talk about higher dimensions as a as a as a dimension of consciousness right um and and you definitely have this and\nTwenty century psychologist and Carl young ... and many others um you know when we talk about so there'll be in three spatial dimensions to our world and if there was a fourth direction or dimension where would that be some people say well it's going in and you know it's not going out somewhere it's going to end\nThat consciousness sort of um occupies this the sort of a new direction um\nAnd yeah through meditative practices\nI think it is possible to to access those those dimensions if you'd asked if I meditate I Do meditate you know I Do sort of mindfulness meditation and I definitely get into a\nRight into his own where you feel sort of peaceful and quiet and calm I haven't had any visionary experiences while meditating it's much more a\nMuch more mundane unfortunately but um but I Do I Do meditate um and and do some of those practices and in my book I talk about others who have these kind of visionary meditative practices um sounds like what you do\nThanks geopolitical you know you read about a musician and writers who suddenly get inspiration from just out of the blue or do you have written about you know writing yesterday you woke up with it in his hand yeah uh or or other songwriters entire songs already written it came from somewhere else\nYeah and you talked and you talked to scientists about scientific creativity and scientific convention and many scientists while these same kinds of stories some of them will talk about dreams some of them will talk about other forms of inspiration some of them will say that these ideas came from somewhere else and I don't know where they came from\nSome of them will talk about different there's ... there's different layers of consciousness um\nSo I think there's a lot of mystery isn't there\nA Gordon in Lakeland, Florida good morning

these are heavy topics\nBut we have a great guest to help us get our heads around them Christopher white earned a PHD and religious studies from Harvard He's written a brilliant book called other worlds spirituality and the search for invisible dimensions\nWhich takes a look at how our understanding of the world around us and unseen worlds such as the future or heaven or other dimensions have

at least\nI mean I you know different people get difference you know responses from from reading his books but from my perspective I I kind of take the view that is most important um [noise]\nRevelation if you like or conclusion was that many of these phenomena seem to be multi connected if you like into connected and by that you know you have a lot of reports where people have same Bigfoot type creatures on in the same location and timeframe\nA site for example UFO activity I'm the most money point pleasant West Virginia or in the sixties um when there was ... when they ... from the same soaring around the\nThe skies of point pleasant you'll settle a lot of encounters with the men in black and you were following cancer so I think some of these creatures at least some of the the we're the ones like my mind and the dog men and things like that\nI think I'm not even sure that I should fall into the category of crypto zoology will all courageous aching 'cause I'm not entirely sure they are creatures are animals in the way we understand it\nUm you know when you get reports of say a big foot vanishing a flash of light\nOr you know the dog mine roaming around sort of sacred sites and that kind of thing it makes me think that we're dealing with something that's perceived as an animal\nThat night may not be I don't think Kael was I'm someone who is insightful enough way back in the sixties to make these connections but a lot of people\nJust didn't they just turn their heads I just did not want to know or at least didn't want to handle and Dale with the the weirdest sight of these phenomena\nIn this book the book of monsters or several reports early in the book\nThat sort of blend together at least in my head you got ... men go ugh men are we're ... we're cat she chapters are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities 'em or\nSheep gestures are a lot of differences between the these creatures that are seen but also a lot of commonalities um or or is it possible there all the same thing are we talking about something different\n[noise] well I mean it's difficult to say really I mean you know I I don't have any reports at all I should stress where somebody is you know at the turn of the full moon has\nChanged into a Web well from a regular person you know that sort of all the\nThe Hollywood imagery butts the fact is that people do report saying I'm sort of large wolf like animals that seemed to have the ability to walk onto limbs unfold limbs um I've got a lot I get a lot of reports like that but I've I've never gotten reports\nOf someone you know literally\nShape shift the like in you know American way over to London or anything like that\nUm but in a lot of these cases that I Do receive\nWhat I've found is that\nThe the locations where these dog man type creatures have said is intriguing very often these\nAncient burial ... I'm Native American ally and um some of the the the mysterious all mountains in Wisconsin and so on um so I find the fact that they seem to be tied to certain locations is intriguing rather than just saying that random\nYou had one uh where we'll case that was from a military base not ancient either it's more recent times remember them yes\nYeah this was um at a British a bicycle Roy laugh or south and break and are actually was able to speak to the witness personally this case went back to Nineteen Seventy and he was um\nThat to an American guy but it's working I'm overseas it already if I can break in the Nineteen seventies when there were a number of buy shoes which had\nI'm an American presence there she was the height of the Cold War and he he swore that he saw this creature that was like about five to six feet tall covered in ...\nAnd would have sort of kind of look like a big foot type creature was it not for five but just the the face was very different\nTo how you're describing hype and it was more like a lung muzzle with point today is very much like a a German Shepherd so if you imagine sort of big foot body with a with a German shepherds head on it that's pretty much what he described and um [noise]\nYou know I didn't see any reason why he should you know create a story like that will fabricate the story like that he was um I was able to confess I mean it's a background in the middle a tray and he said we just wanted to share the story because they never forgotten about it and it was so it\nYou got a lot of stories in this book instances where people are record these huge dogs I mean right on um how the ... you make that that comparison in your book\nAs well as these gigantic and the you know you can see All right maybe it's an animal scape from the new or maybe somebody's dog that got out in his living wild but these things are seen over centuries over and over again running wild in the u._k. countryside\nAnd some of the encounters have been really dramatic can you share a couple of those start with the the ...\nWell yeah I mean where is it over here you know we have the dog mine which kind of looks like a a dog like animal but it's you know clearly is not\nWell in England or the u._k. we have what are known as find some black dogs now I'm a town of Conan Doyle who wrote the Sherlock Holmes novel hand or the ... he actually vice his novel on uh\nConan Arthur Conan Doyle who wrote a Sherlock Holmes novel harm to the ... he actually ... his novel on a pre existing legend\nI'm of one of these many black dog stories that you can find in the u._k. um back typically I'm much ... much larger than regular dogs are like a fiery blazing red eyes\nAnd in a lot of the elections and traditions if you would just say one of the base um find some black dogs would automate that you would die or a close family member or friend would die\nI'm ... and like the dog my entire often sane at the same places like um crossroads graveyards um places like that in moderation is I've got several\nUm reports of people saying the fountain black dogs in the vicinity of stone circles in the ... not at Stonehenge which is obviously the most famous one but the you know there are many many um smaller\nUm formations around the a K and I've got two cases from Scotland where witnesses so one of these large black dogs ... and like they okay she's going back centuries the dog was that one second and then quite literally gum and ... you know just vanished into nothing\nUm and again it's hard to determine what these things are you know ... not normal dogs I mean all the spirits of\nDogs that once lived um I guess the only downside with that is that much bigger than regular dogs you know you'd imagine a fight with the\nSpirits of of that dogs would resemble the dogs they looked like in real life I'm ...\nAnd then the cats are even harder to explain in the u._k. I mean there's no big cat lived there well now you write\nIn fact they become known as ... face I Am big cats\nAnd again every year we get dozens and dozens of reports of papal saying large black cats robbing the K now the occasional sort of ask I ask I pay you know from a zoo menagerie whatever might explain a couple of cases\nAnd you know there are cases where\nI'm wild animals actually have a guy from shows but I've always been rounded up very very quickly the problem is there\nAre these large black cats roaming around the ... which simply defy explanation because the sheer number of reports from the bottom of England to the top of the top of Scotland these hundreds every year now\nFor that many reports to exist you know there must be anti colonies are these creatures roaming around that is a ... a flesh and blood regular animals which not every researcher the phenomenon thinks that's the case\nYou know what we're going to get into some of the more exotic explanations in a moment talking with Nick red burn about is the monster book creatures beach and beans of nature of this could\nAnd this was a particularly weird case but what was intriguing about it was it was taken very seriously by the local news pipe for the ... post and somebody it's saying this um\nWhat looked like a humanoid figure sort of literally flying or a soaring would be a better term to use out of the woods I'm at a high speed um you know kind of a\nLike a flying man I'm not unlike I guess they you know the stories coming out of ... places\nIn the sixties or with a ... something you know it kind of power outage in that respect and there were there were a number of independent witnesses who came forward and spoke to the press one of them spoke to the local police or I don't really know what the police could have done about it but it's um [noise]\nBut it was intriguing that you know you have the spy too weird activity in this area which he's all ready notorious for sightings of things interesting enough light the dog man and ah the\nFind some black dogs and also the large black cats as well\nYou have a story or in the book about the terror you call it the terrible old man thing Nineteen Seventy seven that services and the ... of all places in Sunnyvale, California\n[noise] oh yeah that that's really crazy story I guess appropriate for um Halloween and there's a story I gave it to me by a lady named Terri and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with well I can only call like a man named black and not the ...\nNine cherry and she had the ... in Nineteen Seventy seven with what I can only called like a mom in black and not many black as that put portrayed by Will Smith and told me late Jones in the movies\nBut the real men in black and much way it is I sort of very ... and don't look entirely human by sort of almost look ... and ... like a lot of power normal overtones attached to the rail many black stories you know\nWhereas in the movies that some secret agents you know all the secret agency but Terry telling me the story of times Nineteen Seventy seven when she was just a a young girl at the time she was having lunch with a friend\nAnd they create demanding black time towards them sat down\nAnd proceeded to tell Terry I'm basically to the future of the the rest of her life\nAnd it was filled with sort of doom and gloom and tragedy and she said that just looking at him was like looking it's somebody who was dead and almost led demonic was ... was that sort of terminology\nAnd um it was sort of penetrating eyes this old black suits and just gave off this really I'm sort of intimidating creepy vibe and didn't really come across as being completely human\nDidn't something I mean the thing is that this guy said was going to happen to her I think they they did happen to her\nOr yes that's right so she got a lot of tragedy in a life and the kind of\nFolk after that to happen and um I think when it happened as a teenager you know she she never re for garbage or last ditch and I think you know to have that sort of trauma hanging over here for the rest of your life you know believing that's\nWhat this mindset or things said I'm gonna come true you know I mean you could understand how it would create a great deal of stress for someone\nYou know the man's stories at least the movie version of more men is that this creature years\nDifferent forms the different people different times but it's a harbinger of doomed to come and it predates bad things that are about to happen is that sort of how you think ... you you know plays out in the men's I use a pleasant and beyond\nWell yeah I mean there's no doubt it's um you know when you look at them off my story that it sort of saturated in weirdness and tragedy for people who don't know it kicked off and light sixty six important players in West Virginia\nI when people started seeing this creature that some people described as like a flying humanoid a few people said it looked vaguely like a terrorist act so others described as a giant bud\nAnd um but whatever that was seeing people would play that I Would say something way bigger than any normal but bad or anything like that\nAnd when the scientists that hides in sixty seven you had a lot of we had a UFO activity\nUm the surfacing of this weird creepy character named injured cold it was like approach on

whether it is wishful thinking the part of people who follow this stuff and we should what happened or\nWhether this credibility to those sightings what's your take on it\nWell you know you do get strange creatures waves in the field of crypto zoology you know a lot they as you mentioned the the ... just said in Chicago last summer\nUm and we get kind of spite so or waves of activity in

know the the ... and then suddenly those you know a two week period we get a lot of things like that\nAnd um that kind of I'm I'm really feel like he's sort of power leveled throughout various other types of of creatures so again I'm inclined to think that may be\nYou know something that suggests again a connection between these creatures even though they perceived as being very difference of course but uh but that that way of activity in um Chicago last year it was very interested\nFor my own perspective although I didn't really investigate the ... because um there are a lot of people um who are already looking into each one of them a friend of mine Alison John Lennon shaving two and a lot of good research into it but what I did I wrote a couple of articles about aids\nAnd it ... to

middle of the creatures and things like that it's also about candy Montrose rock kid at least I think that sounds about candy\nYou know we were talking with their red burned in the first hour about the men in black how the story of legend has been transformed by Hollywood\nInto something very different from what the witnesses have described over the decades and there was a scene in one of those and why be movies where the it'd be actors by can be very humid agents mentioned how all the real news all the good stories get reported first in the tabloids\nSort of hitting that that the agents and agencies are the ones who leak or plant crazy wild stories about the paranormal\nGive them to say the weekly world news it's kind of funny stuff but is it true or could there be agencies government entities that tried to influence public perception of these topics monitor the subjects watch and spy on those who've had experiences listen to the phones roam around messed with their heads\nThe answer is yes and the red burners put together a new project it pulls together far flung examples and government documents to make the case that it's true it's called top secret alien abduction ... and that's what we're going to talk about in this hour we'll be right back [noise]\nIs that a justification for going around people like a dam ski bathroom those books\nOh yeah because I mean Georgia ... is a first book flying saucers and landed published in the early fifties that that sold in huge figures are gigantic numbers of books with salt I'm On and a a ... he went on the lecture circuits are all around the country\nAnd he was talking about how they and supposedly have this sort of a communist type of governments on the communism was the way the future\nAnd the FBI open that file on it down skate um predominantly because he was someone yes talking about a controversial subject namely UFOs and contact with highly ands or buts\nThe FBI was more concerned as to how painful reading these books and go into his lectures might be influenced by vase communist angle and I'm a number of the the contact chase I've sort of similar approaches for example again in the ...\nUh you have the of the area society created by George king that was closely watched\n'em by the British a police force because I'm George King various society but very much I'm On the nuclear weapons and so far\nBecause I'm George King ... theory a society we're very much I'm On the nuclear weapons and so falls were opened on them so in other words you actually have files opened on the contact cheese\nBut predominantly because they have these political slums or in many of claims but at the pool and the gaze\nAt the end of the day what it boils down to the FBI and the other agencies were opening surveillance files on people who claimed close encounters um with non human entities\nYou report in the book that's coming out first of November 'em up secret alien abduction while you were something that I had read before the ...\nOr ... ... the the this is an abduction cases in which the guy had reported that he had sex with an alien female and uh I'd never heard this new explanation but it takes government surveillance two older level still that story\nWell yeah this this is a strange one I mean the the conventional aspect if you can call it a conventional um aspects of the story goes back to the fifties and he's a famous case uh from Brazil where this young man named Antonio village ...\nClaim to being taken on board a UFO and as you said he had sex with this beautiful looking um alien woman\nAnd I'm I'm ... sense of purpose if he was taken on board against his will so he was abducted you know it was an abduction case\nUm we didn't you follow gee you know it's either perceived as being a wishful thinking on the part of Sonia ... was\nAll you know it was a really weird aspects of the phenomena and\nNow there's this little I'm known aspects of the story a which place is an entirely different slant on it until\nNow if you read carefully Antonio spouses a report that he put together for um a Brazilian a UFO researching a doctor named a lot of fun says\nUm he talks about how the craft that he was taken on board um came down and he started to feel weird as if he'd been drug somehow and he said he was taken aboard this craft which he described as being sort of long rectangular\nAnd um he had like something on TALK like a dish that was spinning around very fast\nAnd he was making the Beijing noise\nNow that's kind of sounds not unlike a helicopter you know the shape\nThey the spinning disk on top of the roses and debate to noise\nSays like the classic sound you get with a helicopter\nNow among came forward um in the late Nineteen seventies but he's still didn't get very much a publicity is nine was Bosco metal ... and he had ties to the CIA and various other agencies\nAnd um he told the race a year for research rich Reynolds of what he said was the real story namely that um the the abduction was a fabrication\nAnd that's ... but he really did evolve a helicopter but they targeted um ... hours he was out to the ... working in the field lights at night\nUm they release some sort of average ... aerosol er which incapacitated in Tokyo on board the helicopter and the the a woman was really bad and the pot was played out um but he is in a sort of an altered states wasn't sure what\nThe woman was really that on the part was played out um but he is in a sort of an old two states wasn't sure what was going on and that was then soda and ceremony asleep dumped back on the ground\nAnd they the favorite of the story was that's the agencies within governments\nThat might well a vein rail abductions but they were also fabricating abductions to try and determine how bad Monday through the fifties while the CIA eyes and ... and things like they say the plan was to try and determine to what extent\nThe human mind to be altered and you know in other words if we can convince people that I can say highly ... we can convince them of anything that\nWas basically what it came down to so metal ... claim that um\n[noise] but they they the abduction if you like was played out\nAnd buy kind of just then sat back and white to to say how much of the story was taken in and when I realized that the story of being embraced by you follow Jay and it was a parenting books it was the case of a job well done and\nMakes you wonder you know you have several examples of these are pretty well documented abduction cases where the um the principal Oregon think that it's something beyond just some alien presents there's military or government involvement\nYeah I mean they should where it gets confusing if they're you know throughout January and I didn't have adoptions and then you have agencies fabricating them to try and determine how the human mind\nCan be altered and they use the UFO angle is the most have to try and you know I'm just see how it works on people doesn't with so you know it gets really confusing when that could be rail abductions and fabricated ones as well\nIt makes you wonder I mean is it possible there are agencies that are investigating the abductees messing with them a following them around listening to the phones but not investigating the abductions themselves nominate soap or are they doing both and just not feeling\nWell I think there's good evidence that it's um it's actually both because some of the duct tape that I spoke with\nSaid that they don't have a number of occasions I'd actually being visited by military personnel and it wasn't like a a traumatic threatening at my base situation it was more of these military personnel were actually approach and be able to taste quietly\nRequesting that they didn't talk about their experiences and some of them didn't some some of them have\nBut they basically they ... it was as if the military were asking questions um along the lines of well can you give us some insight as to why this is being done so in other words they were trying to get to the hearts of what the abductions where why that were being done\nBut in other cases there is good evidence also of um surveillance of the of the outlook pays a good example\nOn somebody um who is tied to coast to coast I'm Greg bishops I'm Greg tell me how um he had a a period of correspondence in the Nineteen uh ninety's a duck to college or who wrote a number of good books on abductions and she was an ap duct tape herself\nOn Greg told me how you know back in the early nineties you know sort of pre Internet here um all of the ... I wrote to each other back and forth\nWere opened an sailed back down with type and um now these can clearly be done you know a family without making it look like the ... I was taught to want to open a race failed it was all about\nAnd um now these can clearly be done you know age late without making it look like I was growing up for re failed it was almost as if\nIt was based on Greg in college and it's a note that someone was opening their mail in other words he was sort of like an intimidation hey you know we're watching it\nAnd that went on you know for for quite a period\nA Greg is working tonight as our Web master by the way so uh yeah I I saw his name I was going to mention that in the book and ask you about it\nI mean there are a lot of people in the UFO field who you know um are not as credible as Greg who are sure that the government's watching him I'm and I'm not sure I Believe all of them I Believe him though he says it and you\nKnow I think sometimes you know there's no doubt if you have a traumatic experience like an abduction and I think sometimes paypal can become sort of\nParanoid of every little thing in their life you know I'm with you again just wrote you go down um but in shame that I mean another example is the whole issue of black helicopters which I think many people associate with cafeteria to ice shows\nI'll tell you what network let's wait a second we'll get into that on the other side of save some time so people can ask you a couple of questions but we got some other ground to cover before then or we're going to go into the break with a deep purple demons eyes and making Seventy one [noise]\nI Can't imagine what the total dollar amount of\nLosses for all the livestock losses for ranchers and farmers could be but it's pretty substantial\nAnd when you look at how the government has responded the FBI\nHad some ... agents who looked at it a very cursory examination investigation that really didn't get to the bottom of it and then nothing so what do you make of that and in combined with the the black helicopter phenomena that you discuss in this book\nWell I think you know the the black helicopter phenomena and um it's clearly a real one and it does seem to be tied to both ... and um [noise] the Eileen abduction phenomena and\nOne of the things such as being notation I think there's probably some truth to this is the idea that these whoever's flying these helicopters potentially I think is part of an organization that up right\nOutside of government you know it may actually it may sort of do research and work for the government\nBut it's not you know like the CIA or anybody like that fly helicopters I don't think\nI think it is sort of um you know almost like a like a black budget ... kind of program designed to do the work and in most faith in government don't know anything about it at all because it might not actually operate under the regular confines of the government\nItself you know it may have paid even sort of farmed out to private corporations which again would make it more difficult to get material for the fate of Information Act when you're dealing with private corporations which aren't covered by ah by the fate of information request\nSo in that sense I think you know the the phenomenon and Israel and I think whether it's ... or abductions\nThe Gulf seems to base of islands to try and figure out what's going on you know there there's so many cases are black helicopters and other ... helicopters\nTurning up near the homes sometime precariously there the homes of a duct tape and and again kind of light with college entering Greg\nBase might be a degree of um intimidation but also it might be an attempt to just keep an eye on the abduct taste um\nAnd be able to to respond at high speed if it in the event that they have the papal flying cops his were actually able to catch an ad abduction going ahead you know in the sense of that very time\nSomebody who's tuning in tonight for the first time has to think we're all crazy alien abductions kennel mutilation black helicopters and we're saying yeah this happens\nBut the files that you've obtain from US government from the u._k. government sheds light on these things and someone takes it seriously maybe the scariest part of this is\nThat there isn't anyone who really knows what's going on in their agencies different agencies and government small groups of people who are looking at this but really don't have answers about\nWho's responsible and why this stuff happens\nWell yeah I mean that that that's a good point George because\nLooking at this but really don't have answers about who's responsible and why this happens\nWell yeah I mean that that's a good point George because I mean government agencies don't always know what another agency knows a you know many many cases agencies\nHave the information to themselves unless it needs to be shed and if we'd dealing with as I said a group that actually isn't technically part of the government but the works farmed out to a private companies and things like that that's going to make it even more\nDifficult but I mean in terms of the files on the um on the black helicopters I've probably got about three or four hundred pages I'm so that that includes the FBI stay classified files on Capitol mutations\nI'm a wave of and cancers that occurred in Seventy five and some of the the ... and I'm bored of the United states and in the last ... Seventy five\nAnd I'm just various other case it including some from the ... when there was a wave of activity of UFOs in Seventy three and there was also a wave of black helicopters in the same areas\nSo I think we're seeing a pot and on and I think the violence and intimidation of sort of the the mine coal and caused the you know I'm explain why they're flying around\nYou know trying to figure out what's going on with these abductees experiences on literally physically real or not it it's tough to even though there are some really well documented it's tough to figure it out it's not what\nSomeone else is looking for when they put people through this stuff you mentioned you bring up bombs are in the in the book\nAnd I should mention that there was a film coming out about those are new to you the thirtieth anniversary of when that story first came out the jury because it's got to come out in December and then there's a book that's going to be published a I think after the first year\nAnd a lot of interest in the case but your angle was kind of an interesting one on one how it fits into the whole abductee aliens scenario\n[noise] well yeah I mean you know was our stories always intrigued me I Know a lot of people dismiss you are right but one of the things I've always found about ... saw is unlike a lot of people who hoax things\nThat you follow gee you know when this story runs out of feel um you know they suddenly out a new angle to it so they can get back on the lecture circuit and so on\nUm you know they are and I think the big difference we'd lives are is he never embroidered on the ... the original story be told as it was never expanded on it he tells the same stories at eight Thirty years ago\nHe hardly try to put himself at the forefront of you follow Jay and you know polling and\nHowever many you know dollars and so forth he doesn't you know regardless of the the controversial nature of the story it doesn't come across like your average hoax so that's one of the thing that's always intrigued me but um you know the in relation to the book I talk about the connections\nAre between the abductions\nAnd people who claimed that in some way or another they the the graze the Iranian Gray's who\nSomehow they have this date and sort of sinister and disturbing entrenched in the human soul 'em and they sort of ties in with ... when he claimed that um it was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and ask for this this portion of very fifty while he was working at a legit\nBy him that's um he was given a bunch of a briefing papers to read out and asked for this week's portion of very fifty while he was working at the legislature and um\nHe said that was the the Iranians or whatever they are viewed us as containers and um and he speculates on the possibility of containers of cells in other words if the graves had some sort of\nObsessive interesting in the human cell on one of the things I talk about in the book is\nI'm a number of abduct Hayes who were approached climbed dastardly by these military agencies\nAre private corporations I'm Still asked questions about you know did you have any dreams afterwards if you bought a veal salt leaving your body um did\nYou have any sort of like a religious confession after the abduction thing really weird questions but some of the questions kind of do\nChild wave this story that was always telling as well\nKnow you you look at recent developments in regard to UFO topic in general\nAnd and of course we've been told since Nineteen sixty nine the U.S military the air force and they stopped project ... book they're not studying it it's no threat to national security we don't care we're not looking at it and now of course you know I don't know that anyone ever really believed that but\nThat was the cover story and and now we've learned the last ten months that wasn't true but there were ongoing studies that were more than one in fact that they were collecting information on what seems like you know presumably is ridiculous\nUm in light of the kind of a while that you bring up in this book where there's surveillance and there's counter intelligence and there's um you know just information and things that sort\nOr do you have concerns about the recent revelation I I I Would think that people who are suspicious sooner wary of this you know they there's some history behind why they need to be careful\n[noise] well yeah I mean I think you know it is such a confusing angle George you know this this angle of um rail abductions fabricated abductions the violence the government itself trying to get its had around what's going on\nYou know you put all this together and um you know ... it really is sort of a difficult area which to work to try and figure out you know watch true what isn't so\nOr is it somewhere between the two you know and um\nAgain that's why you know went on the way I've written a book is to demonstrate what we know the says you know what we speculate as to why the government or an agency might be doing this why might they be fabricating\nAnd abduction events but then at the same time also investigating legitimate events\nYou know it's it's it's not ... now where um you know being a just black and white you know it it's the the lines are really blood in trying to figure out what the overall goal is", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "29"}
