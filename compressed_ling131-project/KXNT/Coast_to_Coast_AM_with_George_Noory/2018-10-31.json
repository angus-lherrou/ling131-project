fascinated I don't know if you looked at ... electronic voice phenomenon\nWhere the whole chapter in the book about ... percent perfect\nBecause it seems to me that since we've gone to the digital age from the analog age you're getting more and more these recordings\nYes indeed and I think that what you have is you have the ability now to use\nDigital radios to scan the frequencies more quickly\nA fellow by the name of Frank ... in the nineties figured out that if you hack a digital FM radio you can literally break it in such a way so that does that scans the frequency is it doesn't stop at a station\nWhen the signal comes in clear it just continually sweeps and again that that's that continuous sweeping has you'll ... if you do that voices and other sounds sort of a rise out of that and noise\nAnd again people will write these words down that they will\nCapture and these very quick sparse moment says it scans the frequencies and see if they can have some or attempt to have some kind of communication with with a imagine as the spirit world\nHe came up with one of his cold springs box which is throwing the exactly that isn't it that's\nRight Frank's box and you can see some of the photographs online if he's a really wonderful very creative um devices that he made and he they became more and more complex he'll eventually he started to think that maybe in fact it wasn't spirits at all but that it was he was communicating with extraterrestrials\nPeter as you were putting together strange frequencies did you come across anything strange yourself\nWhile I did some experiments and there were a few times where there were a few things that I thought were particularly odd but I think what was important was that I was able to sort of get into that had space where I felt that I was doing something that had been\nBeing done for centuries I mean I'm I'm would like to make the argument that even somebody like John de who was using his scenes stones to try to communicate with the angels and ... and as a result created what magicians called the ... language\nThat that use of a scene stone is the same as using radio to communicate with the sphere world that\nThat this is something that human beings have been attempting to do with some media mystic device some material device\nWhere we take something and we read purpose that we use it in a way that it wasn't originally intended\nAnd in fact the magician or the medium becomes a kind of spiritual hacker\nWhere we're really trying to interact with our technologies and the material world in a way that some would say really is that what we're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know what's really the hackers that have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for that\nWe're supposed to be doing with it and yet as we know it's really the hackers that have work early on the most inventive and if it wasn't for the hackers would probably wouldn't have desktop computers today in our home\n[laughter] that's true you to be with us his latest book is called strange frequencies you start the book with Jewish mythology and legends rumbling the goal and tell us about that\n[noise] yeah I mean I like to think that the goal of them is really the first piece of technology right where we try to build something and and view it with a spiritual\nPower and use it to some and what's interesting about the Golan legend is the legend of the goal them as it's called particularly the goal of Prague is a story of a rabbi who builds\nA goal and to help the Jewish people who feel um we're being attacked or there's a whole rum and they're trying to defend themselves\nAnd eventually the goal and becomes\nIt goes you know it it it it it there's chaos ensues the rabbi can no longer control it and either has to destroy it already has to put it to sleep\nIn one of the stories that goal and gross so large that the rabbi has to climb up on a ladder and a race the secret word from its forehead and it crumbles into dust sometimes crushing the rabbi and some of the stories but if you look at the actual\nJewish ... missed this as a mystical writings about the call them the goal of them is in some ways a\nA means by which the the rabbi demonstrates their spiritual\n... it's it's almost like a test to show that they are prepared for greater mystical magical knowledge\nBut the goal in itself is was understood by the rabbis to be just kind of a dumb machine here's a wonderful ... story where a rabbi ... go to the head rabbi and\nThey show him the goal them and the says to them well what can I Do kind of speak and they say well no it can't speak and he says well then what good is it it's just it's just the toy\n[laughter] which is what really makes the human being different from all the other creatures right so we can't do that we're not playing God we might think we are but if we can't do that then we're just pretended to the throne as it were\nYou know what about the showman you well you know you need a ... American tradition and other types of was a cultures ... seemed to be the person connected to the other side\n[noise] that's right and the Sherman would also used in utilize\nSound and light off and and other kinds of mechanisms to try to induce the states have consciousness in their people and I think that what the ... and what the stage magician does in many ways this is very connected and it also\nConnects us and connects the technology to the history of spiritualism and the staging of spiritualism which spirit cabinets and the different ways in which people were using technologies sometimes it was just a little lever inside the cabinet\nBut they were using technologies to be able to create the state\nOf consciousness in the audience and so I don't think that it's necessarily well we we don't go to see a magic trick and get mad that were being tricked right we want to be we want to be and chanted we want to exist in that state of mind\nAnd so all the ways in which people have used technology whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we've long been excited about it I mean even\nGee whether it's very primitive are very advance I think it's something that we've long and excited about it I mean even watching a film about spirits in the movie theater is almost like a ... that sure experiences knit\nThomas Edison the great inventor was obsessed with trying to communicate with the other side he tried to build his own machine I don't think he was never able to do it was you\nKnow and and in fact you know he really wanted it to be true in this even goes back to the ways in which we have very interesting thing here where we have people who are considered scientists the rational it\nAnd it's not that they were the funky because they want it to just be cynical skeptical because they really want that there to be the truth this is true of Houdini\nHoudini really want it to him he really wanted to find a medium who could communicate with the other side so that he might speak with his ear departed mother\nBut he couldn't find on all he found was Charlotte but his but he believed that it could be possible and I think that that's an important thing that sometimes we we lose a sense of that mystery in our lives where\nLet's just for a moment pretend even if it's just a pretend moment imagine that these things could be possible I think that that's a valuable place sometimes just sit still for a while with ourselves\nInto those Houdini by the way you write was obsessed with trying to find out about the other side we're talking about him in a couple of hours after we're done talking on the right yes that's right ... going to be exciting he's he was one heck of a guy but as you say he wasn't able to find the medium to do the job\nThat's right if he had two days equipment do you think he might be able to do something\n[laughter] maybe but I think that he would also find which unfortunately I sometimes found is that people were\nUsing these things but if you sort of you to move the curtain aside you saw the wizard of Oz there with all his contraption think is most quickly try to hide the fact that maybe he really was it is magical as you thought\nWere going to be back in a moment to talk more with Peter a beeper goal his book strange frequencies we've got a link to his publisher Random House to make it easy for you to get the book if you're into this it's a magnificent story the subtitle is the extraordinary story of the technological quest\nFor the super natural ... stick with us we're going to take calls with Peter next hour well even take your stories you're paranormal stories and just your general questions more to talk with him about though about strange frequencies high technology in its ability to maybe communicate with the other side\nPeter of all these incredible inventors and engineers in seekers who are temping attempting to get some kind of evidence about the existence of the other side what do you think drove them why would they so obsessed with trying to get these answers\nI think what Dr fat quest is what drives a very human quest to take control of our own\n... material death that I mean it it I think it's actually a very American Spirit right I mean that some scholars a sociologist one particular ... used to talk about you know Protestantism and the spirit of capitalism that\nSomething about the Protestant American beer and it's something whereby we want to\nProve our righteousness we want to prove that we are loved by God by\nBy being successful in the world by being innovators inventors entrepreneur is right and I think that that extends even to our sense of our own spirituality and that this idea that we are in charge of our own salvation\nWhere we want to be right in front of our experience with the divine\nIs is again something that's very human I think typically American off and\nAnd so you have these people who are just doing what we've always wanted to do which is to say you know what I'm gonna do it I'm going to figure out how to interact with with spirit or with God or divine or whatever\nAnd and how do we do that well we often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose\nThey often do that by inventing something by making something by taking something that pre existing eye opening it up and re purpose in it\nAnd so I think that that drive is is a is a very human drive it's why people have practiced magic for millennium right just another example of magic of a\nOf a cult practice where we are trying to insert ourselves between\nRight right in the middle to get right in there and to say I want to have this experience directly I don't want it to be mediated but if it is going to be mediated I'm going to be the one who who uses that tool\nI could we put you Peter in that category\nMyself yeah well I definitely am somebody who who believes in a spiritual reality and who wants to interact with that um I tend to ah believe though that\nWe have to be careful about how much we try to rest that you know from it that we have to post put it this way we have to meet God halfway right we can't make it all the way [laughter] you know and if we get so far and we don't get an answer then maybe there wasn't an answer at that moment for us to get\nWhy does it seem that some people get the answer or at least they think they do and then others can't even get close\n[noise] yeah I mean that's the greatest that's the greatest mystery though isn't it I mean there is you know why some people seem to be more sensitive to this or why some people are like this goes you know back to\nThe whole idea that we once used to think that a that a profit was somebody who had special information for us and now we often believe that those people might actually be crazy right so you know it's a for a long time we've been wrestling with the visionary experience and\nUm and that's why you know even people who produce art that we called visionary art or spiritual arts are often considered outsider artists why is that why are the people who are working with these themes consider to be outside artist as opposed to just people who are part of a regular\nAre mainstream artistic community and I think it's we live in a world where we still feel that these questions have to be a little bit on the outside of our normal experience and what's interesting about technology is that it and this is really key here to see if I can explain this\nSomebody takes her radio\nAnd they say I'm gonna I'm gonna open up this radio when I'm when I re solder a few connections to see if I can communicate with the spirit world\nBut the science that made that radio possible and the science that makes it possible to the Saudi Arabia and have another effect hate plays\nThe science behind that that even made this radio or something that you could find a store which said that communication with the spirit world is not possible spirits don't it yes and yet we can take the thing this technology and somehow divorced it from the science that\nIs underneath the scientific method in scientific understanding of the world it's it's underneath it and\nDivorced and turned it into a tool that we can use to try to have these experiences and so I think there's a fascinating disconnect there about how we can think about technologies in ways that the science connected to them might actually be in opposition to\nWell you didn't know the radio or have a computer where you can listen online and somebody came up to you Peter\nWell if you didn't own a radio or have a computer where you could listen on line and somebody came up to you and said Peter I hear voices of this guy at night\nTalking about ghosts and spirits and all these strange things he's out there he's out there and you of course we never had a radio you never went on line like that to listen you're probably saying what's this guy talking about he's insane or but my voice is out there and it's being heard by millions\nOr if they have the receiver to pick it up in in I think all we need in order to pick up the spirit world which is all energy to use the right time to receiver\n[noise] well it's fascinating that you say that because when\nSpiritual is that it was becoming very popular I'm In the Eighteen hundreds in the mid to late Eighteen hundreds it was also when we had started developed ... telegraph technology and people called medium spiritual mediums\nSpiritual telegraph [laughter] they really believe that there was this link between this\nThis new burgeoning technology and how you're right it was a special a new kind of receiver and transmit are and that the human being could also be this thing and so we use that same language to talk about them\nYou see that being from the television Iraq has really augmented in shape things were spirituality in technology and tell me why\nWhile I mean the TV itself is kind of a ... very strange and scary yeah it is the some of the the there's a very wonderful advertisement from a television set in Nineteen thirty four called the clue television company\nAnd they actually ate it says how they advertised on TV this is what they said the dreams of witches have come true oh my God\nSo they they saw this thing this new device that the way to capture the public's imagination about buying this thing was not to try to make it less weird\nBut to increase its sense of being connected to some supernatural dream that we once had that we could communicate in this way over the ether right\nUm and so the the fact that you know we that we used to call those the after effects on a TV you know in that when we were used to watch you ate shepherd VHS stations with an antenna\nWe used to call those dose right so even the way in which we think about the television metaphorically is is filled to the Bram right with these supernatural and I called metaphors and I think that that's really important I think it even when we talk about technology for not believers and even if we're just\nUsing it we still use these this language to try to make sense of it\nAnd I remember those days to dump that this has anything to do with our discussion tonight but a ... radios televisions were built into very heavy furniture remember those\nOh my gosh yeah absolutely\nYep my dad had an old silk all radio and this thing must have been about four feet tall and you know where it was it was in case in this beautiful piece of wood furniture and had silver co written across it\nUh it ... it was it was a piece of art in the same way or the TVs in the in the stereo suddenly started coming out with\nFact is meant to be central pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like pulp guys comes out it only makes sense\nThere are pieces of our home right and so you can imagine this thing the centerpiece of our home and then a movie like pope guys comes out it only makes sense that this is how the spirits would come into our lives is through the TV\nAre you a hundred percent convinced Peter that the other side exists\nI'm not a hundred per cent convinced about anything so I you know I live\nIn a very limited all place what I what I like more than anything and what I liked about is about technology is that I really believe that these ambiguous states\nAre in chanting steak it when somebody tries to convince me something as a hundred percent true I tend to be a lot more skeptical\nThan somebody who just wants to share an interesting experience with me\nGet into your time machine and tell me what you think things will be like fifty years from now with regard to trying to communicate with the other side\n[laughter] well let's talk more about um maybe it's not that we will communicate with the other side but we will have transcended to the other side by use of artificial intelligence upload in our consciousness to computers\nGuard we are always ready\nSponsored by the Army National guard they're talking about a broadcasters

remember that\nNo but I Love it all happened um that these miracles happened over the television\nYeah that's true [laughter] that's absolutely true technology at its best right somebody's going to come up with something somewhere I think don't you\nI mean some you know we can only become more advanced and it's going to be interesting to see if one day these different parts of our lives can really merge in some way and maybe it's technology that's going to make that possible\nLet's go to Carolyn are hemmed in Connecticut now Hi Carol thanks for calling\nHi uh maybe you haven't had any

boy say don't drive that way\nNo one no one has any access to my CDs my anything and I'm looking around all of a thing where it's coming from is coming from the thing and it never happened again I

pretty pretty soon it'll be popping up on podcasts Peter\n[laughter] that's right exactly what goes\nTo the whole range of electronic Bush phenomenon I mean the earliest researchers weren't using radios they were using white noise\nThey were using just a quiet room with a microphone it was it wasn't so much about the that the vice itself it was the fact that the it was electronic media it was making this possible some record label media whether it was a tape\n'em or in this case a CD\nWell in one one of the things I think that is very intriguing about all of this is that some people do not react to that little angels shooting on their shoulder whispering in their year telling them don't do this or move here go straight stop\nYou have to be able to\nDetermine when to do these things right mhm because if you don't you could miss a great opportunity or you could get killed or something like that and put out\nAbsolutely and how do you know maybe in some ways and and I don't mean to diminish anybody's experienced that maybe you know maybe sometimes we project\nThese things from within ourselves on to the media you know maybe it's not the spirit world communicating to us with the with the um radio what the tape player maybe it's our own unconscious\nOur own spirits that are trying to communicate something to watch that we need to hear\nWhen you started writing the book strange frequencies was an easy or difficult for you to get it started\n[noise] well part of the problem for me was is that each one of the subjects that I took up there's been you know decades of research and books about them so\nWhat I Would have to try to figure out a way to do is take all of this material and and turned it into what I think I Hope is interesting stories about these these specific things I mean the history of there's some wonderful books about the history of spare photography\nBut I wanted to specifically orient my story around Shannon's work and in doing so take up you know some of the important background information\nBut yes it ... it was difficult and I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand that that [noise]\nHorton background information but yes it ... it was difficult and I have to say and and you know I'm sure that you understand that that no matter how you want to approach the subjects whether you want approached a skeptic or as a full on believer or the way that I liked to approach the more as a journalist and historian\nThat people are worried when you bring up or it's like ... for natural are caught they don't know if you're going to try to exploit them or make fun of them or\nIf you're coming at it from a way that it was is not rational enough you know and so just the idea that I wanted to work with these subjects at all poses problems sometimes when I'm asking interview somebody and they're\nA little bit mistrust sure my intentions might be\nWell in a lot of people Peter when they hear the word a cult thing because it's

... here for you as they continue rolling in Joe in the Bronx age oh go ahead\nAnd do it all is well good yeah\nA theater you mentioned earlier that you didn't think the spirits possessed vocal cords so I had an experience or when my brother visited me or\nIf the is the way I'm\nNot immediately if he passed away but several years later I'm I was having read his blog I'm a singer songwriter um and I was stuck on a a song without uh any uh you know a inspiration coming to me\nAt the moment and it was during the day and he ... he walked past what am I did\nAnd he said just get it done so at that but what you're saying that uh they don't possess a way to generate their own voices that that's why they're using technology than hell was that was generated\n... yeah I mean that's just another experience I mean I I don't say that I was I was commenting on what people who are based on what a Jew and it said that VP\nYeah I mean that's just another experience I mean I I don't say that I was I was commenting on what people who are based on what a Jew and had said that even the pie researchers might respond to her idea\nThat indeed there couldn't be voices but certainly our experience is one which thousands and thousands of people throughout history and had\nYou know and I got to tell you that you know since people have been investigating goals and haunting from the other side to show many years do you find that these sightings are more prevalent now or are the less than before [noise] [noise] well\nI think it feels more prevalent because we have access to information that um you know so quickly so I think everything feels like it's more because you can hear about it more more often but certainly there is an increase in general I think in an interest in\nUm alternative spirituality you know I'm you know there's a huge increase in interest in Wicca and Neal paganism right now I'm a lots of people who are experimenting and reading about and writing about witchcraft\nUm so I just think that overall there's an increase in people's needs to be seeking\nUm some alternative ways of thinking about a spiritual experience but I Do think that we just live in an age where you know information is just overload enough and so certainly it feels like there's more but I think that either experience as a human being says and having as long as we've been we've been on the earth\nIs going to Anthony in Asheville North Carolina first time caller for a sigh Anthony\nHi George thanks for taking my call thank you for your service though and they'd be better at

moment are very special guest professor of slim king joins us\nTo talk about Harry Houdini for a moment Harry Houdini was the Hungarian born American illusion is stumped performer noted for\nHis sensational escape back she first attracted notice of vaudeville and the U.S and that is Harry ... on a tour of Europe where he challenged police forces to keep him locked up\nSunni extended his repertoire to include chains ropes slung from\nSkyscrapers straight jackets underwater and having to escape from an old his breath and sort of sealed milk in the water in Nineteen all for thousands watched as he tried to escape from special ... cups commissioned by London daily mirror keeping him and suspense for an hour\nAnd another stunts buried alive only just able to claw himself to the surface or merge you know the state of near break down\nNow what many suspected that these escapes were faked Houdini presented himself as a scourge are fake spiritual is he was obsessed with trying to communicate with his dead mother and went through all kinds of mediums and people to find her he was not successful\nOr you know died from this punch a lot of doctors nowadays say he just died at ... night is\nFrom a panics\nSo it's the battles rage on and on and what really killed him and it goes back and forth but I think he was had the onset of a appendicitis and that when he was hit it actually broke\nBoston all the bacteria comes out and rent money\nRight and they had no anti bacterial anything back then in twenty six so he uh had took him seven days to die\nWho substances that what happened yes yeah it was a\nParrot might so it substance all through they had two operations\nAnd then they gave him some mysterious fear that they'd been working on but nothing seemed to work\nDuring those seven days he had time to go over this afterlife experiment than he invests it worked out and they'd had it since the early Nineteen hundreds of since before Nineteen Thirteen they had this it's a two way code that they'd worked out if\nOne of them died that they would\nUm use this code contact\nEach other and so he had a week it took him a week to pass away he was so strong and so they had a week together to fine tune this code and then about two years later she gets uh the actual code from Arthur forward\nNow how does our to forget what the medium trans what happens\nIs Arthur Ford was a trance medium he wasn't like I'm\nA Marjory or you know the er which\nFrom her and she's like was was he liked Whoopi Goldberg in a post\n... he just goes into he puts on a blindfold and goes to sleep okay like like Casey all righty goes into the trench\nRight he just goes into a trance state they have to write down everything that happens and then he read later she doesn't really always remember what goes on attendance subconscious but he consciously doesn't really remember\nUh all the time what happened so they transcribe these sands so he started having these senses and in one of them he contacted Houdini some other by the year before this\nAnd then he starts having these senses and he starts getting the code now Houdini messages actually in three parts it's\nOne word than a nine words spell another word and then she it's a two way code I'm Beth has five words in French that she says\nBack to him now does that make sense to you or everybody I talked to a Ninety nine percent of them only think of a one way code you have you're on the other side one word or something\nYou're going to get it across and then they're going to know that you're there but Houdini was sharper than that Houdini said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one who gets right I Want to make its shots\nNah Houdini said listen I'm over on the other side I Want to make sure she gets the code\nThat she's the one who gets\nRight I Want to make its shirts her so she has five words in French that she gets back that come back to him so this was an ingenious code really because it's take it's a ten it's like Fifteen words wow\nWhy why was Harry professor obsessed with either trying to come back spiritually forty even let everybody knew what was going on\n[noise] well ah\nAs you know Harry had to be first\nFirst do skiing\nRight he was a ... Scott pollock just had to be first I don't know if you know that Harry was the first guy to fly an airplane and Australia\nJust she was that's true so\nHe had to be first it matter of fact he did a great movie called the grim game about that so uh and he did several movies he he was a really multi talented guy um I think he would have been I think he would have had a movie um\nCareer you know mogul yeah it had he survived he invented what they call now the dailies uh in in the movie industry he invented that\nAnd it was rush cuts right\nYes so he was a you know awesome\nAnd all these different ways so he was going to be number one and if he had to come back from the grape to do it he was\nGonna do he was going to do it\nDo you think it was successful\nI I Know with successful I Know that the code and the message that he gave was exactly the same message that they that they had agreed upon\nYou didn't know that for a fact didn't comfort professor Bess his wife\n... best was in tough shape ... best was pretty depressed that ... you know her husband had died\nAnd bass was um [noise] she had developed some well I Would consider bad habits she spent money like crazy and she uh\nWhile he was alive and after a\nWhile he was alive and after he died and so if you remember Nineteen twenty nine when the message came back ah all hell broke loose the none of her magic friends really wanted to believe that in any way\nAnd then later in the year the stock market crashes and she loses not only all her friends she loses all her money\nShe was busted stock market yes\nShe loses the majority of her friends the majority of her money and now she's got this bad habit of spending money like a grows on trees she just\nAnd I hear he left a nice little sum\nYeah he liked her a part of the uh they paid double or\n... or whatever for his ah insurance insurance the insurance was twenty five thousand dollars\nWhich in Nineteen thirty six it's probably a lot of money that\nRight ... probably that's close to a million dollars um so\nThey double that because they said it was an accident because this guy punched him and so\nIt was the insurance company that came up and said ah that can happen you can't get appendicitis from being punched and so they were proven wrong in court so she got fifty thousand\nSo she was rolling in do now and then she they put it all in a market and she laughed at all now you have\nSo she was rolling and do now and then she they put it all in a market and she laughed at all\nNow you have heard of the curse that killed Houdini yes what is the curse\n[noise] now Houdini had a three part show the first part of the show was magic\nThe second part was skipped college ... skates he would do an escape\nThat was where the water or the Chinese water torture cell or the uh the milk can escape and then the last part towards the end of his career he would go after the spiritual less than you would have had this um confrontation with a bunch of\nSelf like confrontation right well at some point in time\nHe would say I've had enough and he would get up during a third party he would go out to a palm reader or somebody or a a that he considered fake and you would go in there and all the reporters and everybody to be following him and he'd go in and he'd find a couch or something and they pull out like an incandescent down that goes in the dark\nOr sometimes the I found it I\nGot you you know and\nThen they're probably string or something like that\nRight so ... and of course the the mediums would just let that where do you do that I didn't have nothing to do with that\nWell they honestly didn't because I'm a magician in a magician always have what you call them out the way out you work it into your magic trick if you have a magic trick you might have two or three different methods on how it works and there's something else he switched to the next one and you switch the next\nOne and and it works so you're assured of success and so in his magic that's built in in his escape so of course I'm I guarantee you had two or three keys in there\nYou know and if all that failed and he couldn't get the T best would come out and kiss him and she'd have the appropriate key in her mouth\nAnd just put it into his mouth exactly how\nHe always had an out he always had a way out while it was exactly the same thing for the spiritual spiritual us because he had an agent\nAnd she would go into town and she would find some low hanging fruit she would find some a medium that were obviously tricking people\nBut some she couldn't find what they're doing and she couldn't catch them so she would pull out something from beneath her clothes and like stuff it into the couch\nAnd so later Houdini add a sure thing that he could come back and expose them even though they didn't know anything about it\nIt seems that somebody somewhere the curse on him\nRight so he did this with Marjorie Marjorie was the uh the which from Boston\nUm hold on for ... seconds a professor we rent a break but we'll come right back and talk about the person that you\nTake unlimited ... morning noon or night\nYou can always know how your

professor back to the curse you were talking\nGoes to goes professor she lived with us as we talk about the life of me we'll also talk about magic shortly is well professor back to the curse you were talking about the murder jury duty and explain a little bit more about Marjorie one\nOkay I'm Marjory his real name is a mean a ... and and she was a socialite in Boston she was married to a doctor\nAnd they had kind of a mysterious life she\nUh was said to be really really a sensuous lady uh all the pictures I see she looks pretty average but everybody who met her the thought she was just devastatingly beautiful I don't know why but they did\nUh and uh it had probably has something to do with the way that she did her say on a mean it was that they called her Marjorie and she was the which applying street sometimes they called her the blonde which of Boston\nAnd I was in a complement in those days ago somebody you're which\nI think so I think [laughter]\nI think they uh they got a big kick out of it because I was a lot of people during that time period during the spiritual is movement\nUm a lot of people were having families circles they were all kinds of people that were Catholics are Baptists or whatever on their on their Sunday afternoon or a Saturday they would all get together in the middle of the day and holding hands and somebody would go into a trance and they would try to contact their\nThe feast relatives it was a common back in the twenties\nOkay but this this curse\nRight so up here he goes and he's going to check out mean a ... and\nHe's going to go to Boston and they line up about six ... says that he's going to attend now the Scientific American has a twenty five hundred dollar per se for anybody that can prove that they are a real\nMedium earning her normal and a kind of like the GRE after James Randi educational foundation had a million dollar one here which they never had the right they never had to give it out but they I don't think they actually let anybody who could actually win participate [laughter] I'm\nLike you for that one\nYeah ah well they can they can deflect me all they want I don't think they've played fair and they finally shut it down and they're just giving them money whoever they want a that is interesting that they were taking in about one point five million dollars a year talking about a million dollar contest so they were coming out way ahead\nSo anyway the ah\nThe Scientific American have the same kind of thing going on so they're always going to Marjory he's saying on says so they set this up with six of these and Houdini goes up but he doesn't send\n'em rose Mac and bird that's the agent that usually sends a head what he does the bills a box kind of looks like a son he builds this box and he has um James Collins build it for him\nAnd he builds all of a Houdini props and it's it's designed so that only mean his head in our hands can stick out\nSo she can't get at anything so who d'nese gotta make sure that she can't\nAny trickery so they ah do once they aren't in everything goes according to plan and uh they have what they call a ballot box it's a little a bell inside of a box\nAnd if they push on the ... the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of mean\nOf a box and if they push among the ... the the bell rang and they always put the box outside of the reach of mean\nA and in this particular instance they put it between Houdini slack so there's no way anyone could get at it well in the first ... the bell rings so the second ... brings in the box and he puts her in the box is going to stop it\nAnd they put ... and the second say on the bell rings now\nSo now he's got a fixture in ... we talked about before about there's always an out you have to he has to fix marching Marjorie because he's actually already written a book about her\nHow he's you know exposed her yeah so he's got this book is going to put out so he has to expose her so she comes in uh everybody gets around the same chance\nAnd of course Marjorie\nHas a spirit guide and his name is Walter and its Marjorie brother so Walter she goes into a ... and Walter comes out and just starts cussing and swearing and cursing at Houdini\nAnd he says why did you put this foul thing in here why are you doing this why did you do this I'm cursing you\nThis is ... and this was the spirit saying this right\nThis is the spirit saying it through Marjorie and the spirit Walter puts a death occurs because inside the box is a ruler one of those rulers holds up into three pieces\nYup is one of those all kinds and it's in side the box the only people that had access to the box was Houdini and a James calling\nHow was the curse a professor and then who do you ended up dying\nWell the ... he cursed him and some people say that he said you'll die in a year that that's a you know people debate about that but he died in two years he was totally dead this big strong man died in two years after being cursed by Walter\nScare him\nWell actually Houdini used it in his advertising you can see their Houdini ads all over the place where Houdini advertise that he's under the curse of the spiritual\nDie at any moment\nYeah and really really helped him you know kind of in a way but then you get this concept of the self fulfilling prophecy right they have prophesied that he's gonna die so later when Houdini gets sick\nMaybe this is in the back of his mind and so he doesn't go to the doctor because he\nDoesn't want to prove them right he doesn't want to show that he's getting sick or that something's happened and that kind of my viewpoint of maybe what happened why he didn't go when he first started getting sick\nAnd Arthur for what happened to Arthur Ford Arthur forward toward the world after he gave this or did he I'll live Houdini he outlive all ah she lived until ... Seventy one oh wow okay Arthur\nPoured lived on a fantastic life um so after a Houdini a tries to frame up Marjory I'm he puts out this book he actually fails but he says he does it and he's got these photos of Marjory legs under the table\nAnd then he had some drawings made were her legs\nBut he says he does it and he's got these photos of Marjory flags under the table\nAnd then he had some drawings made where her leg is reaching around his leg so he makes some drawings and puts them in the book where the photo is not anything like that drawing\nOh trickery by Houdini\nYes Houdini once again is doing this and um there was a guy named Walter ... Gibson and he is probably one of if not the number one\nA expert on ... he worked with Houdini he worked with John injure and then he worked with ... and she makes a statement that there's a a a bombshell in in the interview crafting and\nHe gives this quote by Gibson it says when will magicians realize that Houdini was often just honest as the mediums he purported\nTo expose wow that's pretty heavy\nThat is heavy coming from the number one guy so he knew that they were putting 'em ... James Collins in there and that uh the rose Mac and bird was going ahead and and they were setting them up so he would have a great show the three parts show\nMhm and it's back in and create an in your room [noise] more information dizzy creeps ... ... troops for kids dot org messages sponsored by the division in public and behavioral health care to cooperation with Nevada broadcasters association and the season\n[noise] Hi I'm Aaron tailor the real estate guy might help Nevada residents buy and sell over five thousand homes since Nineteen Ninety four\nForty eight realty is proud to partner with the Nevada broadcasters association in recognizing the Nevada military support alliance Nevada servicemen and women are battle born and often stand in harm's way to fight for our freedom with some giving the ultimate sacrifice mayor and Taylor the real estate guy and I am Nevada proud\nSponsored by over ... corporation with a better Rochester associate justice of heart\n... studios pentium north Las Vegas ...

talking about it on the nineteenth on your lighter and I'm calling\nFrom Detroit when I started listening I Lived in Tennessee at the time but just the fact that correlation of\nDetroit and I just wanted to say that I Believe\nThat's that's a that's a great story rich thanks for that Houdini was in the Detroit River when he was in town before he died was he not professor\nYeah I think I think that was one of his one of his skates yeah\nYou really want they dumped him in the Detroit River I think he was in a straight jacket upside down\nYeah that you love doing that and sometimes he was in a box Houdini would uh he would modify his escapes to whatever uh you know kind of businesses that wanted to support them\nSo ah you know if the police supported him either scape from one of their jail cells ah there was one tiny escape from a like big fish they built the big fish 'cause it was a fish company that was sponsoring him in their town\nSo he would he would it kind of knew if he would make up some way to escape from something that tied in to his advertisers\nTony Curtis died in the twenty ... years old but I thought he did a great job in that ... movie you remember it\nYes yeah I think all of the movies had been actually pretty good yeah\nAh I don't they don't stick with the actual\nHow did how did he make that elephant disappear in the ... in London how did he do that well can you want me to tell you yeah you know the truth [laughter] I mean what did he how do they have the thing covered or or what first of all\n[noise] ah no I Can't tell I'm not gonna tell\n'em come on smile I might tell you in private there's a book you can buy a ... by a guy who who who\nIt can't to I'm not gonna tell on come on now I might\nTell you on private there's a book you can buy a ... by a guy who who\nHill and let me ask you this if I'm right would you tell me\nYes ... ... ... ... if you are right all I'll tell you have to tell you on air\nYeah well I'm just going to ask you if you question okay that's or did he have any apparatus that raises the elephant from underground you\nKnow you did not okay I'm going to assume that the elephant was always there\nYes\nOkay we'll do a little more homework yeah yeah they do know what who\nComes up with the tricks I mean was it Houdini does that make him a genius for being able to come up with this or did he have somebody on staff like you who would say here's this trick\nAnd let's do this and we can make this and that how did they do this he's saying what's called puck Copperfield to I assume ... people on staff like you right\nExactly exactly um James Collins when the guy that Houdini the built all inform but Houdini would say I want to do this and then he would put it in the ball in their court and then they would have to come up with how you would\nDo so I assume in the HIPAA Jerome they walk in Allison out everybody sees this thing lumbering in ... and then they're shrouded in er cloaked in or something and then the trick began I it's absolutely amazing wasn't the queen there at the time\n[noise] uh well he\nProbably the same queen that's there and [laughter]\nYou know Europe but I don't think she was at their okay I I don't know for sure next on it I don't think she was there I think he performed for them in Europe\n... let's go to the first time caller Ralph in Indianapolis ... go ahead\nSir I'm here already taken away readings\nOr I knew I refer to oil and the last five years of his life got a letter from him just before he died of seeing bishop pike on a ledge when he was trying to go over to comb Ron in Israel and that's where they found him\nA question for you or what we what year did archer forward bring back the code to Mrs Houdini\nThis was in Nineteen twenty nine okay with a three part code or the code was the middle section first were was rows and rows and then he had a code for the nine or words spelled out believe\nAnd then she had Dr words in French which mean I pulled the curtain back like this and that's what she told him so he was a shirt that his coat had gotten through now didn't he she later denied that\nLater on a after she loses her friends she loses all her money a man a called Edward Said comes into her life\nAnd says he's er manager but they live together\nShe fell in love again yeah so\nHe didn't like that and that's why you wanted to come back\nRight she meet women the same kind of way that there's a lot of things going on here but he's like Twenty years younger than her ... promise her that\nShe can make a movie and she'll make a million dollars okay go ahead rules or what\nYour than they deny that the code was correct well the first time she never denies the code was correct uh she says she was full but she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year\nShe says she was pool but she never denies that the code was correct but she first about a year and a half after um she they're given the Houdini messages\nShe having lunch with some ladies in Miami and she ... she said she was hesitant about a\nHoudini coming back because why didn't he favor from the depression so she was she thought that Houdini would somehow save her from this math\nDepression that what's happening or that somehow he was going to come back and have breakfast with her every morning or something I don't know what she was thinking but she wasn't happy about the fact that\nUh our before it was on tour somewhere so she had no way to contact him and so she was you know showing this pleasure for that then Edward St comes in later promises or a million dollars and then they go on\nAnd about eight years later they make a movie called a a religious racket years\nYeah he made a ... a a couple of movies bleach Disney\nWell Houdini made for five movies\nYeah but they also how they do they do well\nOr they did fine but he was he was the star of of every movie\nWas he like an actor or were they more like documentaries\nThey he was an actor and he always had like a really really good looking co star\nHis real name Eric Weiss yes\nHe was he was a pretty good looking guy too\nI kind of a sudden I'm often guy you was only in everything\nKind of a smooth smooth talker could really give a a ... compliments really well but he wasn't the greatest actor but he used it to promote his escape so we had a bunch of escapes and have all the movies\nReal name Eric white some\nMhm yes and that's Eric turned into Harry and then who dating he got from who Don and he added and I called in Houdini and er so to this day they called him Harry Houdini but I don't think he ever a sweatshirt name and he was born in Europe\nAnd he wasn't born here and he was he was born in Hungary yeah he was born in Hungary Budapest and he wasn't even actually\nA U.S citizen if you think was in the ... name Blackstone did he come after hearing\nA black son was after Harry yeah\nOkay 'cause he was pretty good too was and he\nHe was great he was

Houdini began calling himself a missed the fire uh he kind of drop the magician thing\nOkay and so people are starting to go that way it's\nPart of the mystery art you know\nWhen people go see ... would you do they want the trick to seal or succeed what do you think\nWell I think they all want it to succeed I think you'd be a strange individual if you'd like to see the guy fall on his face\nNot some people who want to see that\nYeah maybe maybe uh I don't ah\nI see I Want I Want to see the the trek professor and then try to figure out what happened how we did it\nRight that's me when I when

right thanks for coming on again we look forward to this so they're not bad movies they're just misunderstood I've been singing that line ever since you taught at times\nOh you know it's it's interesting because you know at the end of the day [noise] I mean I like going to the movie I enjoy going to the movies\nAh sometimes your team loses\nBut you still have a good time and I think that's the important thing uh I'm not going to stop going to the movies you know I I think that's the only or perhaps the parallel sports fan you know sometimes your team doesn't quite you know they just don't quite get it together but they're still your team so you're there\nBut isn't the airport but but isn't it true that some of these misunderstood movies uh I actually have an own have their own entertainment value it's well beyond just to send them experience is a completely different level of entertainment\nSure absolutely yeah I I recently we've just wrapped a feature rant about ed wood for the mystery science theater box that other thirtieth anniversary can you believe mystery science theaters Thirty years old\nOr a ... it's funny you say that because I watch mystery science theater at least one every every day and that's not a joke and um I listen to some of the jokes and I laugh at them and I think to myself you know and sometimes I think wow these are thirty year old jokes nice joke yeah tell me the poignant\nPoint if they are even today yeah\nYeah and but in some cases uh somebody new to this series was somebody in their twenties might not get some of them because they're like pop culture reference of the day\n[noise] [noise] yes well you know the interesting thing about that one I guess that's probably why they have the new one which has more current references on it\nWhich I don't get what I watched that one and I am confused because that will get the yeah I\nI'm not a you know um I I like to give the the new ones more of a chance to buy wife can't even give it she she won't allow it she she still stuck on Mike and Joel and she's she's not ready to lead another\nHost into her heart I don't think that show but anyhow on on the mystery science theater a feature that Mr Mr ...\nOn the new mystery science theater box that and I'm Talking about it would hand specifically the film sinister urge but overall it's\nIt would that would it's not just [noise]\nThere's a whole his wife was so interesting he was so interesting as a person the whole experiential idea of this guy trying to make movies in the fifties I'm I\nAm so much to it so much beyond what's just physically there in one particular movie um his career was really entertaining and and interesting\nAnd I think that's expressed really well in the um [noise]\nTim Burton film it would ah which I Would recommend as a\nCannot have a radio nope I did I did it come through the living dead I Can't hear you guys\nYeah yeah I did it came through and that's a great great a choice that if\nYou're a Pittsburgh I grew up there like it out from Pittsburgh so I've got a partial to it but there's a lot of good ones out there that new one does it look bad I Love Jamie Lee Curtis ... see what the what the verdict there's that one\nYeah daycare I Do to fix every night and\nI have to say I'm not the living dead is one of my ... my top five not just of horror movies but of films I Love the heart and soul that went into it\nI Love the concept is presented for it today and I love the fact that it was made on a shoestring budget didn't really was quality filmmaking and launched the career during the boom arrow\nWho has since become a horror icon\nIt's amazing how many of these small movies have endured like you think of ... which was made in a small community here in Phoenix bill or a near ... near near Philadelphia in Phoenix though\nAnd uh coatesville and surrounding areas and that was likely another thing where the whole town came together the fire department the police department and the you know and they made this movie uh and then even carnival soles I think it was that Kansas and are you talking about what we're all that was spent on\nAnd again it was just a you know a a an effort shoestring budget you know and everyone knows ... making a film on a shoestring\nAs difficult because it's much harder to load and do a camera than standard film\n[laughter] but\nBut you know you get these movies in door and then there's these multi million dollar movies that have come and have gone I mean who knows what the a list movie of Nineteen fifty nine lives but everybody knows plan nine from outer space and who knows what\nWho knows what the a list\nOf Nineteen fifty nine lives but everybody knows plan nine from outer space\nAnd who knows what the a list movie of Nineteen sixty eight was but everybody knows neither the living dead [noise] um [noise] and um [noise] so it is interesting how these big Hollywood movies with bloated budget send and stars\nI'm a lot of them uh fate and a lot of these so called low rent\nDrive in movies I'm much like mom's home cooking you know it's just they just come back year after year after year you want that you want that same uh [noise] you know you want that feeling you want that uh that intimacy and maybe intimacy is is the key is that you feel you feel like you could feel the love it and\nYou are you mentioned another one of my favorites carnivals schools um which tops my list as well\nUm what makes Mr liberal what makes a good quote unquote bad movie what what did they wouldn't greedy and to make the movie that you know has so many laws are so many are unforgettable moments not on a good site actually enjoyable movie in there for a good bad movie\nI you know I thought about this a lot and I I feel like you can't make a bad movie on purpose I think if you try to make a bad movie on purpose and you succeed did you succeed or did you fail\nI think to a certain degree I think that for\nIt to be a really good bad movie um it has to be earnest effort\nAnd um and I think that uh in case of ed wood I think people can tell there's earnest effort they're they're just a lack of time and money and\nAnd resources you know if it takes five apples to make a movie ed wood maybe had two and a half three apples that most of his entire career so what he was doing was not really ... and he didn't have a choice between making a good movie and making it bad movie it was making a movie or not making a movie at all\nAnd um and I think that that fearlessness of gang let's let's do this so let's let's\nLet's let's make a movie um and I I you know a lot of people aren't don't have that courage to try to do something they have no business do [laughter] so I think that that's important I think that it has to be earnest I think the other aspect of it\nIs a I think that it's very easy to um [noise]\nYou know spend too much money on and move into that sounds ridiculous but\nI think that um [noise] you know when you look at a movie like the Terminator versus um the second Terminator the first Terminator is scary because you could you don't you don't feel like they're protecting a franchise\nThere's this aspect of it where you know the Terminator could just kill 'em Sarah Connor and that could have been the end of the movie but the second one it just feels like this big book a blockbuster and they want to do twelve or their movies\nAnd I feel like\nYou know if you've got this aspect of it [noise] where um it feels like they've got a franchise to protect\nYou know or it feels like it's it's it's a it's to reference to itself I mean you know I'm I think that that kind of can make it I'm\nNot you know you're you're you're you're in a realm of a different kind of ... and I think that also uh\nI think it's gotta be for it to be a good bad movie you know people always like to make fun of movies with aliens and a serial killers and cowboys and ... and these are entertaining movie they aspects to them you know\nKind of pope aspects to them a vet\nAnd ... and these are entertaining movie they've aspects to them you know\nKind of hope aspects to them uh that are enjoyable ... the the worst movies in the world are you know a disease or the week movie\nMade for a lifetime with Meredith Baxter Birney or you know some romantic comedy from seven years ago with extreme culture you know these are movies we don't remember you know a melodramas and [noise] and uh [noise]\nUm you know dry I'm\nYou know a historical dramas you know these are things that\nYou know they get boring so I think I think that's the other aspect of it is that for it to be a good bad movie I think it has to have\nA subject matter that it's a ... enticing vampires ... zombies a zombie cheerleaders whatever whatever whatever but an aspect and exploit herbal aspect that makes it fun so those are those who I think would be the ingredients do a good at all\nWell and you're talking about Terminator yeah Terminator was a phenomenal movie and of course it wasn't the super budget movie on on that compared to a some but than Terminator two I mean that I Believe that the time that was the most expensive movie that I had ever been been done at the time with the special effects and uh\nWith the whole Terminator to being able to turn a liquid metal and all that stuff and yeah you could definitely tell that they were sort of over the top with that movie and it never really did as well as the first ones I I totally understand what you're saying well\nIt it made a lot of money but it does it in doors lectures the first one ... a lot of people go back and watch the first one but you don't hear a lot of people say oh I Want to watch Terminator two yeah\nThese are really um you've been doing this a while and ah you've seen a lot of bad slash misunderstood movies were to get to phone calls ... minutes if you're on hold please be patient um but one of the things I've noticed\nIs that the one that that person's view or the bad movies that still um capture attention developed cult followings\nAnd show up whenever there is a bad movie festivals all seem to have a poor side by connection for the most part maybe there's some exceptions to this but for the most part it's that those genres horse I find that really really seem to have these types of movies why is that\nWell to be honest I Would I Would go even I Would go even further than that because I I think honestly horror and science fiction or both sub genres of fantasy you know in America we spent the fantasy of guys with for camp and swords but\nReally fantasy is the larger thing and I think anything that is going to be an escape [noise] anything that is a diversion from\nReality I think ah is always going to be\nBig entertainment for people who need an escape and ah I I think that and and those those kinds of movies are movies that people liked intellectually\nObsess on and I that's how I Would define a cult movie or they are movies that we intellectually obsess on we talk about them we proselytize them to our friends and say hey you got to see this movie so there has to be something in it that hey you got to see this 'cause you're not going to see it anywhere else\nOr let's jump to our phone lines up to go to Paul also in North Carolina he pulled welcome to the program\nHey gentleman a love love a beyond radio ... uh beyond reality radio about and\nAs a a sidebar to what I was originally going to talk about ah when you're speaking of a good bad movies I Want to say girls town where Mel Torme a played a a\nA leather jacket wearing ... and the uh the tortured\nTeenager I think her name was Sarah feeding or something and was maybe van Dorn in that\nWearing ... and the uh the tortured teenager I think her name was Sarah feeding or something and was maybe van Dorn in that\nWow I write you know I don't\nI don't know that so yeah I heard it's it's it's really really really hard to find I saw it originally on a mystery science theater\nThat's where I saw it was you know and that's where my son too but\nThere there is a class of ... it's a very hard mood to fight there is a classification of movie gentleman\nUm ed so and they're good movies they're good movies but movies you've seen ones but you're not sure if you're going to handle them a second time and I'm thinking of a couple of French movies one of them um irreversible the other one was a vagabond [noise]\nAnd um and there was an American made movie that was a\nAn excellent movie but wow hard to watch\nAt where I'm Ellen Burstyn played a a a senior citizen who was um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "31"}
