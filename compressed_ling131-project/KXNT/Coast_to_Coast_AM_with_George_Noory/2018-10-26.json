occurred how're you doing now\n[noise] well George I'm definitely doing better one of the things that's really helped me to come to terms with how I think of a finite and the Internet and in ...\nOne of the things that's really help to me\nIs to come to terms with how I think of the finite and the infinite and in my own simple explanation I don't think I'm anything unique I think each of us as human beings has disability\nBut I think of the brain as the infinite zone and I think of the body as the finite zone and for the anatomical side of this the brainstem connects the brain to the rest of the body\nAnd so I think that anything that we think about is infinite and once it goes down through the brainstem it becomes finite and so in meditative thought and thinking to higher levels of spirituality we all have that ability and the infinite zone where each of us is a combination of the infinite and the finite\nWhat did you think of the afterlife prior to this happening\nI have to say that I I question that I didn't think about it much and\nEver since Ralph passed away I set out on a journey to try and understand more of it which is what led me to read books and to be more open minded and to be more observant of the things that were occurring in front of me\nNone of the goals really didn't get to the second three strange occurrences that occurred I Want to go through each one you explain to us what happened tell us about the drivers which went out there\nSo about eight months ago I had a gun in a new verb from downtown St Louis I was getting dropped off and I told the driver a funny story and he thought it was funny enough that he wanted to repeat it and I said you know I don't have a problem with it tell anybody you want\nAnd he looked at me in a very strange stare and said\nI'll just tell them Ralph set it looked and I looked at him he said what's wrong I said where did you come up with that name he said I don't know and I said well you know anybody named morale he said no she how did you come up with it he said it popped in my head\n[laughter] I Love about one with the balloons what happened there\nWell the day Ralph passed away he left me a two mylar balloons a smiling balloon Anna thank you balloon in the morning and after he passed away I decided I wasn't going to touch the balloons I just couldn't do it\nAnd the mylar balloons state inflated for many months two three four five months and one friday I went to sleep I got up Saturday morning and the balloons were both down\n[noise] I didn't think much about it until the following Monday and the cemetery called me and said we just want to let you know that the gravestone on friday was set for your son\nGets timing in secret and then you had the courage some strange lights\n[noise] well I moved out of our home rather rapidly after he passed away and I went back up into the room and I turned off the lights and I was leaving in the house was empty\nAnd the lights went back on and I and I had a friend with me during the lights back\nWith the light switch back down put it back up put it back down they went off\nThe lights went back on this happened two or three times until the lights finally stayed off and at that time I left the house\nAnd just let it be I chose not to think more about it other than that had never happened before\nIt was a point where you got ... about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem\nWere you got angry about all this\n[noise] you know I've been asked them many times and I don't seem to be able to get angry about it I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing [noise] um [noise] I don't I don't fault Tam I\nHave a struggle to try to understand how the generic drug industry in the United states has effectively shielded themselves from any and all liability from every American citizen\nWell they're they're protected by federal law aren't they\nIs there is there is a federal law in place and I'm not an attorney but the the outcome of the law is that generic drugs effectively have a liability shield around them\nJohnathan which was we're all subject to depression prior to the food poisoning\nNo Ralph was a very happy go lucky kid he was very popular in his class he was a straight a student\nAh frequently making jokes he was just if you ask is friends they would portray just the most honest I'm likeable young man you could you could think of\nNot to go to the hospital for food poisoning that's pretty serious because you know most people who have food poisoning stay at home they take some stuff uh you know they're going to the bathroom is often they have to they don't go to the hospital ... what were the symptoms for him to go to the hospital I\nI think I think he was vomiting profusely there was a lot of blood was out with his friends who were all medical school students as well and they unanimously decided he needed to go to the emergency room and that's how he got there how did you get that cool [noise]\nWell I got the call after the medication had been given to him about the next morning and he said to me immediately I feel different something has happened\nOh okay let's go to some culture for you and let's go to Patty in Seattle, Washington questions story Hi Patty\nHi uh I've I've got a little story and I hope it's relevant to\nThe sink and

of earth could be there and the first place\nYou have the clue that there is another planet out in the solar system\nReally came from looking at the very most distant objects that are in orbit around the sun well beyond Pluto they travel extreme distances and all these ones that are this far away all sweep often one particular direction and there's no reason they should they should be randomly around the sky's the facts\nIt all sweep often one particular direction and there's no reason they should there should be randomly around the sky is the fact that they're all off in this one direction you can only be explained by the presence of a planet that's perturbation their orbits and keeping them piled up in that direction\nAnd that what the new headlines in October of twenty Eighteen are about is one of those smaller objects that are being swept off my whatever the massive ... called planet nine that you discovered in twenty sixteen\nThat's exactly right although I don't use the word discovered yet I Would say we proposed the planets and when we see it it will have been discovered\nWhat do you need to people who ask questions about rogue planet and they ... through the ana knock ears Marion and all of that because it does come up a lot\nWhat exactly are rogue planet how can planet be wandering in the universe between sellers systems in galaxy\nThere certainly are these wandering planets rogue planets and they come about from the same sort of reason that we think that planet nine is out there they certainly formed around a star just like our planets did and then probably a couple of planets got too close to each other\nAnd one of them got tossed out usually the smaller one gets tossed out by the bigger one\nAnd in our case we think that that happened to planet nine but planet nine didn't get past quite far enough so now it's just hanging around on the outer edge but if you could have gotten a little bit closer to say Jupiter could have been completely injected from our solar system\nIn which case it would just be wandering through space and so it is absolute certainty that these sorts of things exist there's no question about it when\nPeople ask me about the bureau that's always a funny one because of course that's a conspiracy theory that there is a giant planet that's going to destroy the earth that NASA knows about and won't tell anybody and\nThings like that and I try very hard to explain to people that this is just crazy YouTube Internet conspiracy stuff that actually makes no sense\nExplains for a general world audience why something massive like a planet cannot sneak up on earth in the inner planets with out every astronomer on for knowing\nIf something like number I don't know what's the latest crazy conspiracies are saying how big it is but occasionally over to headline that it's going to destroy the earth on some particular date because it's screaming into the inner solar system\nUsually if you do just a very quick calculation you realize if it were really coming it would be so bright\nThat you could see it with binoculars every person who owns binoculars on the planet could go look and see it coming you wouldn't be able to have a massive conspiracy keeping it secret\nAnd you would have been visible to every backyard astronomer with the post group for the past decade and it would have been visible every professional astronomer for the past fifty years if all of these people are in on the conspiracy I don't know anywhere else were that many people are all keeping a secret from the rest of the world\nIs something ten times the mass of our earth where even out how to do out in the ... what would be the obvious observation all changes perturbation in our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers would be an apartment in the planets that we know of planning and has no\nIn our solar system\nIn the inner part of our soldiers would be an apartment in the planets that we know of but it's not and has no effect whatsoever on the inner planets\nAnd you can figure out why it's ten we actually think more like seven o seven times amounts of the earth and it is five hundred times further away from the sun than the earth is\nJupiter on the other hand is three hundred times the mass of the earth and it's only five times further from the sun than the earth is so Jupiter has a tremendous effect on the planets in the solar system and nobody sits around and there's worry that Jupiter is certainly going to come destroy us\nPlanet nine is really far away and quite a bit smaller than Jupiter sort of its effect it's really minimal one affected it does have is that over four billion years is capable of slowly tilting the orbits of the planets but even that is just a very very minor effect\nIf you're going to Hawaii in November and maybe you'll be successful this time would it be possible to talk with you in December about what you might find or you have to wait to do papers or\nJust the way the process works is we'll go there in November will collect the data it'll take us several weeks to months to process the data from November then we're back there first of December and will do the same thing and so\nIf we have found what we're looking for we will know it within a month or two of collecting those data and then at that point will announce its existence as soon as we can confirm it we will have found it will go back to the telescope and double checked that it's really there\nAnd then will announce its existence right away we won't make the world wait\n[laughter] January I'm twenty nine teen it is possible that three years after twenty sixteen January when we did our first interview about it that you might be able to confirm it\nIs possible I'm always very optimistic Constantine fatigue in my partner and all this is always much more pessimistic and so you know you should take my optimism with a grain of salt and then take his pessimist than with a grain of salt he thinks it'll take us another ten years I think it will take us one year so maybe that means still another three years but I'm Still very optimistic\nSo there you have a ... right from the man who discovered this uh in terms of those ... nations\nOf those half a dozen bodies that are all kind of gather together out where the guy prevailed in the ... cloud in that area and I think one of the most important part of doing the research projects with these scientists is that I had no confusion\nAbout the fact that if there was something massive\nThat was trying to move in to our solar system what it's called the inner solar system\nFrom a mercury the sun and mercury out to wear a now Neptune and urine is our because Pluto is a than dumb down to a dwarf planet out in the hyper belt\nThat there is nothing they could be out coming this way and massive that wouldn't be picked up by everyone everywhere because gravity\nThat that's the thing about gravity and that it it would have impact on every single thing and\nThat's when we I would've loved those Zacharias itching do than to live to talk with the professor I Wonder if you would have been able to convince him about that ...\nWell I don't know how much time we have left but I can start my own work\nSimple bought that new bureau\nWell I don't know how much time left but I can start my own work\nThat I had a discussion a face to face eye to eye with is that right yeah and maybe what I Do have that for conversations that lend it because it's really quite a story\nOkay we can do that too but it's a great story and it's really exciting\nThat even if\nHe doesn't agree in some of the theories that are out there the fact that there's this extra planted out there does echo what some of these people have said long before anybody even knew about this stuff well\nThe idea that that could be a planet but when you read like say about the ana knocking through scholar and ... that translation that\nWe're a card and\nDon and you look at the carving but one thing that\nCredit card companies would rather you didn't know that there are ways you can become dead three and you don't have to pay the entire

knowing what you were back with ... whose story next we'll deal with climate change window\nYeah you know Thirty years ago and Nineteen eighty eight when the world with really kind of waking up seriously for the first time to global climate change\nAnd real potential dire consequences in the future if we didn't get on top of the expanding methane and carbon dioxide blankets around the earth\nAnd at the United nations many countries especially those worried about being islands in which sea level rise could flood and\nDisplaced populations they came together to form the inter governmental panel on climate change also known as the eye PCC and the objective was to provide data about earth changes on an ongoing basis\nTo help project some of these impacts on world politics and the economy\nBy twenty Fifteen only three years ago and the Paris Agreement on climate change\nMany small island nation were so worried about disappearing under ... rising sea levels that the PCC committed they're doing a twenty Eighteen report written by Ninety One scientist from forty countries\nThe question was should humans restrict global warming two degrees Celsius or one point five degrees Celsius below pre industrial levels the October twenty Eighteen IPC the answer is\nStricter at one point five degrees Celsius equal to a to point seven degrees Fahrenheit should be the new target to achieve and hold in place by twenty thirty that's the only a decade from now\nIf we don't if I planet continues to warm up above that limit of one point five degrees Celsius\nScientists warn that would be a catastrophe of math die offs they will accelerate and the coral reef and if they die that kills off other marine species dependent upon the coral\nWeather will become more violent and wins flooding rains and devastating wildfires weather extremes will cause famine and fighting over land food in freshwater\nAnd sea level rise will force more and more Ireland and coast populations to move\nLand food in freshwater and sea level rise will force more and more island the coasts populations to move but to where the twenty Eighteen I PCC report said the next ten years\nBetween now and twenty thirty are crucial and in order to keep the one point five degrees Celsius limit nations must cut greenhouse gas emissions\nBy almost half of what they were in twenty ten\nSolar wind and other renewable energy sources must replace as much as sixty seven percent of today's electricity\nCoal it as an industry around the world it must be phased out the coordinating lead author or the IPC the

would be the five top nations in the world that are now Ireland and other places that are most impacted by the level right\nAround the world unfortunately all too many very low lying countries and that's a large part of why we have this new report those\nCountries want to the United nations to investigate a lower woman target thinking that\nTwo degrees was probably not sufficient to protect

because it was like it would be given to me but I couldn't decipher it\nDo you have do any sub text in your mind or your soul about who we'd be doing this and why for the future\nNo the only thing I couldn't think of was that it made because in my past experience with ever since I was a child I've had psychic dreams\nDreams of having relationships with an entity that was giving the instructions I can describe the entity to you as a very thin very white pale density I couldn't see a face\nAll I Know it was very skinny it hadn't very long fingers how many\nI don't know how many fingers that had

that was a year that had been presented to me by a real whistle blower this is science which said that uh he had worked on a project having to do with this exact time period between twenty Eighteen and twenty twenty six\nIn which there could be some either a natural cycle or something that is going to snap it's like what Charles hazard when he was saying I feel like it has to do with the rotation of the earth that there's going to be like a shift or a jolt\nAnd that it would cause tsunamis in tremendous amounts of flooding and I have had now several emails I'm going to be doing stories on them about exactly this kind of thing and raising the question could there be a natural strange cycle\nInteracting with planets in our solar system that could relate to know is flood that has written about in genesis\nAnd that is how woven and a complex all of this seems to be going that every single question is leading to answers that people are raising more issues and scientists are

around 'cause it was really the book a grassy field in between the apartment\nSo I look up and I see a lot of light light in the sky a suit was on an airplane that same light than I was looking at it 'cause it was only going in the sky\nI noticed something was coming down and by the time my notes you may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at key\nIt may have been about I'd say fifty or sixty feet off the ground the light that I was looking at came down it was in or\nWhat I noticed about that was one half of it was so white collar and the other half of it was neon green color you know like the glow sticks that you see at the concerts when they had to close the extent are neon green glow sticks right\nLook like that and I was saying to myself this looks like a perfect circle but it's a little all is if you cut the perfect circle in half and then just pull it apart a little bit\nA little lighter in the middle then it would it then is that we're perfect circle\nYeah and I noticed there were two lights met in the middle the salt white light in the lime green light there was no bleed over you could clearly see where the neon green ended in the fall Hawaii began and this object it looked to be as thin as a balloon\nWhen you say he was like a balloon you mean that in the surface was translucent and you could see through it\nYeah I could clearly see through it it was no metal nothing like that it was more like a balloon so the and it's like you're looking at a seafood for long and what are you seeing\nWhat I'm seeing is a person standing inside the fall of white part wearing like down and he's looking up is just standing there looking up like he's looking up into the bars I don't know what are you looking at but I could clearly see this and I'm saying to myself\nLook at that that's a person and keep in mind I'm no more than twenty five to thirty feet from this week that the only reason I didn't climb out the

know I Know she is but I just didn't understand that the key is the significance of this\nOkay this is very close to you if you are looking at this window describe the person that you are seeing in the white side of this circular orbit\nWhy give you my thoughts at the time this was the conversation I was having to myself\nI was thinking man this person looks like God\nAnd then I thought I'm not going to say that unless he actually pills that you need a hot right then I'll go out man the sure looks like the guy in the picture at church\nDescribe everything the galley was wearing white\nWhen you're looking at this fall white I noticed it was bright or brighter colors and the white light\nYou can tell the difference between fall white and bright white I could clearly see that they're getting our white\nVery bright white he was looking up and he was Caucasian and he had a brunette hair and it came down to I'd say his shoulder to shoulder lanes mhm and he was just standing there looking up\nWhat his hair strange way the poor curly\nI'd say it was straight dislike you see when you see these motion pictures are Jesus of ... ... it was like that\nWere you close enough to see the shape or color and he's I\nKnow I wasn't close enough to see that\nAnd ... was the shape of the down\nFrom what I could see it looked like it pulled over his head that all look like one ... piece and they went all the way down\nFrom what I could see it looked like it pulled over his head that all look like one toilet piece and they went all the way down to is pretty\nCould you see his feet in this your uncle\nCraft no I couldn't so how do you know it went down to his seat\nBecause I could see that where the or where he was ... it was at the very bottom of it I could clearly see the whole beer

doing animal mutilation instead of making us line up to do an animal sacrifices\nBut what ever it is that is the truth behind the UFO phenomena on our planet earth I Do not think it is singular I think that there are many facets\nI think that some facets are truly allies and if we had not had allies whether they are from another solar system in this universe or from another dimension\nI Do not think homo sapiens safety and would have survived the the last several thousand years without help from something else why the hell does it make itself front and in our face this is who they are may

not just a public persona for perhaps a covert\nYou know shy to CERN white Gary of fifty one well I have\nHeard these kinds of rumors but\nOn the other hand I've interviewed gosh by now I at least a dozen people who have been doing different experiments at different times it's the Large Hadron collider is the way that they refer to it\nAnd I think it started a because I have interviewed one of the physicists who was responsible for a proposal to see if they could generate many black holes\nBy getting the uh Hadron Collider up to a certain speed but here was the reason and it makes sense to me\nThat if they could generate little black holes that could sustain for a certain period of time\nAnd they could make measurements that there were any gravity waves moving in to the black holes this is the key gravity waves moving into small black holes\nIt would automatically confirms another dimension and that was it seemed to me a legitimate to ah just based on all the reading that I have done with on kept thorns work and others\nAre I at least ... what it was that they were proposing now that's one of the tests that was laid out a in paper or to do two or three years ago\nAnd there were headlines in the u._k. daily sensational newspapers and others that\nCERN was going to be making black holes that would destroy the yours and many black hole we're not going to destroy the earth in any way shape or form um there are probably many black holes being generated and moving away all of the time everywhere\nIt was designed and that this is what's important the Large Hadron collider is a great tester\nOf hypotheses having to do with gravity and dark energy and dark matter and dark black holes in all of it and that's what it is designed to try to do and it's not very easy\nAnd so when there were these really terrible headlines about many black holes being generated that we consume the earth\nIt was just to me it was frustrating I Can't imagine what the poor scientists feel like\nAnd it's not true and therefore we're constantly getting ignorance and the Web that in many ways is turning into a cesspool where\nPeople are making a quarters and pennies on clicks through on

speaker\nRoller derby player and pushing maker among other things so a man of\nMany talents and he joins us on the phone line right now we welcome Tom half just to beyond reality radio Tom how're you doing this evening\nGreat thank you so much for having meal well we are very she ate 'em having you with us\nUm I guess at some point I'll have to ask you about being a roller derby player but that will probably not be our first priority a on a night um I Want to start by talking about a micro dosing um I I looked it up and and I have a little bit of a sense of what it is but if you could explain for our listeners\nWhat exactly is Mike Rowe dosing\nShort short a micro do so is the practice of ... small amounts of a psychedelic mushrooms or LSD not not a a trip that now but it actually in ... to actually win excite you're central nervous system which is a good many positive\nAh benefits to the human experience or improve mood improved creativity or more energy throughout the day\nSo um that's mostly what Mike or do something that's just me these very ... and now the second tower\nSo because they are so imperceptibly there's really no danger element here\nOh well no I wouldn't say that there there there's there's always a danger element with anything anytime you put something in your body from smoking a cigarette to eat and get a a chicken that wasn't cooked right so uh I Do want to say that if you're the kind of if you have any um a heart issues labor dosing is probably not\nA good for you if you have\nA family history of mental illness a micro does things probably not a good idea if you're taking ss our eyes\nNiagara dosing probably not a good idea but if you are a reasonably healthy person of sound mind and body than a no there really isn't any harm to it\nOne of your books micro dosing magic a psychedelic bell book tell us a little bit about this book\n[noise] sure so uh what I wanted to do was take micro do civil to another level and um show people that they could actually get way more\nOut of the doses their take on so I tend to differentiate between micro dosing micro dose of magic whereas leg or does things just taking the dos and going about your day with\nSo I tend to differentiate between micro dosing and micro do some magic whereas micro does things just taking the dos and going about your day with Michael do some magic year doing\nBrain exercises um you're doing creativity exercises you're doing emotional work along with it you're taking your does with a little tension ah because ... intention is so important not just for magic but for transforming your life so\nIt's it's just a a more um [noise] let's say high octane form of micro dosing\nYou talking about brain exercises explain that a little bit what do you mean by breathing exercise\nOkay so for starters on days that I'll take my micro does I'll also used by non dominant hand which is my left hand all day if I have to type out a text message I'm if I'm just brushing my teeth in the morning I'm so things like that or a let's see what would\nBe another one I'm not talking for an entire day and not an entire day where you know you're just binge watching you know the lord of the rings trilogy a couple of times over\nBut you plan a very active day with friends with family you go out you go bike riding you go to dinner and you don't say a word what this does his forces you to listen far more\nAnd take in what other people are saying uh I Know that we tend to think that we do that all the time in conversations but most of the time we're just waiting for the other person to stop talking so that we can talk a that is a great way to expand your mind simply learning how to listen to others\nI don't think I've ever done that I had laryngitis once many many years ago and so physically I could not speak but that must be very hard to consciously not speak for a full twenty four hours\nSure that's actually not even the hardest one or the hardest one that I Do with that I have in my book is you you can speak for the day but you cannot use the word\nI so now I Want this I Want that I remember the other thing\nYou cannot use the word I now two things you'll notice real fast if you tried this exercise one you're going to have to come up with some very creative ways to say sentences which again goes back to those brain exercises that you really have to think because most of the time when we think we start our sentences with the word I\nThe second thing you'll notice doing this is how much when your friends are coming to you to seek advice you're just using that as an excuse to talk about yourself\n[noise] so are these are just a few of the things that um that would contribute to a micro dosing magic more than just micro do some\nTalk a little bit about possible side effects dangers of micro dosing you mentioned some people may have a pre existing condition which indicates they shouldn't get involved in this but let's say someone is relatively healthy\nAnd they go into the thinking that they can do it or they're still side effects and dangers they need to be aware of\nI mean the side effects are overall positive mood more energy um as far as uh dangers again I I mean I I have a friend who's a ... a a would go to Indian and um\nHe says I'm really the rule is if you wouldn't take a macro does\nDon't take a micro does so I Would say that the the danger is really up to each individual but physiologically are taking them micro dose if you don't have any hard issues or or um or any mental ailments or anything I mean it's I mean drinking a beer is far more harmful for your in fact taking a sip of beer is more harmful\nFor really so you ... million a\nA suicide the mushrooms are actually one of the safest\nFor for you know in fact taking a sip of beer is more harmful\nReally so you ... you know a million a\nA suicide the mushrooms are actually one of the safest\nThings as far as these these substances are concerned [laughter] your body actually goes through more physiological stress running around the block three times than it does if you take even a macro dose of mushrooms so leg or do the snow I mean it at least so far\nUm there there hasn't been any reports that I've looked at the literature I've looked at the medical literature\nAnd there isn't anything there yet as far as a harmful side effects are for those of sound mind and body\nAnd in your situation you've had nothing but good side effects\n[noise] oh yeah I mean doing this I finished two books this year and my partner and I are about two and a Guinness world record just from you know using these ... magic techniques um I also\nAh ... sometimes with depression and I gotta I gotta tell you the only thing that's actually helped with it has been Michael do some mushrooms\nTell us about the uh the Guinness record you working on\nShore so uh two years ago I um when I was on tour for my first book the which is right and then I decided to make a large tentacle over the entire United States and by doing a different magical rituals and the five points of the star that\nMake up the pen fickle and I submitted that's again is for the the largest a magical ritual ever performed\nAnd they really liked it they just said you don't have enough evidence I was like really so they said yeah we don't we there's not enough here for you to say that you actually did this so I said okay so now we actually just got back two weeks ago while my partner and I\nAnd I'm so she filled the whole thing and er at each of the stops where I've performed the five rituals we invited whoever wanted to call them to join and I brought a a a a book for everyone to sign and that book is going to be submitted to ... along with the\nThe video footage and photographs and um [noise] so\nAs far as what the actual spell is it's based off a capitalistic\nA principle known as the natural law of governance or the natural of government stays very quick I'm simply that we are all born onto this land and between the land and ourselves there are three other points besides lead and ourselves so what I mean by this is there is your land\nThere's your community there's your friends there's your family and there's yourself and the idea behind this is if you serve yourself your friends your family or your community and your land in a positive way you will receive that positivity in kind\nYou mentioned your partner that would be eaten Woodruff\nYes yes ... who is the head of symptoms like a daily uh uh uh over here in Portland one of the largest a psychedelic meet up groups in the area\nOf Bruce you you nailed it perfectly it's definitely the engines and I'm Glad to see when I started writing\nUm ... mystery traditions grew out of my earlier books which has always meant and what happened was I as I was looking at in these old records I Do mostly I looked at primary sources mostly\nUm and as I was looking through them I found that there were people were using\nYou know things like cannabis and men Drake in vain and mushrooms for ways that weren't necessarily end the agenda and the origin meaning generating divinity inside yourself so some people were actually generating divinity he's\nOutside themselves in the sense that they would be invoking angels or invoking goddesses or invoking God's or even today I mean I have friends that eat mushrooms and go you know hunting for UFOs you know\nSo they're they're they're generating these higher being outside of themselves not inside themselves so I didn't feel that the term in the region applied so according to the word\nEcstasy or Jim generating divinity from outside the self and that's just one of many or about four or five the uh gyms there's another one\nUm [noise] so we most people would agree that a psychedelic enhanced creativity and if you don't agree with that that's fine you are just wrong [noise] but uh as as odd as that is there's actually no word for that so\nSome hands creativity and if you don't agree with that that's fine you were just wrong [noise] but uh as as odd as that is there's actually no word for that so I coined the term poet Egyptian poet a gym means using psychedelic for creative endeavors and that's another one of the the engines\nTom let's talk about the ancient pagan how exactly did they use psychedelic plants what have you been able to find in your research\nOh wow so many different ways are are you referring to a pagan magic in a pagan magic or pagan spirituality and religion because we'd have to differentiate the two\nI think I'd probably be referring to spirituality and really one\nSure so ah let's go back to another the agenda uh one that I call and miss the agenda which is generating mystery generating in a cult understanding of the person giving somebody a substance so that they understand the deeper meaning\nOf some myth for example uh so we would look at the rights of the loose is the the famous writes if he loses where these psychedelic beverage was the ... tree\nAnd the the whole point behind the rights if he loses was for you to have a vision of perception a\nRising from the dead and so that would be one way people used um the the things for spirituality and the entire world another way also within the midst of your general rubric\nPeople would sometimes just to attend plays that they knew were plays they weren't expecting you know some kind of vision of a God is rising uh there's a great um accounts by a guy named ... who was visiting her ... and he goes to the temple of heroin\nAnd actually writes an account of this and I write about it in the book and which seems as if the the ... and the priest we're we're\nUsing cannabis in these temples to get people nice and high and then they would put on a theater production of a a struggle um between a I'm a heroin and ... the whole idea was that there was a lake within the temple there so I'm like a human made lake\nAnd um there were sacred fishing this lake and part of the play we really have it in fragments so we don't really know what was going on but ... had to see the fish before the zoo stupid or else all the people in the congregation would die so spoiler alert ... always sees the fish first\nAnd then she would dive into the water and be reborn as a seat to us and that was another thing that people just did in the world that involves psychoactive in this case Canada\nSo you said the actors were the ones using the cannabis right before they performed\nWill be um the the congregants the the the people that were going to watch\nOther people when when ... says okay you have yeah to the performers were not under the influence\nWe don't know they very well could have been yeah it's it's\nPossible yeah I mean that there's that that's you know actors taking substances\nIs not an uncommon thing though we're you know we we we just don't\nKnow I mean it would it would be odd if they did in ... but perhaps they did and we don't know again where you're with the ancient world you're always dealing with fragments intimately or at least most of the time for\nNow is not just the ancient pagan using psychedelic plants my understanding is that this was also done by the ancient Christian how did they use these plants\nSo the the Christian two kinds of psychoactive were brought into Christianity through uh Judaism uh one was manned Drake which appears in ah the Old Testament are actually twice and um [noise]\nOf Judaism uh one was men Drake which appears in the Old Testament are actually twice and um\nThe other is cannabis which in the Bible is part of the holy annoying thing oil now in our bottom murder excuse me modern Bible it says cow in this that's the translation but in the the original languages can of ... which is kind of this ah one of the the um\nExcellent things about candidates and candidates records in the ancient world is that pretty much all over the Mediterranean\nCandidates was more or less called the same thing it was some kind of kind of whether it was kind of this\nKind of bull ... it was some kind of kind of sound whereas with other substances I mean depending on location different people call things different things are in in Greece are men drink was Madrigal aura but in Palestine it was called\nBy us so I'm Sorry well no that's something that you would go rent it\nOut so um so that's one of the things that that I was saying is good about cannabis again we also have um\nThe account of her out of this as well among the ... ah when they would do their funeral rites when they're king died a we have the uh the travel log of\nPolicy on is called geography of Greece where he talks about the worshipers of heroin using cannabis in their ceremonies to hire a um we don't know how they use them like ...\nAnd the agenda missed the ... ah but we do know they were using ... because a policy on is called the the the urban question a stereotype a stereotype as the ancient Greek word for cannabis it means little star because they thought that the cannabis leaves\nYou know the seven we categorically they thought they look like little stars [laughter] so that's how we know that policy on us was referring to Canada and that's also how we know that I'll Lucian is talking about a candidate is when he's in the temple of hair a at a higher up was\nYou'd mentioned men drink a couple of times this this is a a a plant tell us more about that because I've not heard of it before\n[noise] sure so uh men Drake is one of the ... plants are along with him being a de tour rebel Donna it's the cousin of the potato tobacco and eggplants\nAnd it um [noise] they're really volatile the solar ... plans because lower doses you'll get kind of a nice high off is it\nA slightly higher doses that you're going to be stumbling around like your drink way too much and you're going to fall eventually into a deep and Lucy dream state\nVery vivid imagery and the dreams and much higher doses than that you're you're going to kill yourself so people probably should stay away from uh things like the ... plants I'm as often a fond of saying stick to the safe\nIllegal stuff lightened plush rooms and candidates in some places are the sole nations plans are very I mean I work with them I've been working with them since two thousand five and I mean the first time I inhaled a man's rate and hadn't been I almost killed myself so just as a warning\nTo your listeners you know what we're talking about here the power of these things now I'm Thirteen Years later that I've been working with it in building up my tolerance over time I can take a dose of Maine Drake that would kill a person but I'll have them in the ... experience with it\nBut it's a slow arduous process and I would recommend your listeners nuts going anywhere near ...\nAre good to know our guest is Tom tom is a psychedelic historian an educator he has written a
