I just wanted to ask you briefly about a circus or Arthur Conan Doyle because they were Harry and and he were were good friends and yet\nA door oil was a prominent spiritual is so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual is and yet he's good friend uh and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly out and find in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there is a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as and they had a friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years\nAnd I think the friendship came about through fame just fan crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it\nUm but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them\nThat got so much that they did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a [noise] what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where she claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing um and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact\nAnd that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI was you sort of outed or in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes I started to talk over your um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in ... would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coded method that that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of can words and the tenth word is actually a phrase in\nEach word corresponds to a number number one through can and number can can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry and best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married\nThey would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ... all I Would have to laugh too did you find the coin\nAnd they these were rich and pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work the\nPray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight\nAnd so it has a natural them is to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins at best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty eight\nAnd because she would say she's communicating to invariably using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the U.S secret code emitted so so that he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend that they have a way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases pray answer say now ... please speak quickly look be quick\nAnd as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical dot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry Hi and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this call because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book is all already published in a book this is no big\nDeal well I thought you know I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within the book but they wouldn't say the name\nOf the book either people were saying it's on page da da da da da da da da da and then I finally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised\nTo find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all of the twenty five cents they\nWould move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out in eighty five year old book I couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I scanned the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside that it'll show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about those can words and\nHow it's used to form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book\nAnd download see I hear Eisen bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers\nHow clever coating method works to form these words that they use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coated word rose about that the secret message would impose the word to leave and the actual\nSecret ten word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone\nIt's a close personal friend of Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why it was important for you to point out\nThat this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini a and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the sale\nAnd and uh we should back up and explain that aren't Houdini deathbed in Detroit and one of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that ... I'm a skeptic I I I'm going to bunker I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message\nTo bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contacted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he hounded for get in touch with best\nWell I'll put an ad in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was a reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry died [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and\nHarry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in this on putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul or spirit was surviving gap and so this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither ... nor Arthur forward pursued this anymore they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford\nWas well aware of Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nHer vitamins and enzymes replace the nutrients cooked out most commercial dark boots\nTake all those that I did not up all night scratching his shutting is minimal and it is such a pleasure have my calm relaxed non shedding how the back and I have to think diner fight for that\nDon't let your dog itch scratch stink or shed like crazy come to China for help\nEight five night for two weeks one thousand eight five nine four to eight one thousand I N o v I T E [laughter]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThomas resentful my guess the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the essay we're discussing\nA Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that time is tight Thomas so let's get to the other say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her\nA so so what happens\nHum Arthur Ford shows up and he Arthur Ford usually works the spirit name Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world communicates or physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more\nAny and this ability for the spirit world to communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened and they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where Harry would work with Beth the same way they worked\nWhen they were on stage and use her as an assistant and\nAnd have her um well he was very poetic with theory very at times very touching and romantic and there were statements like throw the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this ten key words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that best as a nickname\nThat Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song\nRight around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring\nAnd so have you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe and it really really\nTouched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her and\nDid anyone noted does anyone know did or the Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best there was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends\nSo I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on this kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have known that\nHe referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of those other\n... and and again he just he he didn't of of forward through his spirit guide Fletcher does just that showed the word believe they used\nThe secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly looking be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe\nYes yes and um\nAnd she declared easy access she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on set off this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and so that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary I\nWish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence given to me by Arthur Ford is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it's signed by not only herb it's three witnesses one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was a success that had happened\nI think\nAnd she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was the success that it happened\n[noise] [laughter] yeah I think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around ... fourteen months after that there is a hard switch where she suddenly started to do now denounced that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever\nThat this was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New York graph or we Rafik rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but those are\nThe ones name but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but there is hiding somewhere they're going to witness this exchange\nWell the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says off I paid Mrs Houdini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] not just you know it's really funny because\nBass heard about at well as the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded\nIn a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said\nThat they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she was very clear in this letter goes on and on and I'd never seen this letter until um yesterday\nAnd it's in an article posted\nOn the website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nThis was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the New York evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was very supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the\nLetter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity you know I'm just telling you I was no party Danny fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he confessed\nAnd then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at all\nRight however at some point mess Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way\nMy family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in your communication you know and so and I think that this stuff stirred and she was tired of being ridiculed by your friends being labeled a nut\nAnd so and I think that this fester and\nShe was tired of being ridiculed by your friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sand and twenty nine was she re camping and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award a reward the ten thousand dollar prize to any one to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting\nTo yeah because you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford\nHe could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer\nWell that sounds you know pretty\nAnd the live feed option let's check in from anywhere using blinked smartphone app so you know when your kids get home from school they'll contracts you know subscriptions totally affordable and blink works with Alexa\nBlinked cameras systems are back in stock and right now they're Fifteen Percent off that's right Fifteen Percent of all security cameras\nVisit blink protected dot com slash radio for offer details that's blink protect dot com slash radio is an Amazon company limited time offered terms and conditions apply\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments at Quicken Loans we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty it's called ... and here's how it works\nWith the rate shield you can lock your interest rate while you shop for a new home so afraid to go up you don't have to worry and here's the best part if rates go down you get the lower rate with ratio we really have you covered\nHere are more reasons why you want to work with America's largest mortgage lender for eight years in a row now JD power has rank Quicken Loans highest in the nation and customer satisfaction for primary mortgage rich nation and for the fifth year in a row they've also ranked is highest in the nation for mortgage servicing rate shield\nAnother way we can save your money on your mortgage calls today at eight hundred quicken or go to rocket mortgage dot com\nBasin right and what you said in comparison to public records racial approval only about thirty thirty approaches transactions ... information and conditions equal housing lender licensing office he said and unless there were thirty thirty additional conditions are actually just may apply\nOn from the justice of heart ... studios ... north Las Vegas ...

I I think of George Bush senior trying to buy stocks in Kmart back in the ... member that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man and there was a famous\nTV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's funny how they live amongst us but they have no idea what the hell were about it's incredible really the ultra rich off during the cleaning and people who just hit and they don't have any idea about us or what we do you know and sometimes I Wonder if they really want to but it's not\nAll right it's time to do is it's like they lived in the cloud\nSometimes I Wonder if they really want to but it's not just days right\nAll right it's a case of the time to be with\nIt's like they lived in the clouds might make you happy not contracted polio uh he ... he may not have been well he may have been president but it's certainly changed the trajectory of\nHis life as you would imagine it would but also his politics talk to me about how polio affected FDR more than just physically\nWell I'll tell you what this is where I I gained a lot of a lot of respect\nBut ah if I was not necessarily you know the ... and I'm not much of socialist personal but you know when somebody comes down with will end compiled relatives because we're all they can leave her head and they fight their way back using sure will um installing\n... with all of that so they can use their arms and then dragging your body will try and get themselves will walk every day and the ... when that happened to him you know the our ways uh\nStarted to you know obviously you know we'll be non treatments came in on I'm going to actually work each day that you identify with people who are suffering and you need it loses a gigantic twice a humble pie it actually changes life\nRight I mean he he displayed you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically dragged he's he he had a hunch is Iran's but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had the bars and stalled out in front of the Roosevelt mansion and he would\nHave cash in these races and he would use crutches and he was in it's just incredible that it it you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg and easy dragging and solve it is you\nDo the parallel bars where he's exercising bombs that and then from the parallel bars the closest route ... in front of a A R\nAnd then he's turning around and dragging himself back you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops and you know I mean\nThis is talk about ironclad will you know what that was that was a was really something else or you know we\nDo want to come back that far and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm waters\nWith cheapest wage and when my children and other people with other selections and\nActually have pack his wife to identify with people in need and\nSuffering so it really changes what for sure\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we've got about five five minutes before we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me a sort of a thumbnail sketch of of his journey to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nIs truck for the White House started ... or ... Wilson\nAnd colonel colonel house actually who Woodrow Wilson was like all colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's well he didn't know that at the time if he was a it was it was a uh styling plant\nAnd um they were ... it's all in love with this communist ideal and um you know of course they didn't know anything about the only that but it was just sort of great things and\nIt was through at um ... house and I'm I'm a few hours connection with that in ...\nIt was through at a friend's house and I'm\nI'm a geologist than actually going to let him assistant secretary of the navy and from their intended to use the Roosevelt man and with the political connections in New York to a bunch of governor and then once governor I'm ... was a was a jump to the White House\nAnd he asked them to pull him out of the time when a\nEvil really some of the things that I Want it to do\n'em over want it to do but you know he was like a gang uh\nCooperate very well with with some of those were his ideas and I'm going to have to jump right to a jump right to the White House and\nYou know started a ritual he ran on tax cuts and everything and we realized that the that old isn't working you flip and when you know with a socialist onto the\nOn a you know was amazingly ... and you become like watching the suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered NPR at a time when\nA physical handicap like this was also also equated with sort of the moments of mind and how would that would I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels he made a very cooperative very sympathetic maybe it's just like today well no uh [laughter] it's like today without whether I go out with him which I'm\nSure [laughter] stab theloop hair loss of freedom he gets a free pass them\nAlong the lines between these two guys will have to talk about when you get back but uh it's it's it's a history H.

FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him and uh certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came a into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like\nFifty percent unemployment and the banking system had failed and it's just sort of paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad a president preceding Hoover had already going and of course in in the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know days we're starting to\nWhere it started oh surely you for luxuries and the country would regret it and feel with the knowledge and lovers and raised a few times\nDo we were starving children to be able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise a few taxes and put some regulations on in your that fast\nAnd ah you know so here comes FDR and he realizes there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has this has low vision of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people in or so he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of hell for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the gun route paycheck\nAnd um this was the experiment from the communists communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nHis friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're on your study or and so this is was their idea\nOf how to help the workers in the working class and it was a flood of legislation or were they\nJust basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking to Security Act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government do so we could have this cradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had you\nKnow fooled us into thinking existed new ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the ah the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\nBalance of capitalism I think you meant the I think he's a communist instead of equal limits sorry about that I hear the noise the\nPitfalls and valleys you know of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou mean if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative\nUm um actions that were enacted a\nIn in who murdered FDR and I'm just reading here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wine revenue at the creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief fact agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority act securities act\nAggregation of gold team in class homeowners lone act\nGlass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act emergency railroad transportation act and the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this really without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through I wasn't gonna boardroom buddy with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Would I\nDo I'm happy to board them with it here [laughter] so I mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that and he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it ... it\nCertainly was the same basic control he was carrying just like Stalin style and just Persia all of his enemies you know if you got in a way of style and you know you ended up dead his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either to disagree with America challenging politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worry you know there was an election coming\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know a weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great war is brewing you know he's seen lots of Europe's war was going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nAh they start to put a you know implement the second new deal and they start to realize that\nSubstantial portions of it were unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed than it was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean a tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books paid him as this wonderful magical genie of economics says he wasn't there was an economic failure people were ah they were surviving and that was about it\nThat was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services\nWhere were you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean it was it was a it was a cat a ... it was a top because atrophy\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease there's music playing the you know the the trading trading with the enemy act well\n[laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the St Louis the same thing with the with the lend lease program he was moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to defeat the axis powers\nAnd he was giving him to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there is a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started or he had to do that because he started to realize the new deal was not working so there was\nNo there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where\nHe knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and you know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries having them we have spies to our spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your have your water experiments\nAnd with the beats who rockets to get rid of the nuclear weapons to all for it to the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now I mean they were on the brain\nSo we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo in the book you argue as many as I have that that NPR New Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he did he sort of make it happen duty let it happen or what he just sort of glad it happened\nProgressive [noise] so I'm pretty good I think I can do more time and I think as we said nailed it right now the\nProgressive ... from becoming your parents but we can see if you money when

Roosevelt White House so some of the communist and the ... year\nFor the first communist that overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there\nThere were there were hundreds of them at least Fifteen high ranking officials and half the White House winnowing communist starting when Harry Dexter white all the way through the elder hush\nAnd they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he was fingered in Nineteen Ninety you know talk about Harry Hopkins is a lengthy later so don't get bored on their way is more common [laughter]\nUm the or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated it in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department [laughter] U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you one with a laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so\nI mean he was just communists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually was the HHS secretary of state he was one of the architects of the new deal it was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously\nEvery FDR couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so forth so we had to have someone fly over to talk to Stalin and so forth\nAnd uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the ah CPU essay the Communist Party United States of America which is still in existence by the way and like I mentioned that or not\nAnd how they Hopkins in down and get on famously\nHe was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help the Soviets out So Harry Hopkins famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happen okay I'll get to that in a minute\nOr he was Harry Hopkins afterwards fire afterwards was fingered\nBy a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name 'em all they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB defectors they both identified Harry Hopkins is the mysterious agent

so so the point where they he goes to the Toronto conference you know I mean that's\nInspires all around the FDR\nSo so the point where they he goes to the Toronto conference\nYou know I mean that'd be a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt meeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were er at the hands of a an odd cities weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him\nStalin right information right he had\nPlans in the post war world of taking America was have communist anyway he had plans of taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so it was a little diluted in his home in his own right but how this all happened was\nPrior to this of course this was a new ideology communism while this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does\nThis and that and you know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for well Stalin had sent invitations to um\nTo directors in Hollywood a union leaders are college professors\nHe knew the target and they would were sent invitations all expense paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and they went to a city and the city's names escaping on than it is are listed in my book\nIn the ... they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was cared for and how this working how terrific was and look at what we've done and you need to do this year country because you're you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities Tamerlan was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit anyway you had loudly\nSo it was a fictitious found that didn't exist that was made it hard work basically so they can village a Potemkin village and there you go\nUm he sends all of these people home with literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meeting our country\nInto this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you got to cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings and strength polling by style and smiling as the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy what he managed to accomplish\nAnd his wife was incredible he was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution\nAnd he ended up there just to make fun of style and he was nothing more than a he used to keep the party's journals and use the column comrade or\nWas it come Conrad index card used to call them ... used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless and the party one by one he knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm I'm Sorry I'm Len wrote that in his a quote from lens will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nWith reduction or just a pie and you have a formula you'd be crazy not to try try ... free dial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and said a key word free bottle again dial pound to five zero and see the key word free bottle method you do to raise\n... if you're considering going back to school after the following questions do you need the flexibility

...\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n... the author of who murdered FDR stays with us how you do in a steaming you hold on okay\nI Am I'm just trying to get over this story or the or the girl bake their grandfather's ashes and the cookies she wants to ... what's the ones that are gray Persian the famine in Russia under Stalin it must be really going hungry\nOr anybody you know [laughter]\nYeah well it never ceases to amaze um I just wanted to take them anything because people need to know it's what you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and a three hours is a long stretch to talk so I just want to make sure you're ah you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late so\nI'm I wanted to talk about you know so much of the post world are so much in the\nPost war world is a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your\nPain forty four when when that post war world\nWas really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon Roosevelt spraying condition\nOr and and I'm\nHappy I really didn't know what happened he just was so out of it but I mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the also conference\nAnd obviously he is is he looks like death warmed over let's seven months before that the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them um every hour as being slowly poison from within the White House and I have to be very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of\nToys and let's see we're used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but the rest of the world\nCertainly did Europe certainly some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us and you know I don't think grandpa Walton would have known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially because they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House every time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia\nTo sow his ailing legs and go on a retreat so he can mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so I\nI did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient that in\nThe tiny Marcia Eighteen days\nA Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently iffy on that or I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people actually we just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought I was interviewing the FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming\nI also thought it was all convenient that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so and when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nAnd said you know wait a minute I really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back then they actually taught history\nYou know I mean [laughter] but in the book you point out how he he doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and is a cardiologist Dr Howard grew in they were they had\nNo idea what was going on and they were doing X ray take doing all of these cats they were really clueless well\nAnd this is where you know this is where the rubber finally starting to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... himself out for us and you know he was the advance of polio and this and that in the other thing in\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre who's the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a certain sort of in general in the navy\nUm you know he was actually ours physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard ruin was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology emphasize though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled as because FDR is getting sick after meal times\nThis is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce\nHe would go normal and then it would go it would go warring out of control three ten over one Ninety five or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard\nTo every ... wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything you they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they got to this point they should look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again\n[laughter] and we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day Dr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines FDR march in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is as a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this is a dead man walking\nAnd the what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not align with the advance of polio\nThey advance they align with the advance of poisoning\nFDR as being slowly poison styling style and got him I can tell you that I'm styling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain China and the Soviet Union so they could all police there quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share of the world with I'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac with\nYou want to share of the world with I'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac with what he didn't Soviet Union of course we didn't know that that wasn't wasn't you know you can do to us until years later\nWho wants it they died that was part of the negotiations team in the U.S at ... ... on the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aids died conveniently also on the brain and your as\nWell there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about this or his name was pile Watson and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way back I Believe in that surround conference dies on this ship\nOf history real hemorrhage he gets back he being FDR he

I mean it's just it's it's incredible how we were we were there either really naive or really dumb\nRight what were the doctors in on it do you think because you know just minutes before FDR you know reach trees hadn't said I had this tremendous headache and then he collapsed\nUm I think it was his ballet and he would do would you would give is a lay out a picture of cream and some grew will or oatmeal or something and then there's ... it's been described as a glass of green liquid\nOr is that how they get it in that in that glass of Green Bay Clinton\nWas it the doctor when they connected to salad\nI you know\nLove to say I know everything about this I have no idea if the doctors were in on it I Do know that in Nineteen fifty seven Eleanor Roosevelt had was tired of hearing the swirling around Washington DC about that they are being murdered I'm definitely not the first one to come up with this\nUm and she commissioned a private investigator to\nUh the it to the bottom of this stuff so I Do know that um\nThe private investigator hit a dead end all of FDR's medical records were were stolen from a locked filing with us though so one of four people had those keys one of them was a doctor\nAnd uh it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote so the um the book being um\nOr was it was the same doctor who in Nineteen forty six wrote\nSo the um the book being um\nThe White House physician and that was a rout MRI's mcentire were they in on the murder I have absolutely no idea I I couldn't say I have to say that they had good intentions they were just a little bit little\nIgnorant maybe and and what happened to ... the Russian painter and her driver and and and um she which has been\nWell they just kind of disappeared into obscure I mean at the time or two afterwards well immediately afterwards well\nThey packed up the uh I'm a Robin and shuts off and they\nThrew loose Lucy Mercer who he was having an affair with among others um [laughter] and um they tried to get out of Warm Springs Georgia as fast as possible so in her book um her being I'm sure with off in her book she describes the plight that they took to to get away from Warm Springs Georgia\nWhich I thought was a little crazy because if it was a natural death\nUm\nYou know why I don't know why would why fleet a scene right right you know I mean if it's a natural death why still the records you know and then there's a parallel here to the FDR's or to the JFK thing actually\nUm JFK shot in Dallas they break law to bring him to a out of Dallas the autopsy should have been performed in Dallas they break law to bring him to besides the now the law was\nThe same in Nineteen sixty three it was it was a Nineteen forty five they did the same thing they broke the law removing FDR's body from Georgia bringing it to the pathologist so both you know both the JFK and FDR's body I removed illegally\nThey're both at but says though we're all kinds of fun things happen you know a lot of this besides the couldn't talk you know and and they they rushed this guy it's it's a little less than sixty nine hours from FDR's death\nTo him being guilty being buried they couldn't get this guy's body in the ground fast enough\nNo nor did by the way and no one involving\nNo autopsy no and bombing it just outraged\nHere and crazier and crazier all the way through so I mean and there's other things in history to Richard I mean take a look at 'em you know not just this I'm going to be working on Princess Diana coming up next but there\nAre other presidents in history who I also believe in them or that they gloss over\nUm Warren Harding Warren Harding\nWas it was that was obvious this guy was murdered and there's another one that we thought about but as far as FDR's concern\nI mean the the [laughter] the information in my head just exploded when I started digging and digging and digging and it's still it's still boggles my mind and you know the book is going to publish for a little while now and I still even after the book is one published you know I'll find a new fact and go wow I should have put that in the book\nI mean it's the volume three perhaps uh let me get the calls here ah and he's an Alabama on the wild card line any good morning locked ...\nThank you Steve I'm calling to ask you about ... music ... y ... garden party she cannot aunt who work at the state department and managed remind now\nI'd also like me can experience with the blood dancer strap from my grandmother which was watering eight ... hand\nSo like ... cents experience with the blood dinner for ... from my grandmother which was watering it comes to ten things all over it looked like Bruce ...\nIs it causes bleeding all in the body this month and over and it came time to name your Islam\nThere you go but you don't use it wasn't a warfare and with Roosevelt because that would have been too quick\n[noise] yeah it was it wasn't people around him they were disposing of with the war for him because\nAnd she's right she's right I mean since the blood out to to the point where if you touch a person they'll get you know either their their brains will either believe or they'll have an ... or something real image and they'll also and of course I'm a doctor but my parents were both on it they're both on a variety of\nBlows are so right in my late father was as well sure not necessarily cause ... thanks for calling on\nThank you oh let's go back in the wild card line is it my New York\nMy hide their good morning ah okay\nAs quick a sleep oughta and I'll listen over they at\nFirst a look for I heard um I'm a gentleman on the air I heard ... who also believes that FDR with was limited and I'd like to know if he is familiar with him and his theory around it\nA second ... and what is it the grasses so he would be someone that would talk about the new deal a new deals\nAs I'm ah doing the right thing around that that that awful so called Great Depression\nAnd so I like his thoughts on that and last Les ... about both of direction connection and it's a both FDR and it's a current stable genius if you will and the White House\nIs saying somewhat different because ah with the current administration they seem to have more to do with leading up to even how he wound up as president and of course the money that he had to go to encounter rush in Saudi Arabia\nI like him to elaborate on ... and and of course the odd that do see a fifty fifty sad you know we know that he has a public liberties and\nWell my I had if I could just jump in here because we're not talking about Trump I think if you have to put words in your mouth but I think you were being kind of facetious\nOr above the Russian connection with Trump but let's just stick to FDR where we can do a whole show perhaps another time on on the Russian dusty and so forth but and you're right website is hardly a big fan of FDR no Webster a little bit and have dinner with him and and you waxes on\nAbout the new deal I'm obviously Steve you're you're not a fan did you have anything to add\nUh no I don't know the man I Would love to meet him sometime uh as far as the new deal I think it was probably the right thing at the time I think it was an experiment I don't think anybody knew how it was going to go 'cause I Want it to my knowledge there's never been done before so I mean it\nI have no doubt that they thought at the time it was a really good thing it helps a lot of people um it just wasn't along sustaining campaign so\nFar as the Russians in the current administration yeah I was going to be in a little facetious as to how how everyone is ... whole history you kind of repeats itself what kind of doesn't you know um it's it's amazing how\nWe have the [laughter] we're we're right back in the same thing we have another red scare them in the country and it's really it's really something ... and he would he would really enjoy those sort of thing\nSeeing where you have another red scare and in the country it's really it's really something else away ... you know it would it would really enjoy those rising\nRight so I think that point they are making there was that the the Russian connection during FDR's time was overt uh and today it's I guess you would to coin a phrase from ah CNN it's nothing burger\nRight I mean if I mean if they ever prove it with Trump which I don't know if they're ever going to um they may I don't know I'm not privy to that information but it's it's just interesting how\nHow how ... who is rich another red scare it's starting to repeat itself over again and here we are Seventy some odd years passed its funny which is how history repeats itself becomes relevant actually a very interesting book I think you'll like it ...\nWe will ah we're heading into a break here at the er the bottom of the hour and then we will get to a more calls people are lined up in Chicago Pennsylvania Gulfport, Mississippi San Pedro California Sioux Falls South Dakota we'll get to as many of you as we\n\n\nWelcome back allows the beanie they are lined up and ready to speak with you so let's try and move quickly let's go to the wild card line yet again John in Long Beach California John good morning\nThanks for having me real quick to think\nWind or if you look at a at Roosevelt a Nineteen forty four you look so bad I have a hard time thing that they had to kill him because he was going to die anyway that's why they got rid of Henry Wallace may trigger the bike for the night before or campaign 'cause they didn't think you know the lip\nSecond of all I don't I've read up on this or I was fascinated with tall and how I got away with all that stuff but Roosevelt died ... somebody to look at Roosevelt body currently to make sure that uh let's see if he was he was calling because I'm Stalin did a lot of that\nAnd I think he will do for the story was that he was afraid of ... he wanted Roosevelt Web cookie rake them over the cold that the that Iran and uh you know and all that and got the deal he was afraid of but ... I I Can't buy the fact that ah that stall and one of the debt I I think he did not want to I wanted to live longer they pop like that's just my\nMy take on it interesting John ... such a bad shape you're going to die anyway I think All right Steven you want to reply\n[noise] um\nI you know there's a lot of people who read up on things and to the Victor goes the spoils okay a lot of the things that we've been told 'em have been slanted okay\nI'm not suggesting that what you said has been he looks so bad in Nineteen forty four that was after almost two years of being poisoned systematically poison that's why he looked so bad in Nineteen forty four this wasn't from the advance of polio\nAnd it spills out very very plainly in my book so it's a it's an interesting time in history it was an awful lot of people who research this and I learned from every one of them I'm not gonna sit here and professional every little angle that's for sure\nBut um as far as now in style in one of the rule the world he didn't he didn't have any interest in sharing anything with FDR so if he sent something to look in the ... in the end of the coughing or sent someone to verify what was going on he was already being where the death was already verified from the two Russians that were in front of him when he died\nSo if if indeed that happened and it may have I'm not suggesting it didn't if indeed that had happened\nIt was probably just so he could uh you know get recognition of the fact that we weren't giving them some sort of falls propaganda\nHi John thank you for that interesting points there ah let's see how to James in Philadelphia Hi James good morning welcome to coast to coast\nThank you Richard uh but my guess for me and my question for Mr things just are banning it in your research physical or did you come across all anything about this is just a spotted an attempted coup against so Roosevelt in the thirties and that\nUh if it did happen if you came across it how close was it a shoe happening and that it costs us ... uh it was a exposed by an army general ... butler and that one of the people involved was ah I think was Garth or\nDid you come across anything about the coup how if and if it's truly how posted it come happening\nOr if it if it did happen if there was an attempted\nCoup against Roosevelt\nSomething that you discussed in the book like a ...\nA James thanks for calling and I did run run into that information that it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did\nInformation that it was after the book was published so you won't find that information in there I thought it was fascinating when I did run across it didn't make the book I'm Sorry I Wish it did um and ... yeah I don't really I don't know I guess that people say a lot of things I don't know how true that really is\nWith the amount of people who are around Roosevelt who didn't like him for multiple reasons\nI'm from you know suppressing the uh the the capitalist to holding off as as long as he did it wouldn't it wouldn't surprise me\nBut I mean as far as as far as that's concerned I don't have any I don't have any great knowledge into that I discovered it after the book but I did run into it so thanks for your call and sorry I couldn't be much out there like I said I I I I Will be lying if I said I felt that I knew everything\n[laughter] All right James thank you for that way and he's in Chicago Wayne good morning welcome to cost\nYou

[noise]\nAlso last night\nOr should I say earlier this morning during the open line segment a number of callers shared their near death experiences or glimpses\nOf an afterlife tonight in our one I'm revisiting the topic of the afterlife this time and alleged after death communication involving the great American magician escape artist\nHarry Houdini Houdini and his wife best were fears the bunkers of psyche ability mediums and the spiritual this movement in fact Houdini wrote several books exposing fake mediums and their fraudulent methods\nHoudini of course died of a ruptured appendix on October the thirty first Nineteen twenty six Halloween four days after receiving for unexpected punches to his abdomen by McGill University student backstage at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there\nOn his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors\nAge at the princess theater in Montreal Canadian connection there on his deathbed Houdini allegedly told doctors that despite being a skeptic of after death communication if he were able to get a message to his beloved wide best he would do so\nThen more than two years after his death his wife best attended the sands\nConducted by medium psychic Arthur for during which for allegedly channel the message from Harry using a secret coded message previously agreed to by Harry and bass\nInitially best stated publicly and assigned in witness testimony that she believed Terry Haddon fact communicated to her from the grave\nLater however she recanted and stated publicly that no Harry had not communicated to er during the playoffs despite this best continue to hold highly publicized San says in New York every Halloween on the anniversary of Harry's death for the next ten years\nNothing on Henry you know I mean he didn't have any kind of reason to go there or do anything\nRight right I thought it would you I just wanted to ask you about briefly about the circle is their Arthur Conan Doyle because they were ... and he were were good friends and yeah it's\nA joy was a prominent spiritual and so how did that how did that friendship survive as the fact that Harry was such an avowed to bunker didn't have time for spiritual and yet he's good friend and his wife ah we're both very much into spiritualism movement\nYes yes the spirit was movement is not exactly a and defining in some kind of permanent structure you know you can't say there's a leader but a lot of people did look to the oil as the leader of the spiritual as a matter of friendship starting in around Nineteen twenty for about two years and\nI think the friendship came about through fame just fame crossing pass and hey how are you and they enjoy the fact that they had a different perspective and they talked about it um but eventually um there was a little bit of a discord between them that got so much that\nThey did break off their friendship after a couple of years it was the oil's wife who gave a I think it was a what do you call it a automatic writing kind of reading for Harry where\nShe claims that he brought she bought through Harry's mother\nAnd Harry's mother the spirit of Harry's mother plays an important part in this whole thing\nUm and Harry was supposedly moved but he declined to acknowledge any real evidence that there was contact and that kind of upset the oil and his wife and that was the beginning of the tension so anyway\nI sort of outed or in public didn't need any out her ... yeah\nYes yes I started to talk over your um some of this play out through the newspaper which is an awkward way to have a conversation\nNow no part of this debunking that that uh Harry and Bess engaged in would be to sort of demonstrate I guess the audience is how it works so they would sort of do their own\nSort of photo psychic act or on stage and I don't know if they didn't explain to the audience you know how they were being deceived but they had this\nSecret coated method that that Harry and best could communicate with each other in order to sort of demonstrate how psychics may may be pulling these scams off can you explain the secret Cody methods\nI think we should touch on that a little bit I don't want to go into it too much but I'm here's one way to uh anybody that's interested in this it's all explained in the essay quite clearly there is a list of ten words\nAnd the tenth word is actually a phrase in each word corresponds to a number number one through can and number ten can also be taken to be zero and so this was used to point most commonly\nTo the date on a coin so that's how the trick would normally work when Harry best first met and Eighteen Ninety four that's when they got married they would do this little trick where they would have someone volunteer they'd reaching their pocket ...\nWhat is the last two digits on the coastline and they these were rich\nAnd pray answer say now tell and so forth these words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know\nThese words would be correlated to a number and so that would work these words into an easy sent tens like quickly Harry I Know you can do this and that would be number eight and so it has a natural miss to it and yet there's some information in there you see what I mean\nRight so if the coins the best held in her hand was a let's say Eighteen eighty age\nAnd because she would say she's communicating doing verbal using these code words and she said quickly quickly is corresponds with a number eight it's the eight eight were in in the secret code emitted so he knew that one of the numbers was age\nRight and then she might use quickly again so that would be the same number right mix size right okay\nAnd I don't want to go into the details and how it can be used to construct words rather than just\nNumbers but it can you know of course we have twenty six letters and the alphabet so you got to use a pair of words at times to get to the letters that are passing and pretend but the way of doing that and that's what was used to make this code\nSo they would have had to memorize they'd have to memorize those ten words or phrases praying or say now ... please speak quickly look be quick and as you say all of this can be found in the essay let me just give people the website if they want to follow along at home as we say infinitely mystical\nDot com infinitely mystical dot com is the website where Houdini afterlife experiment did it work the essays posted there sorry and\nThere's a link on the coast to coast now let's talk about this call because after the message was delivered to bath and she said that it works somebody quickly said hey this was all in a book\nIs all already published in a book this is no big deal well\nI thought I had read this on line a number of times someone would say within a book but they wouldn't say the name of the book out of the people were saying it's on page da da da da di ... crazy and then I\nFinally found someone who said the name of the book and I thought you know I'm going to look in the Santa Barbara county library and see if that book is there and I was so surprised\nTo find out that it was in northern Santa Barbara county\nAnd for all twenty five cents they\nWould move that book down to the downtown Santa Barbara library and I could go in there and check it out an eighty five year old book I couldn't believe it so I got the book\nAnd I stand the relevant pages of this book and if you're interested just follow that may not say there's a link inside there to show you scan of this book and so that book does talk about those ten words\nAnd how it's used to form numbers but not out a form we're\nSo that's not in the book in fact there are a number of important things that are not in the book and um let's see I hear some bullet points about this that the code can be used to form words not just numbers how clever coating method works to form these words that\nThey use this code in the afterlife experiment that the secret message would start with the onion coated word rose about that the secret message within code the word the leave and the actual secret can word message none of that was in the book and the person who claimed that it was in the book\nThis is important to ask who this is he also was a famous magician and he's a close personal friend Harry Houdini so in this person says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believe that for\nPerson says ah it's not a trick it's in the book everyone's you took him at his word did not look into the book and just believed that Ford was a fraud without looking into it anymore\nOkay we need to back up a little bit because we need to introduce a Ford and and why was important for you to point out that this secret coded message was sort of explain in another book by Houdini or about Houdini\nA and therefore it may have been possible for someone to know about that because now we get into the sale and and uh we should back up and explain that on Houdini deathbed in Detroit\nOne of the last things he told doctors allegedly I don't know if this was actually true but allegedly told them that I'm a skeptic I ... I don't believe in an afterlife but if there's any way I can get a message to bass I Will try\nAnd then she has contracted basses several years later correct by an Arthur Ford how did he how did for get in touch with best\nWell outputs are not in just a minute but I just want to point out that I think that this worked\nBecause bass and Harry loved each other so much I think that's really important to point out now science runs these experiments checking into reality as if it's a heartless machine and I think it's really important for us\nTo think about how well we love one another and ... we are for kindness and compassion and we're not involved in a big giant heartless machine\nSo back to your question\nUm Ford was reasonably successful psychic and he had clients that would come to him and ask him questions and in one of these sessions in Nineteen twenty eight I think it's about I think it's about Fifteen months after Harry die [noise]\nOne of his clients is getting a reading and Harry's mother the spirit she had already passed the spirit of Harry Harry mother intrude into the session and in his mind putting the word forgive and all capital letters putting in a letter and sending it to death\nWell that gets this letter and she responds in writing is the understanding I have\nAnd she says it's too bad this came after Harry died because of this is the word that he was looking for from his mother to show him that his mother's soul were spirit was surviving gap and says this got\nHer attention but what's really interesting is that neither best Houdini nor Arthur forward pursued this any more they didn't want to pursue Arthur Ford was well aware\nOf Houdini reputation and how strongly he was pushing back against the mediums and he\nMorning noon or night cardio mobile there to take on limited medical great EKG\nGo ahead and joined the peace of mind\nFor your time today for just Ninety nine dollars and then the cardio dot com that's K. A. R. D. I. A. dot com [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nThomas resentful my gas the author of living the paradox of enlightenment and the the an essay we're discussing a Houdini afterlife experiment did it work and that is posted up at the coast to coast am dot com website and Thomas's website as well infinitely mystical\nDot com that time is tight Thomas so let's get to the to say on a at a best his house in January of Nineteen twenty nine and a Arthur Ford is there this is the the medium would reached out to her a so so what happens\n[noise] um\nThere for it shows up and he either for the spirit name Fletcher and Fletcher is in touch with Houdini and this ability for the spirit world communicate to our physical world\nIs a little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also press\nA little bit tricky to navigate and so sometimes spirits need a little more help with this and apparently Houdini mother the spirit of his mother was also present to make this all happened\nAnd they were able to make it kind of a um like a show or very theatrical show where hey would work with best the same way they worked when they were on stage and use her as an assistant and\nAnd have her um well he was very poetic with are very at times very touching and romantic and there were statements like throw in the curtain and all of this but what they did was they put this pen key words on the table and then they coated them\nAnd after it was decoded\nThe message I'll tell it and just a minute but first I Want to explain that best as a nickname\nThat Harry used for her was Roosevelt and this came about through a popular song\nRight around the time when they got married and this song had a little bit or perhaps more of this song I'm inside her wedding ring and so\nHave you called her Roosevelt and so the message once it was decoded was Roosevelt believe and it really really touched bass and she was very very strong and clear and her language that her husband had spoken to her\nAnd did anyone noted does anyone know Arthur Ford no that Roosevelt was the pen name for best or was this common knowledge\nIt might have been known throughout the close friends\nUm [noise] so I really can't say about that there's a story going around that I read just the other day on the Internet 'cause that's trying to brush up on his kind of set up someone said that uh there was a big\nRomance between Arthur Ford and bass who is Twenty years older than he and he saw her wedding ring and saw the inside of it and saw where it said Roosevelt and blah blah blah\nI just don't find this credible so I won't go into it but um yeah there are people that say that it's quite possible that they would have\nKnown that he referred to as Roosevelt but the believe is actually came through the decoding of of other ...\nAnd again he just he he didn't of of Ford through his spirit guide Fletcher ... just didn't show the word believe they used\nThe secret coating message that we had mentioned earlier using those keywords pray answer say now tell please speak quickly look can be quick in and these all windy coded spelled out the message which began with Roosevelt and and believe yes\nYes and um\nShe declared the success she declared it a success correct\nAbsolutely and I'm In fact the very next day and in fact I think this was written in another newspaper by someone who is president to say on said oh this is a lot of nonsense that wasn't true and and\nSo that's that's why her statement says regardless of any statements made to the contrary I Wish to declare that the message in its entirety and in the agreed upon sequence\nGiven to me by her through forward is the correct message prearrange between Mr Houdini and myself and then it signed by not only her but three witness is one of them as a representative of the United press\nAnother one is one of her lifelong friends and another one is someone from Scientific American\nAnd these this this letter was reprinted in the New York times and she gave an interview to the times again confirming that that this was the success that it happened\nI think so in effect of the newspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support\nHappened [noise] [laughter] yeah I think so in effect of the\nNewspaper articles that I was reading you could clearly see here in support for a good while and then around ... fourteen months after this there's a hard switch where she suddenly started to do now denounce that anything was valid that there was any evidence whatsoever that\nThis was a genuine contact so it's it's quite shocking um\nBut before that before she sort of recanted there was another a reporter with a ... a either a magazine or a newspaper called the New Yorker graph or we graphic rather than your graphic and tell me about this reporter ... is it re Jew Jew Ari I Can't pronounce the name but those are the ones\nName but I think the first name as R. E. A. and I think it's pronounced ... right um she had an apartment and she invited Arthur forward over to visit her and she was going to interview him\nAnd she had some friends hiding I don't know where they're hiding in the closet but they're hiding somewhere and they're going to witness this exchange well the person that shows up is not really author Fort it's someone that's been paid to in person ate Arthur Ford and he shows up and he says off I paid Mrs\nHoudini some money she gave me the code I'm just here to tell you the truth [laughter] I just you know it's really funny because bats heard about at well as the reporter wrote this up\nAnd so bass responded\nIn a letter 'em to that same paper where she just completely denies it there she's been a party of fraud in any way and if Arthur Ford said\nThat they were in cahoots he's a liar I mean she's very clear in this letter goes on and on and I had never seen this letter until um yesterday and it's in an article posted\nOn the website and the author's name is Greg new Kirk I'm so it's\nYou know and this was written to Walter windshield the great Walter ...\nThat's what I thought I had read that there was a letter written to watch Walter ritual and he was um yes the social they go to guy you know and um but this\nKind of made it look like it was a letter written to this um the Newark evening graphic but it doesn't matter there may have been two letters but she was\nVery supportive and these these were supposed to be private letters the letter starts off saying this letter is not for publicity I Do not need publicity\nYou know I'm just telling you I was no party to any fraud you know but anyway um there's a number of things like this where it looks like someone saying aha we've got prove there's fraud he can fast\nAnd then it's like yeah but that wasn't him his lawyer said he was somewhere else at the time\nSo Arthur Ford didn't go to this meeting with this reporter at All right\nHowever at some point mess Houdini further uh money's the water because although she has been insisting and insisting that had happened then she does an abrupt about face\nYes and you know in the very first days after the message happened\nIn one of the newspaper articles I read something where she says oh by the way my family and friends they don't buy this you know they don't believe in their communication you know and so and I think that this fester and\nShe was tired of being ridiculed by her friends being labeled and not um and I think she just sold it and said you know what I'm\nOf being ridiculed by your friends\nBeing labeled and not um and I think she just told and said you know what I'm ... I'm I'm going to go back to my friends I Want them to access accept me um and she even said things like\nIf anyone says they get in touch with me after my death to know that it's false I Will not try to get in touch with anyone [noise]\nUm so this also muddy the water\nAnd and when I mean how long after the sand and twenty nine was she recanted and changing their position\nI think it was about fourteen month\nFourteen months and but also she had at some point she had offered up a an award reward ten thousand dollar prize to allow anyone to ten thousand but and then she refused to pay for it so we really interesting to yeah\nBecause you know if he really wasn't boots with Arthur Ford\nHe could have done this much more gracefully she basically said hey look I'm not paying because a couple of weeks before this happened I retracted the offer\nWell that sounds you know pretty pretty iffy whereas if they were in cahoots he could've said I'm so happy that she is so generous but I don't want my spiritual progress\nIf the historical West is what you want health go it someplace for you visit the northeastern Nevada museum that California Trail interpreted center\nThe western ... center or the new cowboy arts and gear museum\nGreat dining hotel options make your plans to visit I Would go now for more information visit explore El Loco dot com for all our community and event information\nThat's explore El Loco dot com [noise]\nThat method sponsored by the ...\nConvention and visitors authority aired in cooperation with the Nevada broadcasters association and this\nFrom the justice to heart ... studios G.

know use your guest host Richard series [laughter] come and do you live from coast to Toronto, Canada affiliate ended up radio news ... say hello on\nTwitter at Richard Sayre etch Eddie Floyd people get it together or it was April Nineteen forty five and the end of the war in Europe was insight as the allies armies press their invasion into the German heartland\nIn Washington President Roosevelt health had noticeably deteriorated his Ashton gray complex and physical weakness raised concerns for his health among friends family and associates the president needed Iraq the chance to recuperate and regain his strengths\nAccordingly president once again traveled to the little White House in Warm Springs Georgia within when an entourage of friends and relatives FDR had first visited this health spa noted for healing mineral waters Twenty one years earlier in an effort to find a relief for his paralyzed lower body\nRoosevelt look forward to two weeks of relaxation\nAt one PM on April twelfth Nineteen forty five Roosevelt sat in the living room of his cottage surrounded by friends and family as he signed letters and documents an artist stood painting his portrait at an easel nearby the conversation was widely the atmosphere congenial\nThe president turn to the artist reminded her that they had only Fifteen minutes left in the session\nSuddenly he grabbed his head complaining of a sharp pain the president was suffering a massive cerebral hemorrhage that would end his life in minutes America's longest serving president who had led the nation through the great depression and World War two was dead\nWell forget all that says ... everything you think you know about ... how FDR died is wrong Steve you bay and he joins me next on coast to coast they [noise]\nOut so he put a lot of things are with unsavory than some self marrying\nIts paws on on funding a number of Teddy Roosevelt you know that in public it was awful lot of weight so you know he was a ... benefitted from the laws will name as well so\nRight and he was also governor of New York lots of you know he was you know he was also governor of New York which is ... has always been sort of a stepping stone to the White House\nYeah and it has happened that way through history absolutely there's no doubt about that\nAnd the young FDR didn't exactly have the common touch city I mean he didn't have um ... sort of I think of George Bush senior trying to buy Taksim Kmart back in the remember that back in Nineteen eighty eighty tried to show people he he was the common man\nAnd there was a famous TV report he's trying to buy a pair of socks at Kmart to show you know while he's just one of us and he had no idea what to do when he got up to the cash register [laughter] it's funny how that\nIt's funny how they live amongst us but they have no idea what the hell were about it's incredible really the ultra rich off during the cleaning and people who just hit and they don't have any idea about that so what we do you know and sometimes I Wonder if they really want to but it's really I mean that's a ...\nRight it's it's the time it was it's like they lived in the clouds ... happy not contracts\nDoes it right All right it's time to do is it's like they lived in the clouds Mike ... happy not\nContracted polio uh he ... he may not have been well he may have been president but it's certainly changed it to jak three of his life as you would imagine it would but also he's politics talked me about how polio affected FDR more than just physically\nWell I'll tell you what this is where I I gained a lot of a lot of respect but ah I was not necessarily you know the ... and I'm not much social it's personal\nBut you know when somebody comes down with instant pop relatives because we're all they can loses her head and they fight their way back\nUsing sure will um installing ... bars or over the bed so they can use their arms and then dragging your body will try and get themselves for a walk every day in the hospital when that happens in you know the our ways uh\nStarted to you know obviously you know well they don't treatments came in and actually work he started to identify with people who are suffering and you need it loses a gigantic flights a humble pie it actually changed your life\nRight I mean he displayed you'd have to call it of heroism or in the face of this uh this disease I mean he basically drank he's he he had on arches in France but he would drag himself from miles\nYeah every day he had this regimen that um you know he had the bars and stalled out in front of the Roosevelt mansion and he would have\nCash in these races and he would use crutches and he ... it it's just incredible depend but it it you know twelve pounds of steel on each leg and he was dragging his off if you\nDo the parallel bars where he's exercising bonds and then from the parallel bars the closest route ... in front of a A R\nAnd then he was turning around and dragging himself back ... you know quote unquote walking trying to fix stops\nWon't even if this is talk about ironclad will you know what that was was uh was really something else a ... ...\n... want to come back that\nThat part and then of course he ended up in Warm Springs Georgia where the warm waters with\nHis legs in children and other people with other selections and actually have package is likely to identify with people in\nNeed and suffering so it really changes what for sure\nAnd then there's the fast track or to the White House I'm just sort of ... we we we've got about five five minutes before we head into the break at the bottom of the hour but let's just give me instead of a sudden they'll sketch of of his\nJourney to the White House or does it start with Governor of New York or is it under secretary of the navy\nInstruct for the White House start as a liberal Wilson a turtle rental house actually who Woodrow Wilson was his idol colonel house was Woodrow Wilson's won't be able to know that at the time he was a it was it was a hostile and play on\nAnd um they were ... it's all in love with this communist ideal and um you\nKnow of course they didn't know anything about it but it was just a great thing and it was through at um ... house and I'm I'm a few hours can actually look in such from secretary of the navy and from their intended\nAnd I'm I'm a geologist and actually look in such from secretary of the navy and from there in the user Roosevelt million and that the political connections in New York to run for governor and then once governor\nI'm you know it was a it was a jump to the White House\nOne and he asked them to come out of the time when a\n... some of the things that I Want it to do\n'em\nOver want it to do but you know he was all like it kinda\nDidn't cooperate very well with with some of those were his ideas and now we don't have to jump right to a jump right to the White House and you know started the originally ran on tax cuts and everything and we realize that the old isn't working you completely flip\nAnd what you know with a socialist under the\nAnd uh you know were amazingly ... even from like the suffering so\nRight well we'll get into the the new deal in the depression and and and so forth and and the fact that it will do this after the break but I just wanted to mention the idea that someone in a in a confined to a wheelchair or and it had a such a debilitating disease polio\nOr for that person to to rise to the White House at a time when as you point out in who murdered FDR at a time when a physical handicap like this was also also equated with\nSort of ... of mind and how would that would I guess the complicity of the media that sort of agreed you know to not talk about it he never would have been president\nYou know it's amazing the parallels he made a lot it's a very sympathetic maybe it's just like today well uh [laughter] it's like today without whether it was like cooperative which I'm sure [laughter]\n... hair loss of freedom he gets a free pass\nThe or the other one's between these two guys will have to talk about when you get back but uh it's it's it's a history repeating repeating itself with the Russians\nAnd the White House and you know just all kinds of things it's incredible how often in your town and long known catches with you know they felt they are but\nHow is it that's a that no one sort of you know to store or said hey wait a minute or president does not is in a wheelchair or you can barely walk is he equipped you know this is the thinking back then you know obviously we know better now but\nThe idea that back you know Seventy eighty years ago uh that no one would take notice of that\nWell they they they pick their camera shots well and actually I Would hope people so much of the opposite of what was the guy who said\nHe would get really think on four or five thought processes at one time that you really really really do what you do is easy like with ... someone ... you will lose their arm and that helped elect crotch hurricane or something at the ... you\nWould appear to be walking picket couple of stops so they can I just you know behind the podium these are different than the shops and you know they they did it remarkably well so they they did it or to ward off the fact that are in case anything good leak out\nEat paving insurance jumping to go public and claimed that you know I'm going to shift names that so that was showing and for X amount about so I mean\nTo go public and claimed that you know I was just it was truly for X amount of hours so I mean the propaganda in those oils we're back down you know it's just that\nMaybe it was smaller and easier to control we didn't have other things so homes and listen to the phones and that's why at work\nWhen he won the the the first election or you know they'll the whole idea of the one hundred days those first one hundred days which are seen as being so important today in the media what does the president accomplish in his first hundred days that really started with FDR didn't it but ... the kind of cheated that a little bit\nYeah absolutely that I'm\n... like this is now but I'm sure at\nThis point the lemon had changed debate in which the president was going to be sworn in from march until January so you didn't go into effect until October of Nineteen thirty three which meant that rose or at a waiter take off for ...\nSo this mystery thing all the hundred days and they still just as it was a hundred days\nCardio mobile delivers a medical greedy cagey right to your

T. S. dot com [noise]\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\nWell welcome back to coast to coast am Richard Sayre coming do you live from coast to Toronto, Canada affiliate in depth radio news talked ten ten Steve you be my guest who murdered FDR\nYou know when people without these lists you know the greatest presidents and so forth FDR's often on those lists uh you know right up there with with Lincoln and Washington\nAnd Kennedy of course I'm ... FDR is is one of those presidents that you either you either loved him or hated him and uh certainly made a lot of uh of enemies rate out of the gates let's let's talk a little bit about\nUh what was happening in America when he came into the White House and of course the United states at this point is is in a mired in it you know horrible devastating depression like fifty percent unemployment and the bank system had failed and it's just sort of paint that picture for us how bad it was\nIt was pretty bad ah you know the president preceding Hoover had already accounting going and of course in in the roaring twenties well let me go you know I'm you know things were starting to\nWhere it started serving to be able to afford luxuries and the country would regret it and if it all with the knowledge and lovers and raise your taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nBe able to afford luxuries and the country but Hoover got in and fill it with the knowledge and lovers and raise your taxes and put some regulations on in here that fast\nAnd uh you know so here comes FDR and he realizes there's a lot of people who are really in trouble and suffering so he has this has low vision of legislation a in a you know in order to help these people and or so he thought\nAnd he did he did a great deal of health for a lot of people we put people to work and it was on the government or the government pay check\nAnd um this was the ... experiment from the communists the communist part of the United states of America had already set up camp in Nineteen Nineteen in this country okay so all of this information or was coming through\nOr his friends and the Communist Party of the United states of America and they're still in existence by the way and then you're on your study or and so this is was their idea of how to help the workers in the working class\nAnd it was a flood of legislation or were they he just basically regulated everything from banking to basically if you if you if you were able to take oxygen FDR regulated it at that point everything from farms to banking to securities act and all points in between\nSo this was done to put every once in a work on the government does so we could have this cradle to grave wonderful society that Stalin and the Soviets had fooled us into thinking existed\nNew ideology they thought that it was going to be this great thing where we're going to escape the ah the peaks and valleys of communism and you know the government was in charge of everything and all this new wonderful\n... valleys in capitalism I think you meant the I think he's the communist instead of equal value machine\nGun sorry about that I hear the noise of pitfalls and valleys in ... of of of capitalism you know so right\nYou meant you if I might you because you you are you you print the list of legislative\nUm um actions that were enacted\nA in in who murdered FDR and I'm just read here I'm In the emergency banking act the government economy acted beer wind revenue act\nOf creation of the civilian conservation corps abandonment of gold standard the federal emergency relief jak agricultural adjustment act emergency far mortgage act Tennessee Valley authority ac securities act aggregation of gold payment class homeowners look lone act Glass Steagall banking act national industrial Recovery Act\nEmergency railroad transportation act\nAnd the farm credit act um\nAnd he I mean he did this\nReally without much cooperation from the Congress didn't he\n[laughter] he just basically ran that through I wasn't gonna work everybody with that Richard I'm Glad you did that I Will not\nDo that I'm happy to bore them with it you know [laughter] so\nI mean it's just a laundry list but it's just it gives you a sense because you mentioned you know that this was right out of almost like the communist manifesto that and he had the kind of control that Stalin had in the Soviet Union which is kind of an interesting parallel\n... it's very true it granted it was the Walt Disney version of it but it was it ... it certainly was\nThe same basic control he was carrying\nJust like Stalin style and just Persia all of his enemies you know if you got in a way of style and you know you ended up that his first two wives his doctor who told things to\nUm you know he he just went crazy um the great purge was basically a show trials to put anybody to death that either disagree with him or good challenge and politically\nAnd that kind of Stalin did it FDR did it by what packing the Supreme Court\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worry you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit\nRight what happened is my Nineteen thirty six he had worried you know there was an election coming so you know he thought that people were getting a little bit you know a weary of the new deal so he came out with a second new deal it also wasn't working to the extent that he thought\nOkay so well all of this was going on in Europe is great wars ... you know he's seen lots of Europe's war was going to do our thing we're in trouble we're staying out of it so if this was a great a second new deal must be better so\nUm and they start to put a you know implement and then the second new deal and they start to realize that substantial portions of it were unconstitutional so the um he had to pack the Supreme Court to see if you get it passed and that was I mean he was really really fiddling with things I mean\nA tremendous amount and I know in the history books\nHistory books say a lot of things are I Know the history books page and there's this wonderful magical genie of or economics or says he wasn't there was an economic failure\nPeople were ah they were surviving and that was about it that was about all they were doing and you know unless we got into that war and started to move some goods and services where were you know we're we're we're still going to be in the new deal for until his death I mean it was it was a it was a cat a ... it was the topic is atrophy\nHow do you use the trading with the enemy act or to to to gain more power lend lease dismissed planes you know the the trading trading with the enemy act\nWell [laughter] again when he did was that was just an attempt to bolster the economy and the Senate was the same thing with the with the one lease program he was moving you know munitions in goods and services to the to the to defeat the access powers\nAnd he was giving him to the to our allies you know free France included and eventually this the Soviet Union\nSo that we could win and they were just running up a cash register to be paid back at a later time so there's a you know there's there's a lot going on here I mean he started to ... he had to do that because it started to realize the new deal was not working\nSo there was no there was a lot going on economically in in our country and then there came to a point where\nHe knew that we had to get into this war and the spies indeed and you know we have spies who I Know I Know it sounds terrible we do all countries have it I'm more you have spies too are spies in Germany were starting to tell us they're finishing your have your water experiments\nAnd with the beats who rockets to get rid of the nuclear weapons to all for it to the globe\nWe'd be speaking German right now\nI mean they were on the brain so we had to get into this war for economic reasons and for other reasons it was a great catalyst hear what's going on fascinating time in history scary time in history\nSo in the book you argue as many as I have that that FDR new Japanese attack on the U.S was coming the only question was when um then the question is did he get he sort of make it happen Beatty let it happen or what he just sort of glad it happened", "show_name": "Coast to Coast AM with George Noory", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "21"}
