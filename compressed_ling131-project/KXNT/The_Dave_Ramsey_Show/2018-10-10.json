two to five Jordan is in Indianapolis Hi Jordan welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up\nSo as of last week I've completed my debt free journey by over forty years paying out over eighty four thousand a hundred and Seventy five dollars\nAnd uh well I'm trying to figure out now in terms of buying a house what is the best way to kind of shave and going out because I've been thinking about just talking the money but also investing to maybe get a better rate of return by doing that way what what are your thoughts on that\nRight job right now I'm trying to make sure you're going to save\nWell as of right now my monthly expenses are only about eleven hundred so out of my salary tried to say about twenty two twenty three hundred and if I really buckle down about twenty six hundred\nA month correct for how long will depend on the type of house of looking at twenty percent on a down payment on a hundred and fifty call you about at least\nTen months bare minimum that play around fifty percent but I did a year should be able to get that it can include bonuses impacts your turn them such\nOkay well twelve months will be thirty thousand bucks and if you invested started thousand dollars which you don't have today but if you were to invest thirty thousand dollars and it made ten percent in one year you would make three thousand dollars\nCorrect okay\nI'm now we don't have ... thirty thousand dollars so it's like over the course of that year you'd have more like an average of Fifteen thousand dollars invested and so if you make ten percent you'd make about Fifteen hundred dollars\nMhm okay and so if you have thirty thousand dollars at the end of one year to put down on the house\nOr you have thirty one thousand five hundred dollars to put down\nOn a house doesn't matter much volunteer at\nThe point as the as huge saving money on the short term as aggressively as you have the ability to save money um is the secret sauce not the investment\n\nOkay during this year Jordan is worth thirty grand mutual fund Fifteen hundred Jordan is the answer to our equation\nOkay that makes sense yes or no\n\nLas Vegas ... use talking forty AM accent the\nBoom boom boom boom [noise] Mm\nThank you for joining us Solomon is with us in Atlanta Hi Solomon ...\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve ...\nWell they have a long story short ah I'm I'm a doctor graduated from medical school just finished reading in the and I have about three hundred and eighty thousand in a student loans mainly all from a\nMedical school Lon most planning out is planning to do or the public service loan forgiveness program no\nTo pay it off our um that didn't kind of fall through my current only me I'm just trying to figure out the will do a good way to to pay that off into so comfortably and death actually come to create a financial burden\nOkay just for a future reference thirty thousand people of now applied for the a loan for the federal loan service forgiveness ... service forgiveness\nNinety six have been granted it out of thirty to out of thirty thousand it's a complete scam it's not happening the\nGovernment of screwed you're so good I'm Glad you're not signed up for that so what is your income please God told me it's large\nIt all my combining I'm married so with my wife uh about three hundred and thirty\nGood [noise]\nOkay so you're gonna you're you don't get to live like a doctor because you're a broke Dr yeah you're going to live like a college student okay hope you had to start buying crap\nCan't answer that have you started buying crap bought bought one thing is one what the court what'd you buy\nA car a God yeah yeah yeah now do\nYou know what did you pay for\nAbout fifty thousand\nOkay you're a three hundred and eighty thousand dollars in debt you can never do that again I don't plan to you can never do anything like that again you're not going on vacation\nI Am not a band aid off slowly guy that crap does not work and so what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes as I Would live on fifty thousand dollars a year or less which would make me debt free in under three years\nOkay and then I Would start my life the great news is you have the ability to delay pleasure for greater outcome we know that because you've gone to school your whole freaking life ... and you're very smart academically\nOr you wouldn't be where you are okay and you have the ability to delay pleasure which is a sign of emotional maturity and you have a great intellect let you use those two things and apply them to this mess that you are in called deeply in debt now you can do it the other way but I'll tell you this\nYour colleagues\nAre walking around out there with three hundred four hundred two hundred thousand dollars worth of medical school that for a decade because they play with it and they never kill the disease\nThe only way you kill it is extreme treatment\nRadical and it's the only way it goes away it's going to stay with you forever otherwise\nSo that's what I Would do if I woke up in your shoes I Would treat it like I Am I broke doctor because I'm a broke doctor and broke doctors don't by fifty thousand dollar cars are going to develop vacations\nSo you're not doing that crap anymore you get on a tight budget beans and rice rice and beans and clean up this mess because if you take the three year old older than you are now you and go forward with a three or four hundred thousand dollar income and no debt urine it'd be so wealthy it's going to be blinding\nIf you watch what you're doing\nBut if you just screw around with this thing and keep it like it's a pet it's going to be a problem for you Laurie is with us in Boise idaho Hi Laurie how are you\nDave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm at this point where I could be giving 'em you can't fight now ladder and my mom has been in a nursing home for ten years mhm\nAnd I moved here at the LBJ style of and if she is in a very very small ram and have a large one and I was wondering whether that be considered giving\nTo help get her ... her semi private ran and help pay for her cost of living\nTrue must have been giving 'em would it be typing no but it would be giving yes um I don't ... I mean I don't know what you mean by giving but um you have the money to do this or you broke or what\nNo I have the money to gas okay and you're you're out of debt yeah okay\nAnd you have or how much money in your nest egg\nThree hundred of them and how old are you having good very good okay what's your into about Ninety thousand cool you're single single and what are you talking about spending\nIt will cost me about a thousand dollars a month\nOkay the twelve ran out of Ninety and you can keep saving doing that 'cause you don't have any that you can keep investing so you retire with dignity and you can take care of\nYourself when you're in the exact same situation later right that's\nWhat I Want to eat the only gave you where you don't put yourself exposed to the elements so to speak by helping someone else but I think it's wonderful you have the money you've done a great job you're out of debt and you're in a position you want to give twelve thousand dollars a year towards your mom's sure\nNo problem with that OK absolutely what do they want to be the right thing\nThey like you said about giving the tribe that funding to make sure I was going to write and found\nI think you are just wonderful gift and uh your your time to her and you know what a wonderful\nYou know act of love torture mama and and and again you put yourself in the position you have the money to do that without bringing harm\nTo yourself and that's that's what we're talking about live like no one else so later you can live and the gills why one else was very very cool Tony is with us Tony is in a Washington Hi Tony how are you\nI'm well how can I help\nI was curious why you advocate a money market accounts are low you become or like are murky coupon\nBecause your emergency fund is not an investment it's insurance\nOkay it's there the principal has to be there and accessible and liquid because if you're a transmission goes out or you lose your job you get your hands on it\nThe right of return is irrelevant it's insurance the ... of the things that does make you money to see what happens is people don't have an emergency fund act accessible and they got to set up in something where they get penalized if it comes out is not liquid and then they they have an emergency you know what they do\nThe bar owner four one K. long\nLike a four one K. long they borrow guess for for a winter they catch it out worse yet\nAnd they create a mess because they got to do that to save their house 'cause they didn't have money that was liquid they got stuck those are all worried about trying to make an extra point or two on the money instead of hurt creating it gets insurance insurance is ... is an expense\nMoney tied up at one percent you would agree is an expense 'cause it sucks it's a horrible right of return it could be invested in making more\nBut that portion that five or ten or twenty thousand dollars or whatever it is is just sitting there just as a barrier\nBetween you and the life\nAnd that's all it's for it's not an investment it's insurance investments make money insurance costs you money to protect the things that make you money and dishes insurance so good question though that that's the whole reasoning behind that\nThanks for calling him open follows a triple eight eight to five five two to five yeah when you find you know why because it's gone on\nIn your bed or having an umbrella coming into gotta get ready for this is the day Ramsey show [laughter]\n\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot
