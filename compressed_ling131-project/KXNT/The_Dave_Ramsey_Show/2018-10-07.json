Malone does that come through so by back out of the deal\nYou cancel the escrow is there any language and the escrow about uh the deposit me know hardware so non refundable deposit\nThere are some language that kind of a standard California perched agreement where\nOne of the loan contingency is way which I wait for the first month than the so the title who has grown apart\nLocate so it was All right see shot so since you agreed to wait long did not come through right all of the terms of that agreement that you signed up I have been mad and I said you don't get your five thousand dollars back or what am I missing Steve here what what questions do you have\nWell we're talking with another real estate agent who's a neighbor\nAnd when you talk about that there are tons of projects he's been in tons and he's watch houses I bought houses where it says die if\nAll the conditions the mad and you bailout you lose your deposit so I I I don't know how many deals your ah your your neighbor escrow your neighbor real estate agents been in and I know yeah that that money is wash for sure\nHey Daniel you're up we're going to do for you\nKnow they're all um I run to reach out to me and asked if he could use my credit card or a hotel room it was over before I eat my credit card number I contact with my writing heart out there that had like a rise in power for anywhere or how did you thousand dollars that\nWe can do a maximum of five hundred dollar\nAnd at that date I read provide my credit card number a new days later I when I log on my online credit card account and noticed that there was a pending charge or forty five hundred dollar\nI immediately contacted the credit card company and said hey look you know I only authorized employee five hundred dollars and I'm seeing opinions hardened gr forty five hundred that day to day stand\nLook you know that that was on the Indian light of day however wanted actually registered there won't be leveling the twenty five hundred dollar ... when the Harvard actually posted it was for over five thousand dollars\nJumps gladly you days later I logged back into my online account and there was another opinion tower for the same hotel for over seven thousand dollar reached out all the credit card company again and said hey look there are they any hard hit rovers having thousand dollars\nIt is is this is Roger ... a being use right now I only authorized them five hundred dollar thought which there's already a won't do them out for over five thousand um and they said to me that that you know there's nothing we can do with it and in charge and then with the dealer vendor has already charged her heart was taking part in it many times they want\nAnd and the end of the day there was over twelve\nThousand dollar home and your friends spent twelve thousand dollars of one hotel Iraq well there was a friend there was a friend of yours brilliant\nExactly so my question to you is that when I reach out to the credit card company or get providing right around the credit card number and they gave me the or the bear that no more than twenty five hundred dollars a charged up and then\nYou know quietly they're building ... bell writer drive drive and you have a record\nYeah you do and here's the problem you're going to have though and that is a they're simply going to deny it oh we didn't see that or a policy has led us to do that and I wish you and send an email\nOr to the credit card company but I don't know how many people would actually do that because you know your friend you didn't know your friend was see I used to come for their word and\nSo I I'm not I'm not going to call you idiot on this one because I think a lot of people would have done the same thing I I probably would have done the same thing so you're entirely you retire issue is\nUh that uh the credit card company I told you that you're reliable it's twenty five hundred dollars that's all they're gonna charge and then you started arguing the dispute everything right down the line now on there I'm Sorry go ahead\nOh you're going to have taken those dams and I just you know the charges and through their quote unquote investigation they come back and said you know what we're going to stand by those hard and you are held liable\nWhen did they what did they say about the twenty five hundred dollar limit conversation\nUh when I when I discussed that with them to hang around with representative I spoke with several conversations with different wraps and tried to climate change within the hardcover they some of them said oh you know I it's unfortunate that this representative made a mistake when she authorized only after twenty five hundred dollars\nIt's her mistake\n... term mistake and it doesn't matter that she works for us a term mistake come on give me a break on that one now or is there any record in your file that says twenty five hundred dollars a limit to have you talked to anybody to look at the notes\nThat they are going to look at it you know you look obviously all your all your phone conversation go recorded right on the ocean purposes and I got through to one of the earth and she acknowledged that there were several Congress Asian she went back and let them\nAnd I can tell the outer ear on the phone call as you can understand wrote rum ... aging only come from the company\nI'm hearing on the recording this and so I received a letter from if I could have an obvious doesn't oriented obviously they have no right but I received\nA letter in the mail said there were conversations only or different days and so we documented on their lead\nWriter so you've got so we're going to happen is going to turn it over the collections you're going to disputed a collections are going to ... your credit and at that point unfortunately I'm you're going to win that you just tell them ... to me just go ahead and to me uh and we'll talk about this I Will later on what you have to worry about is your um is your credit\nYeah and that this was about an hour ago where I was in the payment on the credit card\nWait a minute have you gone over the twenty five hundred dollars\nI have not not that far reaching out right\nRight and then here's here's the only advice you go up as far as you can in the food chain\nI and or if you've done that and just keep on going over and over again find out who the vice president is in terms of stupid employees a that put a lot more on a credit cards and they should there ... there are certainly a vice president does that somewhere in the system and at the same time I had the collection well once you\nA ... I Would cancel the card and children and just get right into it and say hey because what's happening is you're paying interest on the entire amount and you're going no place and that's just stupid\nTo pay interest on twelve thousand dollars when I was twenty five hundred dollars so I you just I Would stop paying let them know you're stopping a payment based on this you're disputing I'm assuming you're turning over the collections I'll be fighting that\nAnd there will be legal action taken if you've seen my credit and uh if you try to collect that simple and then I Would call and you may even want to go to a lawyer a collection lawyer a dead a quick call was a yeah just collections layer and die and buying an hour of time or just ask\nA is am I doing everything right and we are I mean I don't know ... anywhere\nAnywhere else to go I mean finding credit card companies credit reporting agencies and it is such a drag\nThis is handle on the law\n[noise]\nCyber criminals could attack your
