[noise]\n\nGive us some of those are the rams are show actually is in Los Angeles I actually well from what I've read your show [noise]\nFridays thanks for taking my call sure what's up in your work\nSo um my husband and I don't agree he recently came back from a deployment and said he wants a divorced in a bankruptcy so\nUm we are fifty thousand dollars in debt and last year remain thirty five thousand are that breaks down to twenty five and car penance to known and Fifteen and credit card ... I'm just not sure where to go [laughter]\nOkay and um so uh what do you make\n[laughter] now I Am not working I recently moved back ah with family\nSo you're separated [laughter] okay and family is in Los Angeles yeah okay and um do you have children now\nSo I'm I'm guessing based on that separation that the divorce rate is going ahead or not\nYes it will be okay right\nWell whether you agree on filing for bankruptcy or not is irrelevant um he decides what he's going to do when you decide what you're going to\nDo if you're not married and even if you are married technically because you don't file bankruptcy as a married couple\nUm in other words when I filed I could have filed insurance not filed except that she had sons from the paper's searchers you got to file too but um and we had to file on all the different corporations mellow sees that we had at the time that was Thirty years ago\nUm show or in this case he could file and you not file\nThat's possible whose whose name is the student loan\nOkay so that doesn't affect him anymore that's your student loan either way whose name of the credit cards in both Iraq evenly are all our you're both on all of them were both on all of them okay\nWere he to file and you not to file you would be left last man standing and get to pay them\nOkay okay that's how that would work whose name is the car in Baltimore who's got the car\nOr they're two different cars and we're both on him and he has one and I gather\nOh it's so twenty five is cars and waste the breakdown of the twenty five break it out for me\nUh Fifteen and can\nYou know ... OK\nOkay the rule on a an asset that has\nUm\nThat that has a lien against it is this you cannot get rid of the debt and keep the asset\nOkay so you could you could or he could file bankruptcy and you can clear off the credit card debt student loan debt is not bankrupt double it's not going away you've got your student loan back that's done okay the corners then you cannot keep the car unless you keep the debt\nYou can reaffirm the debt\nOkay you've found on me but that's the only way you keep the car and so sometimes people don't understand bankruptcy and they think oh I can just get rid of the debt and that and like sort of the debt off and they give me the car free and clear no that's not how it works is why they would lean on the car\nOkay so they either get the car and wipe off whatever difference there is or was a I'm\nA ... or in the event of a bankruptcy you resign for the whole debt and you keep the guard show which of the cars is yours the Fifteen of the ten\nOr Fifteen okay and what does that car worse do you have an idea I'd say about ten okay All right\nAnd so you've got the ten thousand dollars in student loan debt you're going to get that either way no matter what happens here the Fifteen thousand dollars in credit card debt you understand if he files and you don't you've got that\nAnd then you got the other car now in the event of a divorced what I Would demand is that if he's going to keep a car that he refinancing and get your name off of it\nOr if he's filing bankruptcy um I guess he turns it in in the bankruptcy or gives it to you to sell or whatever the car the he's driving is it worth at least what's vote on it\nAnd say about that okay so you could just sell that car and break even but I'm a you know if you can work that out in this deal so this is a mess is what it is and you already knew that okay yeah so the scenarios are\nThat um you know what will you be making what kind of an income do you think you'll land into\nUm I'm a veterinarian and so I Would say about Thirteen an hour and working fulltime\nAre you a D. V. him no oh no I'm attack your attack okay\nAll right and so I'm In that's in the Los Angeles area or you're going to be somewhere else okay All right so you're going to land on that and then you're going to clean up your student loan debt and the credit card debt and the card that if he walks on all of it\nYeah okay now if he chooses not to file and fight through it than the two of you got to work through this together and you're going to be what does he make\n[laughter] ah last year he made 'em out\nBe what does he make\n[noise] ah last year he made about a twenty five\nOkay be coming out of the military\nNow his tail and have share in the military [laughter]\nYeah no I have no security clearance you understand that he understands and I'm sure yeah you file bankruptcy or security clearance has gone\nSo I mean his chances of moving up in the military are are are harmed pretty dramatically if he falls or mine corruption but he didn't make any money should man and he just came home of a deployment and he's lost his mind it sounds like oh my goodness\nYeah [laughter] Mm I'm so sorry I didn't care\nYou know just trying to start over and it's not going to be as easy for him as he wants it to behold as a\nChronic haven't yeah okay\nWell um I I think you sit down with your pastor and if you need to talk to a bankruptcy attorney to understand the things I'm Talking about that's fine um\nI think if he files and you don't you've got to force him\nA to sell the car that is in his name and probably we're going to sell yours too okay I'm In and get through it you know get you a five thousand dollar loans the difference and then you work your way out of the credit card debt the little bit of a car loan driving a beat her and the student loan debt is going to take you a little while with your income\nBut you can do that it doesn't mean you have to file just because he files mathematically or legally\nOkay this is just making sense to you yeah [laughter] so I'm Sorry your face and all this what a mouse listen if you get in the middle of and you're going to that question you call me back I'll help you okay\nThank you thank you Chris is with us in Minneapolis Hi Chris how are you\nGood Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWith a question about life insurance or I'm not very uh ... uh I spoke with your guys Vander and uh [noise]\nYou know they had them kinda borderline whether or not to get a term life insurance [laughter] I've got a wife to kids at home and I'm the premium it'd be pretty expensive uh [noise]\nIf I Do get approved so I guess my question is two parts do I still go for it even if it's you know three four hundred dollar a month premium um\nThree or four hundred a month for how much coverage\nFor um ten times my my pay a million\nDollars for a million dollars okay ... what is your medical problem\nAh basically ... to\n... you know how to get you okay are you are you overweight\nYeah okay I'd have to give me too [laughter] yeah okay\nYeah that they can help you more with the diabetes if you get the white down which also by the way up to the doctor already told you that you knew that right\nOh yeah I'm working on a good good for you so hard struggle um\nSo what I might do is make sure my family's lot left with nothing and my smaller policy\nUntil we can do those two things and let let's get the weight off and get the diabetes more under control at that point and see if we can get a better rate two years from now or something\nHere and um you start to see the ... the actual economic value of taking care of yourself in those situations in addition to just oh I get to live longer hello you know so [laughter] you already knew these things right right um yeah\nUh but but I mean what if you took half that and at least you know she's are or how much you owe on your home [noise]\nUh two eighty [laughter] what does she does she work outside the home now she works out she was ...\nKnow so if you had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and\nTwo eighty what does she does she work outside the home now she worked for her she went to know\nNow so if you had like five hundred and that would pay off the house and put a couple of hundred in the pocket if something happened to you that's better than a half million it's not the proper amount but at least you got for that [noise]\n\nYou're struggling with money relationships career you name it you're stuck and you don't know what to do\nI mean you know I ... and I've talked to him and people will talk to him people dumped on him we love him all that but I Can't make him want to stop drinking he has to decide that right\nAnd again it's really painful to watch people you love do stupid stuff that kills themselves you know I mean money wise or anything else so the only thing that I've had any success doing\nIs to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's any one that they look up to almost\nSuccess doing is to possible approaches one is ask yourself if there's any one that they look up to\nOn the subject of business or money it does he have a brother that he thinks is brilliant or do they have a friend or a pastor that they think is they trust their judgment and then try to get that person who does have credibility with them to speak into their life\nThat's a possibility the other possibility that probably will be more likely is for you not to say a word about their habits or their financial situation but every time you're around them tell your story\nMhm mom we were so scared mom we were freaked out mom we were fighting about money all the time we were so overwhelmed I couldn't breathe\nManchester is getting tight and you know what we did was we got on this budget and we cut up our credit cards and we're not there yet and put man I feel so much better and I'm On my way and no one can argue with you about your story and your feelings\nRight but don't Wagner finger at her and say no you need to do this to instead of just just keep talking about what's happened in your life what's what happened with you ... what's your deal and eventually they're going to say something like well I Wish I could do that\nWill you know it'd be nice it'd be nice to get control and they got it or that Debbie Downer\nRight or party thing right the martyr thing I Know and people do that all the time and as soon as I Do that that's your opening jump in and go I think you can I really think 'cause I felt the same way I didn't think I could do it but I think you really can I think you can get\nWhen they found that if they do ... you\nKnow no no no you're you're you're already you're already jumped to the front lawn you got slammed down this you start saying that and that conversation is she gonna shut you down ghetto yeah all you got to do just talk about what if you did for you are or not for her just get\nAbout enabling like with your alcoholics and obviously you wouldn't know allow for and drink\nAnd John Barr knowing what I Would like giving money to drink\nYour rights and my parents they're basically eating out to death ... times a day\nFor all that is and and my dad gets read tired and they only have one income that are living on to it and kind of you know\nAnd and so when we met that they don't live in our in our state and so we go visit them and my dad he wants to take us out to the fancy dinner just show that he loved that we live here it's so much but I just want to scream absolutely\nNot not for kids and I don't want to drain our relationship well it\nSaid that you know what we're learning in our story as we're learning that we can't do that and so it makes us very uncomfortable to do that with you so let's find another way to celebrate our time at home because we don't want to go out to eat it won't be fun for us\nBut don't go and you only take us out to eat or to broke that stupid\nIf you know what you're laying on that day that that's what you're thinking\nAnd I'm thinking yeah right I agree with you but if you say that kind of stuff so you got to direct it all back to you back to you back to you\nBack to you talk about how you feel about this not about how you feel about them or their behaviors\nBut you're just back and talk about you used to feel the way and you turn it loose you used to feel and now I feel good I used to be freaked out now I'm not in you know of course it only to be the truth by the way and you know tell the truth and\nYou know but I used to I I felt that way too personally I mean I went broke Shannon I went broke we killed each other

is up versus our Darryl is one of those Hi Darryl welcome to that Iran's Asia [noise]\nPrime minister and real pleasure to talk to you you too sir what's up man I gotta\nA pleasure to talk to you you too sir what's up man\nHey I got a little bit of a different question I haven't really heard you talk about it on the on the air before but I'm just a little bit of background my wife and I were in baby steps to we have been working the snowball since last October and we're\nTwelve thousand dollars away from chicken Sallie Mae outta the house and we'll be done are so proud of our debt free screen next hopefully next spring so\nWe're on our way um but uh we are a coordinating our third financial piece class ... and one of the things that keeps coming up that we're trying to figure out and also help advise others as you know were single income family my wife stays at home or health insurance costs is outrageous sure\nAnd and last month I had known as anybody else I'm a wake laugh my way to go through and they're all ... up again and so we're we're spending like twelve hundred dollars a month to carry the family on work insurance and and you know it's OK I'm trying to buy an everybody in the area is kind of the all the fat or coal could choose from just\nEverything's expensive here and so I'm ... I'm going to\nOh I Know it's an ... in one one of the things I just I just want to\nI kind of want to buck the system and throw away and\nI'm One of the things we've been looking into is these are Christian health share ministries and I think for a while you guys might have been even been endorsing one for a while I Can't remember but we do anyways we're we've got some other families in our class fair you know single income just paying thousand dollars a month for ... for the ...\nYear for health insurance but yeah and you know we can do a family on the health care mystery shopping for your mind about ... I just\nI wanted to get your take and see if it you know something physically in baby steps to you know where\nMy wife and I talked about it were a little more comfortable you know when we have a fully funded emergency fired by now I don't know we're just trying to navigate that and I want to get your take\nOn the uh we do indoors a Christian healthcare ministries is one of our ah sponsors for the live events and for some other things over the years I'm full disclosure I have a group health care plan at our company here this Blue Cross Blue Shield that is my personal healthcare\nSo on and I'm real careful on the show is you know or even through financial ... not to recommend to people to do something I don't do\nThat kind of a thing but I'm In a little different situation I've got a decent program a available to me um and so a Christian healthcare ministries um the the you know the bottom line was the thing is it's technically not insurance says you know\nIt is like all sharing and it is based on the book of acts we're Christians band together and share each other's burdens or innocence becomes cooperatives down his what it's doing 'em and uh the the\nYou know I Would never suggest going into something like that that did not have a long or even the possibility of going into something like that that did not have a long track record\nAnd these guys have thirty forty years of having never missed a single claim now you have to read and you should read very carefully to what it covers and what it does not cover\nAnd know that and they've got a couple of plans you can buy the upgrade plan that covers different things and that kind of a thing\nFamily plan their singles plan and all that they've got a normal you know an array of products so to speak to learn what's covered and what is not covered learn how it works um because it is technically not insurance you're technically if someone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim so it's worked\nSomeone else in the program chose not to share\nThen war would you be you know technically but they've never failed to make a claim\nSo it's worked for forty years you know I mean or whatever number of years but decades right so uncomfortable with its credibility in that regard it is different than insurance and we get our brains get dolled into how health insurance works and this has got some nuances some differences to it so learn what those are\nNumber one number to know that I don't personally do it even though I Do believe in it\nNumber three the only way I Do it as if they had a long long long track record which these guys do and it is a Christian\nHealthcare ministries and so a ... and the ... that their definition of that is is that if you use tobacco or ... or alcohol then you don't qualify\nAnd so they're already hard core in that regard um and so you need to you know be aware that that's there and that's a limiting factor as well and they you know they want you to affirm your face as part of the process you're Christian faith\nAs a part of the process and so that's who it's for and how it's laid out but all of that and once you know all those nuances and you know those differences and you can see them um we would not have endorsed that if we didn't think it had credibility\nRight and that way and and I guess if I could ask one follow up question we were to go through that even in baby steps you and all that kind of one of the things that my wife with a little concerned about\nOne of the ones we're looking into that has the long term track record and and we're OK with all the requirements where yeah where where evangelical Christians all that kind of felt they were ever normally pretty healthy and it seems like a good fit for our family\nBut like one of 'em you know you pay out of pocket kind of like when I say for Fifteen hundred bucks and stuff so if you're a baby that you would you recommend it when they go that route\nTo set aside that they're coming out of dollars to insulate you against those\nAre now you've got an already you've already got a thousand and baby step on so you're close enough\nAnd if you run up over just budget your other five hundred into your budget flow or you might have to slow down your debt snowball a little bit in baby steps to cover some bills if you had an event right round or it's just like carrying largest adoptable as you said in a nature or something I'm but I'm going to take\nThat part of the risk gone for sure and I'm so forth but but you know Christian healthcare ministries is the one that we endorse hey man thanks for the call April's weather's April's in New York City Hi April how are you\nHave to say Hi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nSo I didn't know whether or not and my husband and I should move 'em in order to get out of that [noise] um we don't like our house okay um\nSo we're out

make different choices you can live on a budget you can take out an extra job for a short period of time\nAnd pay off that that is but the sad thing is that they had read like that they've just also they don't think you know you're right I Hope I Hope that someone is now I think someone doesn't say I would rather\nNot I'd rather not give up cable and go to jail because in jail didn't have cable in jail [noise]\nNo I don't think I mean I think is limited and it's like murder she wrote from Thirty years ago so here's the foreign Dave Ramsey has a plan so we're having fun with this crazy stuff but the reality is if you're joining show today and you feel that loss of hope you feel that desperate\nThat your basic freedoms you would give up your basic ...\nWe've got a plan is called Dave baby steps total money make over walk you through it joined the show the conversation on a daily basis take inspiration from the men and women that are showcase every day on the show do that every screen\nWell and on this show and and the right to cruise shall we always have a couple of come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ... you're listening to what you it's it's\nWell and on this show and and the right to cruise shall we always have couples come in and share their story and when I left in it and it's ... all of you listening to what you\nIt's it's everyday average Americans that's where it is people don't make crazy and kind of they don't have like a super being Cape like no these are everyday people choosing something different in this room and that's that you have to choose something different for a different outcome and so that's that's the power in it but again anyone out there you can do is\nJoins doable AAA eight to five five two to five is the phone number that is how it started to take the step today triple eight eight to five five two to five let's go to Eric who's on the line and Kansas City Eric how can we help\n[noise] hey how's it going good how are you sir\nGood um so I have two options I'm a registered nurse and I'm looking I going to grad school either a nurse practitioner scores see aren't a school [noise] we owe a hundred K. on her house or get free otherwise um we have a four month old and we're looking at having a second baby in the next year\nI'm In the school like a cash flow and worked full time through sharing a goal would be a little bit longer it's about a five year program and totality of what just prerequisites and and I could not work through the three years and the dead of that would be Ninety thousand dollars at the end of it\nAnd so I mean the payouts are different obviously in ... make a hundred K. give or take a ... make sure the one Seventy five\nWhich do you really want if all those money things weren't an issue and you had the responsibility of a wife and the children in the house and all that which one would you want if you could snap your fingers\n[noise] [laughter] it's hard for me to personally answer just because there is a vantage isn't disadvantages to um I don't think that would take away your name over right okay but I mean I Would be happy as empty as well\nOkay so the question becomes a can you take that next step or what are you calling in tea there right\nYeah nurse practitioner\nOkay ill okay in ... and so if you do that can you over time work your way into the other role\nNot without going back to that through your program enjoy fame prerequisite\nFlight but my point is let's say you're in ... for five to seven years you've got a no debt you may even pay your house often that time and so you cash flow your way through that as you move up the ladder how old are\nYou twenty nine yeah I just wonder can you do it just logistically can you do if you go into the into the situation you're going to casual that so no additional debt can you overtime save enough money to casual your way through that ultimate role\n\nOn really know what are you making now sixty\nOkay so you'd have a forty grand bump basically ... a year with that and how much is at school costs again you said that you the cash flow\nOr that one would be forty K total and the other one is nine thousand yeah\nCorrect oh you could do it just started ... salary honestly\nAnd go and do that is forty can invest that but you're going to make forty came back and a year the Atkins right if you do that I Know front pointed that many years have apps that and then go back to school yeah you may not be able to do than the other school right now like you said 'cause you don't have the cash for it so no don't go into student loan debt for that\nBut go ahead and go through the school get an upgraded job upgrade basically and you enjoy other one and a sense that's where an increase in income at least\nAnd yeah and then move into the school and a few years and cash flow at\nYou know that ... I just want you to have that idea in your head I think well you pause you sitting there trying to run the numbers and I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there is a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what\nAnd I think what I'm trying to do is make sure that you see that there's a ladder to that ultimate goal might it take you seven or eight years yes but guess what eight years now you're thirty seven you can cash flow your way so I think it's both fans that's what I said\nBecause both of them are what you want to do both of them or something if you're good at art folks more of your calls about your life your career your money here on the day ran to show don't go anywhere [noise]\n\nAre you on of the millions of empty nesters are look around their house and just see unused space it might be time to downsize but when you raised a family and I have a lot of emotion is tied to your home it can be tough to separate the facts\nPeople in the family that need this specific ... that they can give you the referral a cause that would be huge as well so that that takes a little bit of time to kind of build up your book a business you had that financial coached by it totally doable and to make that money for sure and so I definitely would go through our training on that route\nAnd I think you bring up a good point racial Chris at twenty eight I think you do need to look at the differences even if they're somewhat nuanced somewhat specific between the coach\nAnd the plant or because I think you can be a financial planner and make that money a lot faster and it's still a coach me Dave says all the time\nWe go sit down with Jeff do bonds and his team that's that's our one of our local guys if I sit down with Jeff and I we want to know that he's got the heart of a teacher well that's ... so I Do think you've got to do some specific research there Chris to be able to determine what does it look like day to day what do I want to be doing day to day that fulfills me\nAnd at twenty eight you have plenty of time to get there but in the meantime while you're pursuing the plan I Can't say this enough you're not being dishonest\nYou're not being a shy stir in the current job so let go of some of that guilt um and and I think you're going to be fine I just would not let that way on you\nTriple eight to five five two to five is the number two in Komen Rachel crew sitting in for Dave Ramsey this hour let's go to Kimberly who's on the line in Nottingham, Pennsylvania Kimberley how can we do\n[noise] I can on my end to the five years old I had been teaching in public school and the health care for 'em Thirty years\nOn and I just found in the last few years that on ... it's time for me to look for something else about the last year really then I'm drawn to real estate I looked into it\nYeah I can collect my retirement um if I retire with it for a little bit of a penalty on as opposed to going up all thirty five years my only on\nA challenge or block is some convincing my hunger thing that's a good idea because it would be a bit of a difference and the other there's about twenty five thousand dollars in salary but I Know that I can make that um I I really get excited thinking it out\nOn helping people find homes and thirty and I find that really interesting okay not what I Love my teaching but it's just time for it\nI get it I got good news I got good news for you and your husband okay [laughter] so for you to become a realtor a successful realtor it's going to take you a little bit of time\nAnd I think the fact that you just reveal to us and our audience that you're still enjoy teaching there is no big hurry you're not calling in a completely burned out and so I Would not take the penalty either I how many more years just for fun real quick how many more years would you have to stay in the role\nOf teacher before he retired without penalty\nFor five years\nI just want to throw scenario what is over the next five years you built your real estate business showing homes at night and on the weekends\nI think that's extremely doable anybody that's ever been successful in real real estate knows you're going to build a pipeline your husband's only real concern sounds like to me Rachel is that he doesn't want you to lose that twenty five thousand dollars that's a that's a scary thing certainly your age\nWhat if you kept the teacher salary for maybe three years still take a little bit of penalty but I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business\nOver five year period is going to be here before you know it you step into\nBut I'd like to see you go all the way build that real estate business over five year period is going to be here before you know it you\nStep into retirement full benefits and by that time you should have easily replaced if not maybe another extra you know twenty five thirty percent above and beyond what you make you I think you can just absolutely double your income while still being a teacher I think that's the thing that I Want you to consider Rachel\nWhile going to say it's a great situation to be an because real estate usually agents show how this when people aren't working so that means it is nice in it as we get that's what the busiest time and so to say hey I'm going to commit for maybe when you and your husband can decide that a year or two years three years or ... even go to five years if you can\nWhatever it is that it were and commit the amount of time and if you start to see yourself like well I'm really good at it because you sound very enthusiastic about it you sound like a people person which means you're gonna be a great residents in Asia because most people do great when they have great people skills as it sounds like you to get really so\nEven though you're enthusiastic you still may not be great at it you can kind of get some things on your belt while you're learning for again a year or two\nMaybe three years whatever your husband decide\nAh and it kind of step into it yeah I wouldn't go cold turkey by any means but I think that this could be excellent because having a great real estate agent here and I think about it is it still commission base that you get to decide what you make basically like how much you work how many how you sell super fun versus going from where we're at a salary as a teacher\nTo do something like that can be very incredible for you personally and you may find that you're really good at it and maybe in a year inside the\nUs and I think once you show the hubby replaces the toys R Us right for all I Want to be the ones usually watch go and follows wind besieged just on the show he trained the tough little
