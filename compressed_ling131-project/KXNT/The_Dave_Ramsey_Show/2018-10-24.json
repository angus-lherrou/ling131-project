we're in the process of having them do that kind of a double check\nNo dry out or something yeah because you know every day that goes by you're going to be more and more trouble in your situation so that's great news just hopefully as a short lived issue\nOkay because in other words I think I think you're gonna be able to get insurance I just don't know exactly when or what it's going to cost that's the other thing you've gotta look at where he could be unreasonable but I'm diabetes is a real tough\nDiagnosis for life insurance really tough so um anyway\nThe answer your question overall is if someone's uninsured well yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental\nCaution overall is if someone's uninsured well yes you would keep accidental death at forty something years old you know the probability is accidental it would be your cause a\nExcept that you've had the diabetes issue um but otherwise I mean you you statistically that'd be the cause we don't recommend accidental death as you know but it's better than having no insurance\nRight so yeah I Would keep it and it's not that expensive because it's kind of gimmick insurance is what it is a definitely would keep any term or any whole life or anything that's in place as long as you can keep it don't okay you know to the very last moment and if you're a term ... is expiring see if they have you checked to see if they have a renewal and non medical renewal\nNo I have not I didn't know about those\nSometimes they do\n\nThank you for joining us and we're glad your phone just for like eight to five\nFive two to five Chelsea is in Los Angeles how Chelsea how're you\nDoing good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up in your world\nI had a question for you in regards to um\nHourly pay versus salary my my husband has traditionally been tricked position where they're going to be giving him a pay raise but with that pay raise their on saying that he also has that they're going to be transitioning him into salary pay if she usually works between five and twenty hours of overtime each week\nSo I wanted to make sure that when he they haven't given him an a from Africa get fed when they do want it to make sure that\nHow would you how would you recommend\nTo calculate whether\nThat the salary rate is comparable with for example the hours that he was working before and the pay that he would get what overtime\nWhich sounds like it would be simple you've been working Fifteen to twenty hours a week last year extra and you've been paid for that and overtime correct correct and show what was his income last year including the overtime\nWith about forty thousand\nAnd how will that compared to the salary\nBut that's the part that we don't know yet\nConservative shower really read it at the salary is fifty that's raised if the salary is forty five and the same number of hours or expect to be work it's effectively a pay cut\nRight\nYes that makes sense it's like\nYeah like as we were I was kind of weird because it was just more if it were in the ... member to um I I Know that he has the potential to work more hours so because of that I was kind of\nVery yeah but but the question was the question is not just more hours the question is is this a good deal for him apples to apples not a ... and ... and has he got the chance to move up in the company because he moved to salary\nYes he's going to be moving to management because it shows\nNo but I mean further up later oh okay but let's say let's say they offer him fifty five as a salary or sixty is a salary will we be dancing wouldn't we\nYeah\nOkay yeah 'cause that's what we're getting paid a lot more and I'm working the same number of hours you know it's like it's almost like he picked up more hours but didn't have to work on usually what I'm saying but it but again if they want to give him a salary and act like they did him a favor and it's been and he gets paid forty\nBut he's working in the same number of hours working when he's making forty eight then that's not a blessing\nYeah they're just making sense to you yeah that makes sense\nIf it's even if it's forty eight to forty eight we still like the salary because of the upward potential\nOkay\nLong term to long term good career movies moving into leadership and the management and that's where he wants to head towards long term\nBut I'm ... you know\nYes but but again you just compare it to last year's income so the whole thing comes down to how does it compare to forty eight thousand what's this hour because that's what he was making working the hours that he's going to continue to be working apparently\nChris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how're you\nDoing good they taking my call sure what's up\nThey continue to be working apparently Chris is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing good they taking my call sure what's up\n[noise] uh well right now I'm a I'm like income about thirty one thousand dollars a year [noise] I've got a fourteen hundred dollars in credit card debt or about eleven thousand a student loan debt that it ah that that about six months ago was\nA lot about Nineteen thousand [laughter] I've been working working hard and saved my money and paying it off as much as I can good\nOr bad cuts right now I came up with the idea for an invention ... and I don't know whether to keep you know steam rolling my debt plan and doing all that are just you know kind of jumped ship and say hey this is something that could you know be my future and potentially mhm\n[laughter] so I mean it kind of want a young lady of financial advice from you\nKnow what to do with the remaining dead I have ... and yeah my aspirations because I'm In the process I've been saving to uh get a VA home loan now is just about there so [noise] any advice you can give me I'd be greatly appreciative right\nWell I'm going to avoid buying the home until I got the debt cleared the only question is then how can we start working on the invention idea and make some money now because we don't need to make a a bunch of money five years from now we need some money today\nOne of them twenty thousand dollars a day so the invention you came up with as a physical product\nYes there is a a odor the odor either slash a mold a real small machine that um people getting on their own\nOkay and you've made one\nI've made a very um rudimentary crowded type ... the next the next phase I've got is like either dip into my rainy day fund started coming in my regular cash flow and like buying a computer and get my three D. modeling\nAnd get me a couple of silicon prototypes so I can go you know take it to a you know take the next level or what I Want to do so again Dr\nJump off my my debt plan more do I have his mind Vinton okay um\nWell what you're talking about you could spend anywhere from twenty five dollars to a two hundred and fifty thousand dollars on it there's really no in between I mean you could just go anywhere you want to go with this there's a lot of money to be spent on something like this\nAnd if you were a billionaire and you you know what you would do is you would build a couple of 'em and you get them out there and test them and make sure that they work and that you there was a market for it before you went into production\nBecause you don't go into production on prototypes that are on tested or from an R and D standpoint or you don't go into production on something that I've got no market for it not been able to sell it\nBecause you're going to let you make a hundred thousand of them and having them in your basement if you had unlimited sums ever be able to sell them\nYou know I'd like trying to ah continue to do with the way you're doing it and that's just piece it together and let's build one and let's find somebody to put one in there in the property and a commercial applications\nAnd let's say let me give me just let's just make up a pretend example okay here will be like your ideal thing you build one or two in your garage and you convince these guys look this looks rough we're not looking at the the form of it we're looking at the function of it I just want to show you that the idea works\nAnd if the ideal works than what I'm going to want you to this place in order for ten of them or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside\nUm or thirty of them or a hundred of them for for all of your locations okay and you find somebody like that that's got an upside to test it and then if a place that order that just plays such a pause it with you large enough to build the order\n... and it finds itself\nThat's called organically cash flowing something in other words you you prove it to somebody who's going to be a big customer and they place an order with enough of a deposit to fill the manufacturer your first order out\n... they think I should down down uh my rather than just spend all my extra capital towards paying out my credit card debt and I've been on that\nI don't think you have to spend much capital on this you've already you're already built one in the garage yeah build another one okay maybe a couple of hundred bucks right\n[noise] well I keep it in that but I I just see I'm a ... I Want it to be you know a good good like I'm proud of\nThat so now it's a ... there are no perfect sense [laughter] very very purpose of a prototype despite all the crap that's broken [laughter] you're not going to get it perfect\nYou're going to put it out there in the in the marketplace is going to kick it around and you're going to learn form and function changes and form and function changes in the ... which has to be on that side in this which has to be made out of this instead of that and you're only going to learn that if you beat up about a hundred of them but let's get two of them in somebody's restaurant\nIn there to restaurants and they got a hundred they can put them in later are two of them in somebody's industrial application and they've got um you know they've got forty more they will order if it works because it's the best thing since sliced bread I got to have the ... I'm ...\nAnd then they give you enough money\nIn there a deposit for the initial order for you to your manufacturing and basically you got almost nothing out of pocket\nExcept your brain power and you're sweating and your smile out there selling it and that's how a lot of these things get off the ground a way a lot of people lose a lot of money on them is they go into mass production before something is proven either the marketplace for the actual prototype\nAnd you're talking to a guy who's lost money that way the stupid stuff so [noise] do easy man go easy this was the day Ramsey show [noise]\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live um in in our city\nEighteen hours you know instead of binge watching TV and keeping up with the ...

things are term life insurance and\nDisability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen preterm life you need to carry ten to twelve times your income and I recommend Fifteen or twenty year plans for most families stay away from cash value or return a premium plans there just a rip off\nDisability

at it when it's gone I talked to the next one down when it's gone attack than actual down that's called the debt snowball and that is the most efficient way and the most of the highest probability way to get out of student loan debt\nVery fast and very hard do not get into income based repayment plans do not get into I'm going to pay the minimum occupied occupy the freaking maximum you can pay

your\nAnd the clippers ditch penalties and taxes but you never borrow money thirty five percent answers to fund your baby step\nOne no no no no no no no or would you use that to pay off debt thirty five percent hit no no\nWell they told me they're only ... percent out that's all they're required to withhold but that's not the calculation of how much the government\nKeeps you in the seats the government keeps you in the teeth out of ten percent penalty plus your tax rate you do not gay shout retirement accounts\nUnless it's to avoid bankruptcy or a foreclosure of its save your home yeah or if you're so far in debt it's the only way you keep them from bankruptcy yeah you would do that but at that point you're beyond desperate you're in deep weeds you know\nBut definitely not never catch it out to buy a car or you know is is that kind of stupid stuff that people do all the time\nNo never never\nAnd I was with us in Washington DC Hi Anna how are you\n[laughter] Hi Dave I'm doing well\nThank you for taking my question sure I'm so into that than six my husband and I purchased our first home and too often that ate the market crash and slash\nThe value of our house now three years ago our family grew and we bought a new home twenty percent down it's in twelve years now and I'll first home it's still not war for worry about it for and we\nWait a minute wait a minute that that's not economic there's something else going on\nIran few places in the United states has not recovered after twelve years would you buy it and I read or what\nI I don't understand it either 'cause we live in northern Virginia which is like very close to Washington DC and right now it's worth two hundred and Ninety five\nK they bought it at um according to my ... and we bought the house at three hundred and fifty K.\nA recent comparative market analysis by quality real estate agent says this house is worth three hundred grand\nOkay is that what you're telling me yes\nSo you must have done the world's worst real estate deal\nI I that will likely satellite I we bought the house and two bath and is sick you know what I own it up and an eighth [laughter] I'm Sorry that you owe on it\n[noise] um right now we owe about sixty K on it\nOh Charlotte you think well we should sell it it's crap the world's worst house well we\nHad to do it so much\nSo you don't think we should wait

other debts but\nI mean you love this car if you want but I don't love the score it's a stupid car and it's killing you your numbers are horrendous on this um\nIf you have more than half of your income tied up in cars or things with motors in them all totaled up then you have too much of your lifetime up and things that are going down in value and you're always going to struggle\nIt's causing you to be middle class or lower middle class socio economically speaking financially speaking and it's all because of a choice of what you're choosing to drive\nI Would not choose to drive that I

a slave to the lender is right that's a pretty impressive stuff gosh wow very cool so what do you tell people that key to getting out of debt is\nOh that's a that's a great question um one thing I can say is\nYou have to be committed a once you agree to do something you have to be committed to do it and and you have to see beyond your current situation you have to see what you want to be more than you see where you are ...\nSo once you can see beyond that then you can start to dream a and and there's many times where we actually drove through neighborhoods and looked at is a nice houses and say you know when we do this right we can go pick a house we can do that but we wanted to do it right\nKnow I thought about that sharing and I used to do that we would go drive the rich neighborhood and
