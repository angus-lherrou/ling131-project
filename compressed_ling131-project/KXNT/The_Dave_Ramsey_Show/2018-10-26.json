household income is what I'm just under a hundred thousand okay and you I'm\nA U.S how much debt Seventy five thousand [noise] okay um\nI mean it's not a deal breaker it's seven hundred and fifty dollars and the thing that sharing and I did when we were looking at things like that was we would if we found one thing like that that we were going to not cut to get our debt free go we had to find something else we were going to cut\nDeeper okay so like that means that if you were going to cheat and go out to eat once a month now you're not gotcha or the if you thought you were going to do X

[noise]\n\n[noise]\n\nBut you were doing the lives of the day room\n... is with us in Jackson, Mississippi hey Carl how are you\nDoing very well thank you for taking my call sure what's up [noise] well um I think ... is that um there's three in the household is my husband and myself and my dad passed away two years ago so mom I moved in with us [noise] so um she couldn't\nMake it on her own so we just kind of combine our income um our monthly income with three of us combined is thirty four hundred and forty two dollars I've done the everyday dollar budget and we're\nLike forty seven dollars I'm not over budget as things stand now um\nWe had back in January we had some identity theft going on in our account and that it is almost twelve to Fifteen hundred dollars in the ... that the bank to for over a draft and stuff so that could\nMean why why did the bank charge you anything if there was a ... to\nBe well it was um I ... that was charged to our account\nI Know but if it's identity of the banks shouldn't be charging you anything\nWell they did and they said there was nothing they can do about it a rock and change things\nYeah we did okay wait we actually closed banking and we just have a debit card that um it's like one of those little Walmart hard you know so we don't even go through the banks anymore it's just a debit card\nBut um they charge us like\nNearby six hundred dollars and overdraft mhm and they wouldn't take them back mhm mhm but I'm hearing that\nThat because that was going on we got in on our house payment\nAnd I'm ... thanks for the smaller ... we had what we call the smaller nice but we're still have a hand on our house I've got to the housing loan people and they're working with is that we're having to pay extra\nA month on our mortgage payment\nSure how old are you guys fifty nine so I'm fifty nine and a thick the mom Seventy nine\nOr you guys on some kind of a fixed income for some reason\nThe disability out three of us and none of you were able to work no I Do a little sad business witchcraft and things like that what is the nature of your disability\nUm is a hip displacement what's wrong with him um he had um a as a and broke his back uh-huh and he has a I'm facing the bone in close to his nerves sack mhm\nAnd he also had a triple bypass surgery a few years ago when he has a defeat the later and he's got like twenty five percent of his heart beating so\nMhm okay um\nWell what what you guys have more than anything else is an income crisis right due to the fixed income and that's why I was exploring the question that does sound like you've got some pretty serious limitations\nUm but what I'm going to do if I'm In your shoes is what you kind of started doing there with the crowds\nAnd even in his shoes are obviously none of you all are going to be involved in physical labor of any kind right okay but if there was something that you could\nDo like I talked to a lady the other day who was just going to garage sales and she was buying clothing for a quarter Anna Nicole and selling it on ... for a dollar and two dollars ... she had done that like ten thousand times and made like ten thousand dollars\nMhm okay\nAnd that didn't involve any heavy lifting obviously and involve the keystrokes on the computer to set up an account and sell some stuff on ... I'm not saying that's what you do I'm just saying that something like that that is\nThat that that is in the line with the limitations that you guys have because if we can add a thousand dollars a month only your world it would change your life\nMhm wouldn't it it was really a yes or will be dramatic and how old is mom mom is Seventy nine and how much of this thirty four forty two comes from her eleven forty seven yeah she passes away you don't get a real problem correct\nSo we've got to solve some of the income issue one way or another here um and how much is your house payment\nUm they were four Seventy eight they've increased it to five\nAnd it was that's one of those on your let's just do the taxes and insurance going up ... ... you know and what's the home worse oh it's worth a shot at a hundred and ten a hundred and ... we only twelve\nFive ... oh my goodness yeah well I sure would be good when [noise] mhm yeah\nSo I think more than anything that the the magic one here is some kind of an idea\nFor you to create some income and I don't know what that is but I Want the three of you to sit around and talk about what you could do a you're obviously not going to do anything this physical I get that you got some serious limitations I understand that\nAnd I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but it man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole\nI understand that and I'm not picking on you know I'm just trying to help you uh but it man a thousand dollars a month would change your whole life\nThousand dollars a month for a year and you pay that house off\nAnd that'd be rid of that payment and then when mom passes you're not in a problem and right now you being a serious problem two thousand dollars a month income change\nYou'd feel like you were rich like you were a multi millionaires or something it would change your life that much\nAnd so in is that possible yes that is possible it's very possible but you need some income ideas some things you can do jump and it's probably something you jump on the computer and sell something or\nWhatever and again it done I don't want to put a bunch of strain on you physically but um you know I'm having an intelligent conversation with you over the phone so you could have an intelligent conversation with somebody over the phone and sell them something\nAnd that that's possible thing you can do um the you know and it doesn't cause you to\nWork forty hours a week necessarily but if you could do anything that creates a thousand two thousand dollars a month it would change your world and that's that's really what I Would work on rather than try to solve the forty seven dollar problem\nThat you've got what that is a symptomatic of the fact that you're struggling with income and legitimately ... you're struggling it's my pleasure lazy or something like that but it just hand\nIf you could come up with any kind of a small business idea that your husband than you could do together um and just get them to get the needle to move a little bit here\nThan it would change everything for you and thank you for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Benjamin is in Oklahoma City Hi Benjamin how are you\nAt Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] so my wife and I graduated college about a little over a year ago\nCool and we got a good job good and bought a house good\nAnd I'm Wondering and your eyes or does it come on dad what are we paid it off about\nHalf the Price Floyd okay I'm\nI'm Wondering in your eyes or your parents

it\nNow I was actually the one the only kids faster than Sharon ... who she won but I'm\nA I I don't think that there's a financial manager other than just being completely crazy like if you don't have sixteen kids if you're broke that stupid okay that is crazy but are you guys are in great shape your sharp young couple whenever you're ... whenever you're emotionally in relation to be ready to have kids and God says is okay to have kids\nGo have kids I I don't I don't tell people they need to be out of debt and have their emergency when there's not a baby step for kids\nUm you know you don't have to be a certain place you're going to be fine a child is not going to destroy your life financially or as a matter of fact you probably won't even hardly notice\nEverybody talks about oh children to go five hundred and sixty two thousand dollars to raise yeah really not really they eat the same broccoli you eat after a certain point\nThere in early in the same warm house you're already in after a certain point\nAnd so the actual cost of a kid is just not that it's not devastating but again you don't want to just load up a whole house full of them if you're broke and that that will cause a problem but to decide to have your first couple of children I mean it's that's not something that's between you and God and your wife\nAnd you guys are in good shape financially

happy I Am having a good day sure I Am how can I Know I'm just starting your program and I'm not sure how to do it when there is no\n\nThank you for joining us America ... is with us in Singapore say a larger how are you [noise]\nA record ... good afternoon how are you doing better than I deserve out going to hell\nYes so first of all\nYeah so our first of all I'd like to thank you for everything you're doing a sense I started listening to actually have a few dollars truck together great um\nMy question is basically about I'm a ... a voluntary retirement scheme that um is and send up ... so I can put up to thirty five and seven thirty five thousand seven hundred dollars a year and I would get tax relief on that\nBut at the calendar year ... which translates to about four thousand dollars in taxes mhm now I Want to take half my emergency fund\nAnd put it into that account because I might not reached a thirty six thousand jumps cash blowing that somebody's salary\nMhm what are the penalties for growing ... shoot I Do that one of the penalties for withdrawing I don't read for what\n... yeah it's about fifty for ... a ... percent on taxes are but I I really don't need the entire\nEmergency fund I currently have thirty thousand a month to keep taking Fifteen thousand input into that I can rebuild my retirement my emergency\nFound in about three months\nIf you don't need it why would you rebuild it\n\nI mean I don't have to have all the thirty thousand I just built it because I feel very comfortable with having that as a cushion\nRight and what is your income a year\n\nAbout a hundred and sixty\nOkay so what is three to six months of expenses\n\nIt it is about to join the free thousand\nOkay that would be ... that'd be three months or six months\nThat will be six months\nOkay All right so you can be within the range of three to six months of expenses at Fifteen thousand\nAnd um if you want to use some of that money that's fine and if you want to build it back up to six months later that's fine but it doesn't sound like you need more than twenty five thousand ever in your emergency fund\nYes but I'm not a citizen here\nI've also not a U.S citizen I'm\nI work here I'm an ex patriot and I just feel more comfortable because if I Need to leave the country I have about sixty days to get all my affairs in order and leave\nMhm\nOkay so you're just gonna keep a little extra will show went out and that's why I feel and what happens if that ... that event occurs a while you're down on cash because you've funded this thing\n\nSo it's very unlikely um I just received and your role and at least for the next two years I'm probably very safe at my work life\nMhm yeah\nWell the thing is is here here's what's bothering me is the proper amount to have in your emergency fund it's thirty thousand dollars and the answer is no\nDon't drain it down because this is not an emergency you use emergency funds for emergencies period if the proper amount to have in your emergency fund\nWhich means you should end up there is Fifteen thousand twenty thousand then don't have more than that later\nSo you decide what the proper amount in an emergency fund is when all the smoke clears but don't tell me you're using your emergency fund to fund this and then you're going to put it back\nWhich tells me you don't agree you know you've got your mind the proper amounts thirty grand I think is what you're saying and so the answer is no\nDon't put the money and retirement don't use your emergency money to do that but if you're with\nSeeing over funded I'm going to back it down in the twenty range than I might go ahead and do this deal\nA because we're not there but but if you think you need to keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies didn't keep thirty thousand dollars around for emergencies\nAnd don't monkey with it is merge and she found this is is foundational before you move on to investing of any kind so you got to decide your definition that's what I was poking around on I'm trying to figure out what you really need slash one and it sounds like emotionally\nGiven the unusual situation that you are and you want to keep thirty grand around and so you should keep thirty grand around\nThat's it don't mess with that but if not if you're going to permanently lower it then use some of that money to do this then hey I'm just fine with that a cage is with us in Salt Lake City Hi cage how are you\nHey Dave how's it going better than I deserve what's up\nHey thanks for taking my call today I'm I'm a college student I'm two semesters away from graduating with my bachelor's degree in finance um but the more that I go through school and the more that I listen to you\nAnd makes me want to I'm really make a living being a financial ... many years ago and still here today [noise]\nUm so I was just wondering I Want to get your advice on whether you think it still possible for somebody like me to run their type of fitness that may be your advice on the best isn't this model to maximize success on the early going up starting\nOkay well the um you know the based financial coaching where you pay someone pays you a fee just to sit down and do one on one coaching which we do some here and we go we we have a program where we sort of our people that do that that come through our training to do that\nIs it's difficult to make a living exclusively doing that\nUh because it's it's a very much uh the inventory is your hours in the day and you have to sell enough of your hours in the day for enough money to equal a good living\nAnd I it can be done but are coming straight out of school difficult to do\nI'm not saying that can't be done but I'm just saying it's not it's not a slam dunk okay it's not an eighty thousand dollar your job your first or two years out\nIt's going to take you a while to build up the thing you could do is you could go into the financial services world like on the brokerage side and work with someone like one of our smart Mr prose as an example and those guys are in the business gals are in the business of selling investments\nAnd there's nothing there's ... there's nothing that preempts you as a matter of fact it it's almost paramount that you do coach people while you're selling them an investment so that they don't get into the wrong investment you're teaching them you're helping them make decisions\nBut in the process of doing that then you know you're making a commission and there's nothing wrong with that it's like when you're selling some on a home near coaching them into this house is going to you know it's going to be pretty you know based on your income is is a really out of your ranger coaching someone if you're a realtor and telling them that you're in a sense your financial coaching them\nAnd so but you get paid a commission when they buy a house\nAnd so uh you know this idea that some people have that everybody gets paid a commission as a conflict of interest and keeps them from doing the right thing by their clients is absolutely absurd there's plenty of people on strike commission with high levels of integrity to do the right thing\nSo you might explore that angle because truthfully you can make more doing that then you can just\nDoing a book building by the hour and I'm not saying making more is the whole answer but you know as a as a young guy coming straight out of school as a financial coach you probably gonna have to get a little bit of miles on your before people are going to\nYou you know\nStraight out of school as a financial coach you probably don't have to get a little bit of a mile zone you before people are going to trust you\nYou know I could be I mean there's some people trust you and if you're really good you know you're no you're stuff than you'll you'll get business but ah I'm just saying it's it's a tough road\nTo just do what we did back in the day and it's one of the reasons is not is one of the reasons we quit doing that as or exclusively what we did\nYou know we started doing events we started having a class where we started\nDoing other stuff to go with it um because it's difficult to make a scale up when there's only so many hours in the day you can fill out an hourly rate open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Amy is on Facebook dot coms life day

host of the ... of our Ramsey solutions media productions and thrilled to be sitting in for Dave this hour triple eight eight to five five two to five Tripoli eight to five five two to five is the number to jump in and let's go to Cody who's on the line in Seattle, Washington Cody how can I\nCan thank you for taking my call so I'm about five years and she my career field and I cheat on cyber security and um I currently make\nA hundred and five thousand a year um I completed all of the baby stops I don't have a wife or a kid\nA and then this past all yes I've been given an opportunity to take a job got is stable\nEither in a full time and it pays a approximately three hundred thousand a year a tiger effect here to ... uh I've I've been very split\nYou know try to keep a stable job um you know you you're on five days a week and make sure you know you get your paycheck and um but\nI I think since I'm pretty young and I don't really have you know an octave support a family or anything I was just curious what your thoughts were on our either saying at my job or take a look\nField itself I I enjoy doing it um I don't consider going a job but like a Chihuahua or anything like that I I I enjoy it so yeah I'm a opportunity to ah to take the other one is pretty exciting\nYeah okay that's great that's that's one question the other question is when you say stability you said you're going to make three hundred thousand dollars that's a massive that's over half\nOkay you're two times what you're making OK so where's the stability she meaning that you're not going to have normal hours but you're still going to make three hundred K. that I understand you correctly\nYeah so um I I ... I basically work it out for like a twenty hour work week and I multiply that by the hourly rate so IT consulting so uh you know I can have worked for three weeks and then I can be I have no work for you know months on end\nYeah but you're going to make three hundred K. that's pretty clear correct\nAll that that even if I get twenty or twenty hours a week okay got it on the earth All right\nBut is there is some question as to whether or not that's going to be consistent is that a moderate goal or can a conservative goal or an aggressive goal the twenty hours a week\n... ... that's pretty moderate um 'cause I I've spoken with some of the other people that work in my position on 'em and they they say that a fact about average um yeah OK yet but they may have some months for they they get a paycheck and\nYou know but ... this is a no brainer because you're completely debt free you've already gone all the way through baby steps seven you have no wife and kids I mean you're in great shape to take this opportunity and and here's the other thing you've probably planned for it how what is your uh three to six month emergency fund look like how big is\nThat that Fifteen thousand\nYeah I mean juice out a little bit how long would it take you to get up to thirty or fifty you know ...\nWhat fighter position\nYeah or just in this new position because you're in such good because you're such good shape you you know just taking a new position you can stack up some money and take you know my point is is let's say you get into this new role would you really want to take and I'm telling you to take it\nBut let's say you're feeling that the first three months live on way less you already can anyway so the new job is actually going allow you to maybe put six months away\nSo you've got no risk at all because you can jump back in the cyber security I think it's a no brainer I think you're over thinking it because it's not the forty hour week buddy you did all the hard work to get to the point where you can take a job like this you don't have to work forty hours a week\nOkay you got me yeah\nSo I maybe as celebrate tonight my goodness don't overseeing this I mean half of half of the ice is going to love to be worked ... right now [laughter] I mean bloody this is the kind of smart risk you know because you put yourself in a great financial situation to be able to go after this is really hardly any risk at all um\nMan and and here's the deal you're saying that you all you have to do is get twenty hours a week\nAnd that would put your three hundred K. if you only do ten you're still going to be making about the same it's not even a little bit more of course you'll be making more so again go go go oh that is fun stuff AAA eight to five five two to five just as a career seem out on the day Ramsey show I'm Ken Coleman city and for day to go to Rachel who's on the line in Madison, Wisconsin right talking about\nHow campaigns like hockey nature I'm I'm twenty four years old and right now and we're working in the legal industry and I got a lawyer play a role and they're catching coordinator so basically I'm working with Frank Lloyd how coordinate their program driving my ankle ... however I don't want to work\nIn court Nader's co basically I'm working with different marred to help coordinate their program Dr Engel my ongoing ... however I don't want to work in lido administration I Want to work in a different industry\n... thing my current job would give me a transferable skills how long should I stay and well let's lay down job ... and if I only stay wind or two years in an expedition\nYou know you almost like a job hopping at all how old are you at twenty\nFour okay twenty four I forgot to write that down so here's the deal you're pretty much the average millennial who looks at a job we knew this from data that looks at a job is no more than about twelve months so first of all that's out there and it's not job hopping suck you left after six months\nYou've been ah in the legal world and you now know very specifically where you want to go so congratulations of being twenty four\nAnd and knowing where you want to end up\nSo uh the first question you asked me are your skills\nThat you have manifested in learned in the legal industry transferable to the business industry and the answer is absolutely yes\nStew a quick example here tell me a two or three or four things that you do really well right now in your job if I interviewed your co workers and your leaders what would they told me that Rachel does very well right now go\nUm I Would have his thumb arm and conferences and then\nProbably ... or one in a bigger all very big jogger to figure out who's doing what program and then on the other side of of
