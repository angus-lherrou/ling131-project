opinion a\nSecond opinion wait a second opinion about what\n[laughter] well it's because it's been a year and a half and I had a ... an insurance policy\nRight that's exactly what they're for\nRight back out and not wanting to paying for it gets to know ... one of the injury with a broken which we can All right and ...\nAll right so they got it and they don't show the your own insurance company does not want to pay for additional injuries now I'm assuming you haven't settled yet correct\nYes I have met the alright I wanted to be able to go to court for the other men\nCan't do it you know you got the minimum policy that's it that's all you're going to get is the minimum\n... are you now you have a\nYou have one ensure motorist and how much is the medical on the uninsured motors\nIs the minimum paying their it's only one person\nOr wait a minute Fifteen that's liability that's not uninsured motorists that's the other side you're you're you're confusing year you're making me can you\nKnow that mine now since he's Fifteen sorority is your liability\n\nAlright then you've got your own medical\nOr that the uninsured motorists pay that you have a comprehensive polish at\nThat time for them out\nAnd got it All right and so All right All right watch okay firing up you get Fifteen thousand dollars a medical insurance company will pay\nAnd uh they're they're willing to pay the Fifteen thousand\nTen thousand med team\nGo ahead and I'm like for the other\nYou know I understand the insurance company is saying no they're not willing to pay though what you're claiming that you do your road\nI get it so what's your question insurance companies who says no we're not going to pay that amount of money we're going to give you this and they offer you any money yet at all well they have not and it's been a year and a half ago yeah but you're but you're still treating correct\nYes then another one I have to pay for treatment and there are other than that I read that but um I\nI'm All right but there wasn't any more than what they're not going to pay beyond the Fifteen thousand\nRight they have not only that are offered that amount\nAll right then you then what you end up is you end up suing your own insurance company under the uninsured motors policy\n[laughter] well I was going to the first one that\nI Know but what good is that do\nWell he would have been I'm sure the right to life for the family so\nWhere do you think you're going to get money from ... how much money you think you're going to pay you uninsured no license\nI don't know but my question [laughter] when I had for doubt and I was going to melt lead but when I met with a clip the crooked and said they had all that so I planned on file and at night to have information\nOh God what why you don't need any of that you have if you're already in touch with the insurance company insurance company is already accept the fact you're not liable is that correct yeah\nAll right so that are only ... not only talking or the damages and your insurance company doesn't want to pay Fifteen thousand bucks okay so you're turning around and sue them now you can sue the other driver\nOr who will of course not answer or you'll get a judgment and ah then when you don't collect your judgment venue to your own insurance company three years down the road to just go to your own insurance company and say here\nAt this point it's forget the other driver your insurance company will go after the other driver under a subordinate shouldn't claws\n[laughter] what what I found out and filed\nBy matter at this point yeah I Know I Know but almost never us our ah one's filed and by the way for people that don't know where it's are ones you have to file there's more than five hundred dollars with the damages both sides have to firewood and with the DMV and who cares\nA war with the state of California I don't even know what agency you probably would doesn't matter so let's get away from me I saw one cause that changes nothing\nRight what you have is you have a driver who was uninsured you're uninsured motorists that will not pay for the damages your policy you're saying no we're not going to pay you that much and they haven't made an offer in a year and a half\nRight and so you sue them has trained\nAnd they go to sue them right now you show them oh what's that what you're saying what what what did you hear me say\nFor them that's correct that's it uh-huh\nOh okay excellent thanks for listening you're a wonderful human being that was the only time insurance companies say no\nNo not even that much I Want five thousand give you a thousand but but what do I do you still don't know I\nBelieve me insurance companies fight all the time fight on the uninsured motorists

back and forth so I went if I can play a critical ... or ... or three there for a long look at the ballot with because I didn't quite as to\nWhat was it well you're you're talking about your license plate was stolen\nNot that Ficre Hervey went out to\nYou you you say it was stolen\n[noise] well I think they know what selling\nSo how do you know how do you know ...\n... what they got the ticket that was what I figure out well and they have to do it they\nMay have been so yeah it may have been stolen how about you just didn't put the sticker on\n[noise] no I I put a thick on on my car\nOkay so uh so when you got a ticket for not having your sticker on the license plates or they ticketed you for not having your sticker on your license plate even though you put it on you say\nYes I Am because his daughter which I wasn't aware\nOf what was so and I don't understand the sticker was stolen from whom by whom\nThink I may I just do it from the license plate\nOh why oh why you weigh one took the sticker off your license plate\nOr I don't even play yeah\nOkay got it and that was confusing as hell think are claiming that one up for me oh God limit the time limit time okay and the court just didn't believe it because you didn't put a police report right\nYeah okay my plate of course I didn't I wasn't I think it All right and now what what's your question\nAnd it's all about and listen to their response was that they took a picture of the like a play on a ... ... they said that someone else would have taken not afraid of credit\nAll right what's your so what's your question like question is should pay and forget about yeah what I yeah I mean what how much is a ticket\nMy question is should pay and forget\nAbout yeah well yeah I mean what how much is a ticket I think it's a ... couple of dollars are going to be a lot more than I you know what here you go to court I Would just pay it but\nHere you may have an argument and you go in front of a judge and you go your honor here's what happened a B C and D and uh they said we should have filed a police report who helped ... over a stolen sticker\nOn a license plate because once I put the sticker on the license plate like every other human being in the world who pays attention anymore\nBecause I think my first check it every day\nYeah exactly I think I think paying it's a different decision defense a shirt tell it to a judge 'cause the words that happens you have to pay for the ticket anyway\nYeah well I mean that's the worst of it so it it's worth half a day in court and then you get to see traffic court and you get to see these other people come up with the most insane defenses you've ever seen and and the fun one where ah the people come up and they said you'll see with an explanation\nAnd I that the court to freeze which which the court will do and then you start trying to figure out how much money this person has stolen a from your loved one yeah it's no fun when that happens ...\nDavid Hi game right

getting a year\nOr a thirty grand was leasing and my cousin gave me twelve and he'd keep uh uh actually I got eleven like eleven thousand eight hundred different so how did it work that he got more money than you I was an idiot and the\nOkay there's no good reason for him to get more money than you you were just in you know can okay because\nIn those ... now now in those four years I just want you know I was the one that they always contacted support for the summer I Would go and do the right\nOkay so here's the so the bottom line you get to see who your cousin and your cousins defense is going to be hot gee we don't have any signed contracts your argument is going to be yeah but then why do we don't have a signed contract why did you pay me a over four years but what if\nWhat if I don't want to see my cousin and what if I thought I did I I spoke with the DEA is one of the restaurant and I explained the situation unfortunately they're caught in the middle but I told them I owned the copyright that software\nOkay so right and right now you're you're infringing on those copyright\nI'll actually not because there was a contract or that they have and it's not CBS to screw you is your cousin that's screwing you and I saw one has a written contract and you're saying there was a written contracts between your cousin and CBS correct\nYes and yet but in that contract there's nowhere there is no car there's nothing that states I'm releasing my copyright\nYou have to be like but the point is that\nYou're allowing him to use it sounded question releasing the copyright it's a question if we we have a deal you can go ahead and use it a verbal deal you go ahead and use it so what do you want to do if you can't do the kind of say what what would you like\nI Want what I Want to see the stop using the software\nI I don't know if you can start you can stop it now you can make a motion to have CBS and then there was a lawsuit by the end\nStop using the software I I don't know if you can start you can stop it now you can make a motion to have CBS and then there was a lawsuit about interference with a contract that they may have\nBut I tell you you go ahead and sue C B a CBS you've gotta you gotta world of hurt and what are you going to do your you're going to send them at the cease and desist saying you can't use the software anymore\nBecause uh I'm being ripped off and they're going to say we're not ripping you off you talk to your cousin but I don't want us to my cousin well that's too bad yeah OK\nYeah basically basically it's\nLike why wouldn't you want to sue your cousin who's left wing you David because\nIt because it's going to cause more family problems I Believe you know\nI don't know if you're you are an idiot across several different levels I was going to cause a family problems if someone's stealing or stealing from me and I want to go after the wrongdoers I Can't because it's going to cost family problems some they're going to get upset
