D\n[noise]\nLove your show him with us from Montana Hi Shaun how are you\nIn your soap better than I deserve what's up for\nA let me just lay down situation are you a question I'll get to the question if that's OK okay a\nCredit weighing the job I have I make like twenty two three year uh me and my wife of nine thousand three hundred and forty\nTwo dollars in debt mhm oh what do you do I'm a direct care professional\nYou're a what\nA direct care so I take care of people who are ah developmentally disabled and work on behavioral stuff and\nYou make twenty two thousand dollars a year ... okay\nSo ah\nBasically I have an opportunity to and what are you located from where I Am in Montana back to Boston which is where I'm from\n...\nAnd the single job would double my income\nMhm [noise]\nBut in doing so I Would not be bringing my family with me at first I had the opportunity to stay rent free with my father and work\nMhm why would that worried her family her with you\nUm affordability I Can't afford to move them I mean we're barely even have a foundation to rule of thumb dollars to start paying offered to I mean right now I'm dealing with like negative cash flow\nDoes your wife work outside the home\nOkay yeah All right and do you own a home when we were at okay\nAnd uh so basically you get a loan your furniture into a U Haul and pull it across the country and be in Boston and get an apartment right\n[noise] um well and the long haul yes the short term I Would try a plane ticket wow load your wife up and go\nUh I wouldn't have the money to put them in an apartment mhm okay\nSo uh you're going to be making twice as much though so how quickly would you be moving them\nA wall she's pregnant with our fair show the thought process would be in the summer probably August after birth\nNo I'm not doing that I'm not leaving my pregnant wife and four kids halfway around the dad gum world and go live with your dad not a chance I'm quoting her up and move and do\nAs your what can you can have your family help you a little bit of animal costs much to get moved maybe the employer would give the new employer will give you an advance to get you moved into your new apartment\n\nUm there's a possibility with that\nYeah you need a load up your family and get out of there\nBut you know not being with your pregnant wife while she's carrying what your fifth child you're in Boston and she's in Montana dude that is not okay [laughter]\nI mean you're not in the military or not you're not required to be separated like that you're just making bad choices\nNow you need ... you described together a few dollars and go deliver some pizzas or something and ah for a month and and pile up you know thousand Fifteen hundred bucks and get you a U Haul and get your button gear and enroll loan over to a Boston and take that job\nOr move in with your dad for a month with the whole dad gummed crew over there if you can something like that I mean you need to find a different way but this idea you're going to lay bringing your whole\nFamily and while your wife is getting no no no\nThat's not going to work out for you that's going to end poorly I can assure you may links for calling in ban is one of those bands in Colorado Springs hey Ben how are you\nYeah and how you behave better than I deserve what's up\nThere I Am self employed I'm a real estate agent and um we've got the thousand dollars for your baby steps wide\nAnd art that they were were\nKind of a crossroads on how to how to go up to about going on with the next babysat I'm of the opinion which isn't in your plan\nThat you know because I'm self employed and money isn't always there I Need to have oh you know two two months or so of income to fall back on in ... to be able to make the budget\nThat does your wife work like\nShe does not she's a stay at home mother\nAnd are you so you're not make any money in the real estate business\nWell I'm a I'm not making a hundred thousand a hundred and ten thousand a year somewhere in there they are not having the row months\nNot any zero month or during the winter in Colorado there's um some months at a slower than others where you know making the making the budget would be tight tighter than ever at I'm\nNot I don't I don't I never expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly evolved going I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like ...\nBut we're expand the baby step on emergency fund what I Would do is if your income is truly evolved going I think yours is not as volatiles your acting like it is you might get a hundred grand and your whining about running out of money I mean really\nYou really need to stop and think about what you just said but anyway if you're going to go to zero in December because nobody's buying a house in Colorado Springs in December you don't want to have zero money I'll go along with that part but I don't think that's what's really happening you're making eight thousand dollars a month average\nSo I'm a five hundred to ten thousand a month whatever so anyway set some aside but we're not going to call it an emergency fund and we're not going to add to the thousand dollar account we call it an Illinois valley account the Helmand valley is the volatility of your income\nThe hill is when they had to come as good the valley is when it's bad and so if you want to set a couple of grand over there in that in addition to the thousand two separate accounts wanted for emergencies and one is for you if you run out of money because you don't make any money in a month\nBut dude I don't think you're really doing that I think you need to go back and actually look at your cash flow a analyze your revenue streams for however long you been in the business and go how many times have are really run\nOut of money I mean you can make money and so um I don't I don't think it's happening if you told me he made forty thousand dollars in real estate business I can imagine you having some zero much but you're not you know it's not what you're telling me you're making money\nA year just afraid of the volatility and you know that's reasonable so go back in track your revenues and charge revenues and if they truly are dipping down below what it takes to exist in your house\nIn giving in certain months over in a long period of time you can go back go you know every January and February I'm always rude this is where we are then okay since some money aside to cover that so that you do that but I don't think it's as bad as your emotions are telling you it is\nAnd uh but no we're not changing the emergency fun we might have a hill and valley account if you truly have a volatile into Mark's with us in Seattle hey mark welcome to the day Ramsey shop\nYeah thank Dave hey it's a great honor to talk with you I had a great impact and changed my life five years ago I'm getting like you are currently I I I got a cruel question I'm In baby steps eggs are the only thing right now I'm paying off my um do you get a net worth of a half million dollars uh [noise]\nWhat happened was this five years ago I I left a small company with a great a company culture when I hear you talk about your company that the company I was working for a very similar culture I was making an average salary or for what I did I went to a competitor I was much more\nOf your making um I was making a eighty thousand dollars a year\nWhat do you make now I make a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year on your question is what\nI make my question is is I really miss that small company culture and um I have an opportunity to go back to a smaller company of about a hundred people start up [noise] um I think it would be a really really interesting to get back into that culture um I just kind of lost my passion for my work\nAnd um you know I show up to work every day I get great reviews um\nI'd probably go back but I Want some equity or I Want some indication that I can earn my way back up to what you're actually worse in the marketplace this idea that in order to have a good work environment you have to make less\nIs not necessary is not necessarily an assumption I'm going with so maybe that particular company can't pay you but if you want you could probably find somebody with a decent ball for and how you what's your worst that's one of the mouse to this is the day Ramsey\nYou could probably find somebody with an Asian falter and how you what your worst as one miles a day this is the day Ramsey\nThat you know typically when it comes to life insurance and protecting your family that women are more likely to be on insured or under insured than men this doesn't make any sense women make up half the workforce contributes mightily to family incomes\nI don't personally have an account right now the credit union I'm not opposed to I just don't my stuff our our business accounts and our a personal accounts are all at local\nUh read our regional and I'm a community banks in our area we do business with several banks\nAnd so ... and it's very simple it's just because I Need to pick up the phone and talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller knows that kind of thing but\nAnd talk to a human being that actually has a little bit of power that can pull stuff off now I don't my CFO does but my controller does that kind of thing but but you know that's what you should want you should be able to walk in and talk to a human and not be treated like a number\nAnd you know I Do not understand why anyone would do business with people like Wells Fargo or bank of America it's beyond me\nThey treat you like crap and they overcharging for most of the services and this day in time there online offerings their Web banking systems are not any more sophisticated they're not that good\nThey're not good at anything so I just don't get it so that that's why we endorsed credit unions you hear me in some of your city is endorsing a local credit union or a local small town community type bank\nAnd I'm just a a huge fan of using that for your ah your banking service needs and it's what I did\nEverything I endorse on the show is stuff that that I personally do or what do you know in your situation and that kind of a thing I don't have anything is inconsistent like I'm too big or too good to do that I I'm not I don't have a need for some of the things that we tell ya get but\nYou know ... you know in most of these cases I'm a customer personally Ted is with us Ted's in York, Pennsylvania Hi Ted how are you\nI'm doing better than I deserve how're you doing just the same how can I help\nAll right well thank you and your staff right you're doing it's a blessing you um how it'll be needing a life saving operation about ten to Fifteen Years if I don't get hit by a bus\nAnd I want to know if I uh probably should continue funding NHL stay with my employer contributing a couple of hundred bucks a year or should I just put that extra money into a Roth IRA or four one K.\nWas it just a couple of hundred bucks a year the company I don't know whether she you can put you can hold their matching a couple of hundred bucks a year in more\nOkay so the the nature of ... what kind of life saving operation if you're going to happen to him years what is it\nI think it'll ever ooh I got huh yes see so you know fortunately is something you can't live without\nYeah I've heard that you know [laughter] oh [laughter] okay I have yet it's it's a it's a slow a slow progression then\nYeah it is they they estimate that you know Seventeen years out so okay yeah I got to figure to right around the time I'm going to retire so I'm trying to retire early you know and I'll see if I can\nYou know I think the thing is the uh what you're going to want is a ... you you you got to have the cash in your age essay or somewhere else in an investment to cover what is going to come out of your pocket I assume you're talking to health insurance is going to cover a large portion of this correct\nYeah that if I don't retire um and I'll be I'm I'm either ... or some other type of insurance policy\nYeah I think I'd be on cobra or I'd I wouldn't retire because this is a guessing this is a multi hundred thousand dollar event isn't it\nProbably yeah\nYeah and so I'm thinking we're going to turn retirement around this a little bit um or and or cobra one of the two if you want to retire early you're just going to have to pony up for the ... cover only last what two years or something\nUm I don't know you can keep that indefinitely so I I think that's number one I Want to make sure you got health insurance to cover the vast majority of those I don't want to time that poorly a but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year into that\nThere's not a one time that poor like a but then how much have you got coming out of pocket a over ten years you could put five thousand dollars a year into that ages say or whatever your big the duck double is what's your ducked double\n[noise] um [noise] more than a made up of all you know ... or ... whatever that adoptable is on the age of say a year\nOh well now a trustee of the health insurance uh I'm Out of fun I don't\nKnow the edge essays are health savings account that is attached to a health and a chess a health insurance policy that has a ... policy\nIt it depends uh depends on the policy I pick it's either six to nine nine thousand\nDollars is what I'm Talking about you can put up to that amount per year into that savings account\nThat would be six thousand yeah yeah I Wish I really found that yes and I don't touch it until I you know there\nYes here's why out when you're when you need the money out of pocket to cover the whatever comes out of pocket on on the liver surgery a and you keep your health insurance in place then you've got this big\nJuicy health savings accounts sitting there in and use mutual funds in it and let it grow over the next ten years be as big as it can there's no downside of that whatever you don't need for the liver\nTransplant or liver trans whatever the processors they're whatever you don't need you can pull out and just pay taxes on it no penalties and sixty five and so um you're going to want to build that up and you just not going to become sort of what you don't use you can use for retirement another was average sixty five\nSo I I was load that up knowing that you've got this coming down the road [noise]\n\n\nFor years and one of the most asked questions I get is day one are you going to do a live event in our

[noise]\nLike if you want to go somewhere but we're so glad you're with those those are the Dave Ramsey shop Jackie's with us in Columbia South Carolina much Jackie how are you\nDo find the thank you for taking my call sure what's up oh I Want to know if I could find a loan for my son is six years ago\nI Want to know if I signed a loan for my son is six years ago ... even though he acts and I'm sure that a part\nOf my day they said to have to look out for like ...\n... well when you go sign alone and they don't pay you get to pay it that's why they want to because on her yeah so how much do you owe and the student loan\nAll twenty thousand what's your household income or about Seventy thousand\nSeventy okay and what is your son make\nUh he just got a job about twenty dollars an hour for making about twenty to twenty five hours a week\nHe's working twenty hours a week yes okay what's she doing with the rest of his time\nReality he he he doesn't want to have\nA job that conflict with his job because he's been trying to get into this job forever because\nWhat I Would add conflict with his job he's only working ... hours a week\nRight to call 'em for this job\nTwenty hours a week or the whole week\nTwenty hours a week ... ... ... ... is a TV station and he he just go with them and they have a football game and the game the fix for it at the game\nYou know what would you be on call for football there's no emergency football\n[laughter] he's been trying to get into the TV show for years\nI got that part where he's working twenty hours a week and his mother is calling me 'cause she came by his dad gum twenty thousand dollar bill I'd like for him to work another forty hours a week on top of the twenties playing with football\nSo she can pay is freaking bills so you're not calling me how would that sound that would sound awesome\nI I Try to tell him that when I get out and get them to come through and I think and I guess not half the state like out in the hit pay dirt in the late ... at least thirty days late every\nTime you don't work much yeah yeah there's a great place to go when you're broke to work so\nUh what I Would tell him to do is get into financial piece university and get his young budding gear and start paying that I Know I I mean if I'm you I'm obey all up on this kid because he's twenty eight years old and he's a slacker\nAnd his momma is calling me you single after his mom's a single lady out here when you're fifty what\nGot a fifty fifty years old and you're having to pay this kid's bills yeah I'm mad at him right now I don't want you to be two and a good loving mama's kind of way I'm not trying to disown him I just want to knock him out on these little head okay\nYeah yeah and then you you better plan on paying it if that no mud and get moving okay right so that's you know ball and knock it out and then you just chalk it up to that and but dude I'm telling you ah we're going to have some discussions is he married\nHe lived through the girlfriend okay I'll bet she works forty hours yesterday yeah\nThere you go All right open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Katherine is with us from Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nA thank you I don't think he set out my budget I Do the every dollar\nThe Portland Maine Hi Katherine how are you\nA thank you I don't think he set out my budget I Do the every dollar budget among baby step to great I protect my expenses for the month\nProject what I'm going to be paying for debt and then sometimes something happens like last month when my car broke down and I had to have a tone and repaired and it costs almost five hundred dollars [laughter]\nI Know some had in mind off on that we know that one out of the ... do you have your your baby steps one with a thousand dollars right I Do now that would be an emergency that you would use that for\nOkay but that's what I was confused about because the way I handled it was I simply added a new line item to my budget for that item and then reduce the amount that I pay toward debt for that month so I get it wrong\nThat would be okay you cash flow did you just ... but if you can cash flow in\nThat month that's fine I didn't have to come out of the emergency plan so you are paying more than five hundred dollars extra on that each month\nYes good answer you reduced it by five hundred for one month 'cause you got kicked in the kneecap with this thing but usually you're not going to have that month in a month out now and some things if a if there's a recurring unexpected event it no longer is unexpected\nFor anti and you know you don't have anything\nBudgeted for car repairs well that would not work because most cars are going to need some repairing over a period of six months you know they're going to\nHave anything that she did for car repairs yeah\nI probably would put something in there for that because the ... your budget needs to reflect the real world and the real world is you're going to spend something on that car in a given six month period of time it might be tires that might be maintenance you might be oil change it might be a five hundred dollar toe you know\nBut you're going to spend something on a car in unless you're driving a really nice brand new cars you're going to have been something on the car during that time so your budget should reflect reality in that regards\nSo probably gonna add a little bit of a sudden it to be a lot fifty or a hundred bucks or something and let that build up as a sinking fun they call it than the every dollar software or in them on below but I don't care where you build it up but somewhere you build it up and you uh have the money in cash than\nFor your car repair as it comes up and that's an example of something that is recovering so it's no longer unexpected\nEmergencies should be unexpected things\nThings that are often enough that we can expect them aren't emergencies anymore but you did good yeah you did find just a cash flow through that emergency you slow down your debt snowball for that month and then you pick back up next month hopefully you won't have another one of those and you can really\nBuild it up and go from there so good question and you're doing good keep after Tom is with us in San Francisco Hi Tom welcome to the day Ramsey show\nDo there should be doing a great thing I've been an avid fan for three days now\nI mean can you [laughter] I'm On are elated we've been together a long time you and I [laughter]\nThe question for you so my wife and I we have about three hundred okay and and student did another hundred and Fifteen and automobile and you know line of credit that type of thing there's about four Fifteen over there\nAnd we make a pretty good income she's about one when the annual leave one eighty three hundred come on and my question for you is I was back to school to get my master's programs only twenty five okay to feel like that would be a very real\nYou know I was moved back to school and get my master the Koreans only twenty five okay so I feel like that would be a very real are away on it but over the last three days are starting to think maybe maybe I shouldn't [laughter] just want to get your take on that\nMm masters in what it would be in software engineering Mm right\nAnd it would increase your income by more than twenty five K.\n[noise] probably be hard to say um that would be when he came and raise because of the category of jump into mhm\nOkay he would make that you get back into it would make it back in touch over a year then from that point so that's really nice return I think you can put that in the budget and the reason you can put it in the budget if you make so stinking much money now you live in a very expensive area granted\nIt's crazy and can\nI ask you want to live in a really rough ... yeah but you guys are really you are really ...\nAnd ... and so I mean how quick can we pay off four hundred well we can pay off four\nHundred and two years if we do it in two hundred a year that may be living on a hundred I'm not sure you can do that after taxes in your area so you probably got a three year and get out of debt\nPlan\nBut you know vacations you don't need to see the inside of a restaurant and don't you dare taught me about buying anything else you bought enough crap for a while you need to do you need a live like people that make a hundred not people that make three hundred and get this debt on\nAnd in the process of doing that can you believe\nTwenty grand and we find in the end of the budget [noise] sure\nAnd delays you buy one month or something getting out of a sudden known occurrence [noise]\nDo your lifestyle we'd it's time to address this mess [noise]\nThis is an advantage [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nAnd that it makes your eyes light up when you talk about it you kind of smile down inside when you talk about doing this\nThing whatever the thing is okay you know once you've selected that then you decide how to study it if it's a four year degree if it's a two year vote tech degree\nOr am I going to go to a community college for two years and then go and those credits all transfer and then go to a regular school I mean for your school for two years to finish up or that kind of a thing\nCommunity college is a lot less expensive and you get your basic side of the way for the first two years for a four year degree if you want to start the second thing once you've determined what you want to do and how you're going to do it then the second thing you do is\nCollege cost is the number one cause of student loan debt mayor and what I mean is that you can buy a Bentley or you can buy a used pickup truck\nBoth our transportation but one is several hundred thousand dollars and one is just a few hundred dollars\nBut both of you know the mall and answer\nIf you if you don't have any money and you're saving up you can't afford a Bentley you can't afford to go to a super expensive college and there's nothing wrong with that by the way I didn't go to a super expensive college so you go to an end state school\nThere in Florida you go to the University of Florida Gainesville or you go to University of central Florida right there in Orlando a wonderful yeah one of the wonderful both of them in state tuition not that expensive and uh that's thing one your college selection\nAs at the least expensive college that will help you get the degree that you need to get is what you need a map with rare exceptions and you're not going out of state and you're not going super expensive private the second thing is then you start looking for scholarships and you make scholarship hunting your full time job\nOr after school job that kind of a thing and you start applying for and filling out the scholarship forms and riding the essays and you probably ask for a thousand scholarships and you'll probably get turned down for nine hundred and fifty of them but if you get fifty one thousand dollar scholarship she just went to school for\n... that'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job the third thing is planning on working a lot wow\nYou know that'd be pretty cool not a bad part time job the third thing is planning on working a lot while you are in school don't borrow money so that you don't have to work work\nAnd get good jobs jobs that pay a lot dog walking cutting grass jobs people don't want to do what they pay a lot to do well talking about minimum wage crap and if you're gonna live on campus go ahead and be an All right be a residential advisor or written that's not what they call it what is in RA\nOh it is it is a resident advisor okay so there you know the the babysitter in the dorm okay and you get free dorm for doing that and sometimes free tuition for doing that and sometimes free tuition free dorm and pay for doing that she'll be NRA if you're going to live on campus\nOr work in the cafeteria get free food do you live on campus if you can get a job working for the university the tuition might be completely free\nNow that might be different to something to look at it so that's the kind of stuff you look at but figure out where you're going what steps are to get their figure out the cheapest way to get their cigarette scholarships or somebody pays you to get there and then plant on working your butt off\nAnd those things will get you through school completely debt free in this day and time and it can be done Alex is with us in Baltimore hey Alex welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nAnd Mr Ramsey how are you a thank you for everything that you do thank you\nI just want to give me a call and let you know that one I Am debt free I'm On baby step three um I got five months saved up two months ago are my six months but here's my question and I work full time in a retail establishment and I have a small\nA job that I run myself on the side\nI'm at that point in the retail establishment where I think it's time for me to say adios and we'll start my\nFocused towards my mom personal business ... want to know should I you can't ship would you like by the use my emergency fund to help me through that I was growing pains of being full time with my small side job\nNo it's not an emergency um\nYou're creating an emergency by leaving the job too soon I don't blame you from one to leave and we wanted to do your own thing I Want you to do that too but once you get how you get your side business making more money you're going to work anymore\nAnd you may have to just take fewer hours at the a retail thing and back your hours down that may mean you move to a different retail job I don't know but today you're not making enough money on the side job or you wouldn't have asked that question\nWell that's true much money you make it on the side\nA neat nearly um probably pulling out about twenty\nOr is your best month over a thousand four thousand one was a a pie about seven months\nAgo and you do that again I doubt I Wish\nYou know you gotta gotta get there now what

K. U. T. [noise]\nA global make America you're joining the conversation here on the day Randy show on can Coleman joined in Studio by Christie right we're Ramsey personalities were there'll be this hour\nWith your business or your career that's what we're taking this hour come on come on Tripoli eight to five five two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five and we're going to go to Patricia who's on the line in Tampa, Florida how can we will\nDo thank you for taking my call sure absolutely so\nYou haven't read that book and you know London um I'd love to open a yoga studio that function without wellness center ourselves off or not this little God the financial coaching and other things to cook or physical mental and emotional health\nBut I think about selling my house buying that he'll play where I live up there and it will be the wellness center like concern that that is that um oh there'd be some sort of liability\nWell or go ahead you\nKnow like if someone was to get hurt a lot I Know that can apply for the and they go out there if I were to say they will go after the fitness but if I Lived in the same building with that there but I don't know I'm Wondering if that would be\nSo you're you're going to have liability if someone gets hurt and you need to know what those are and to protect yourself with insurance um professional insurance products based insurance if you had a product that type of things you want to look into that\nBut I Do just want to challenge you and one thing for ... I Love your idea I Love the idea of a wellness center I Love the idea that you're helping people but here that are traditionally encourage people to do because you don't currently have a yoga studio and you don't have the idea of validated\nI Want to challenge you to start a little bit smaller in a little sooner so I'll give you an example\nWhere is there a wellness center community center yoga studio ... studio somewhere where you could start your business sublease third base and they're off hours builds your brand build the demand you have no risk no overhead no upfront costs\nAnd you're able to validate your idea until the business justify you getting your own space be that a duplex that you live about or your own stand alone space I'll give an example there are a lot of churches\nThat will operate when they're getting started out of like elementary school the elementary school right next door household they don't have to go on Sundays so they rented out to a church that use it on Sunday\nAnd if this great deal to win when it's additional revenue for the school the church has a place to go without having to afford a whole building seven days a week when they can't justify it\nAnd I've seen a lot of businesses do that so I don't think your idea is a bad idea I Would just challenge you to start smaller in sooner on a lower risk level lower cost level and validate your idea and build those relationships build your brand in your demand\nGet that going and then when you're ready to have your own studio it's the next logical step it doesn't feel like a terrifyingly so you never want to look into laws and regulations for liability but also when you think about your space before you make that big commitment\n[noise] Patricia are you a lot of phone are you working full time right now\nRight and that was the question I work full time and I ran and I was planning and also going back well mine that had to share that way I'm making more money but it'll help them find like business as well\nYeah I Will agree so you can I just wanted to know that fact because this this that piece of information please beautifully knew what you're saying\nShe's going to have to do this on the side anyway she's not in a position to open up anything I don't think you would try to go right on open it right um I I just want to see you maybe do a little bit of yoga for some people maybe two or three months when I see if you can get a small group to pay you\nBecause everything you just said but it allows you to tip toe into it or the nurse practitioner thing that's going to school to get that will make more money I Love that too is going to lower the cash flow of more cash piled on when it's time to to operate so I mean you you nailed it there I I just think ... you know don't rush into the\nWell and the other thing I Want to call out for anyone listening right now that has a service based business or like a yoga studio you have a tendency to think that the studio is the business it's not if you are and what you can go anywhere you can go to people's houses you can go to the parked outside\nThey're coming and paying for you so don't feel like you have to have a location\nBefore you can start your business because you are the business so you can start tomorrow Patrice ... out of your living room if you want to or the ... down the street and by the way you should go hit totally yeah yeah don't wait for the studio studio is not the business you are the business point people don't care I Know the real news they enjoy it they're coming for use or not counting for the building\nTriple eight eight to five five two to five triple eight to five five two to five ... sitting in for they ran through this hour taking your calls about your business your business idea or a career career change career question let's go to bill who's on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can\nWe help\nA career\nCareer change career question let's go to bill is on the line and Detroit Michigan bill how can we\nHead of the crust on her to get a few good things are common how can we do well\nI've been on the chief field for about Twenty years and to the point that really hasn't been I haven't progress as far like where am I originally hoped and wished I had\nA long story short is I'm back in January was that I went through F P view and as would have gone through a baby steps one based up to right now\nGoing through some of our stuff planning to get a grabs they'll go on a we came in to some old home movie ... some stuff that she had gotten from bad um when he had died um and\nThrough all the things we found you know we have a lot of old eight millimeters old VHS of stuff and it's like okay we have all this stuff\nUm I started to averting it and I really found a passion for that that I haven't had in a few for quite a while and I'm thinking okay this sounds like something I could turn that triggered business a month doing going forward\nI'm struck at this point bill and\nBill let me interrupt what is the bit to get right to what is the business with the middle of me or what is the business\nI'm converting legacy formats like eight millimeter VHS wide film law that uh could digital content and properly preserve them\nOkay and so what's your question for us then\nUm we\nBought a question I have is just um how to get started um I definitely want to get started and I just want to make sure I'm stepping through its a properly and and the um\nMore tell you what Bill question\nBill ... he's ready to go she can cause we only have a little bit of time here I Want to be able to get to your your solution\nWe want to make sure we might help yeah here's the thing about the great news dance or when you were entering a space where there's already people doing what you want to do it means the ideas prevent\nSo you're not doing something that's never been done before there are actually businesses that have similar type services what you didn't know is yes you're solving a problem and if you're solving a problem it's a viable business idea\nYou just have to find people that have that problem that had the eight millimeters they want to preserve on and you're going to learn how who that person is you're going to go after them and build a business for them so you're going to price for them you're going to create marketing language that speaks to them right where they are the the best part about this bill it you know the idea is valid because it's been done before what you're going to do\nIs you're going to build your business and you're going to get better and you're going to serve your customers and they're gonna want to come to you because you make a unique space for yourself\nIn that market a bill I Know my book is for women but I'm going to send it to you men read it all the time to business principles are the same and it gives you plan to take that idea to market I Hope it helps and we'll get we'll send that to you since ...\nIt's a great plans to follow it and and here's the thing of course there's a lot of bills out there he said something that's interesting\nHe finds these old things and you realize way you don't have to have this ... and you are giving him the steps the book is going to walk into it but I wanted you said when they try it just tested on this and all of that last caller here's why some passion should\nBe ... it changes things when you turn it into a business is\nWhat you made a great point other people are doing this he just got to find people that are willing to pay him to do it and keep paying him until others have you need this done me tell you about bill he's got to start really small but start right away some thinking about it stopped getting Lanny just do not want to just do it\nStop it just you know in the water just do a triple eight eight to five five and two to five coming up more of your questions about career starting a business [noise] don't go anyway this is\nYou've heard me talk about our deep there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity the last year yes sixteen million\nGoing to say one quick thing let you go here's the deal hang on until the hubby gets back to ... you know what I mean you gotta hang on and you can do it here we are in October first years coming right now you have to do it so I think that motivation just hang in there and in Christ is going to we're we'll talk about the plant\nAnd do it here we are in October first years coming right now you have to do it so I think that motivation just hang in there and Christ is going to were well known about the plan to get their\nQuick quick question Katie that contract jobs you're doing in addition to the fulltime salary job or those something you're running independently already or do they go through the main company was paying your salary\nSo they're different companies OK I'm here yeah two of them are kind of actually my own project I work on out here in Minnesota the other one is the company I used to work for ... years ago that you\nContract court for perfect I mean they don't have that salary yeah\nThe the reason I'm asking is because when you go out on your own even if it's just getting that first client or two that can be the scariest part to validate can I Do it on my own and can I make the sale and can run this whole thing\nWithout having a boss that kinda backs me and you're already doing it and that's why I'm so excited in Haiti because you're just going to do more of what you're already doing a little bit and just like Ken that\nYou've got this light at the end of the tunnel when you're going to start to increase your family household income in other ways through your husband\nBut in the meantime if you want to spend the next two to three months building up the demand the client the relationship even just taking people to coffee starting to gather interest of other independent projects you could run on your own that could run through this new architecture firm that you're going to run as an independent person\nYou're building it up and of course it will be crazy for a season because you're getting more and more demand but then\nWhen you decide to leave your fulltime job it the next logical step where the business can support you the income is there of course that's only going to help and your husband had income\nSo you're all ready I Would say twenty to thirty percent down the path of doing this you're not starting from scratch or not like I have full time job and I want to do this totally different thing how do I started out\nYou're already doing it you already have clients are working with I just want you to do more of that and then the next few months as you build that up that will start to ramp up as her husband's income comes in and it looks like first of the year you probably should be able to comfortably leisure Labor Day job\nYeah and it comes down to a form of the you gotta work days maybe step stays baby steps from the dream so when you put enough money aside plus decide businesses there and then that's how you get to that number where you can step aside into Christie's point does not have to be a ... jump right it should be a nice move and it just takes a little bit of time and patience delays on her way the light at\nThe end of the tunnels an important point can cause so many people feel like how can I sustain this well you're not until January when you ... you know this is the first season him to put my head down for a season them and had the rewards it's worth it things are\nAll right let's go to ray real quick in Orlando, Florida re how can we help\n[noise] hey how you doing guys um okay so I've been in the field for the past Eighteen
