I'm In the end of this week\n[noise] All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... number for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically [noise] um\nThe people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent live or portfolio or universal or anything where there is an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nRap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing\nWhen you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return regardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees which usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out in these even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in a good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die\nWith cash value permanent portfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone\nSo you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all this is a bad savings account it's bad investment broker\nAnd I keep all your money after that they give you a better rate of return and when you die they keep it all\nThis is a bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey has always had for twenty five years here on the air upset it\nFor twenty five years is all I have owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind\nEver not did get a horrible northwestern mutual\nWhole life grotesque old school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Britain they it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than\nFifteen to twenty year\nTerm life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker that shop several companies the best way to buy insurance if any connoisseur a broker the chops several companies and get you the best possible deal\nWhether it's your car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've indoors for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Zander and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that's the other a lot is always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the day Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he said he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple it takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance has been cost that much so just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yet again yes\nYou need life insurance oh by the way a broker you know you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with good with the help they usually indoors local providers for your ... what we call PNC property in casual you got your\nAnd your homeowner's insurance you can shop most people saved three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies instead of using what we call a captive agents in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for a major [noise]\nSomebody instead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive agent can sell for one company like a state for major foreign nationwide in Asia or Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas it nationwide that's nationwide in it you know but um and they're both good guys I like both of them it's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys\nWhen you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys were cheap I'll just tell you this is the day
