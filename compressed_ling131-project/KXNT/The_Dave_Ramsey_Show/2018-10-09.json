house\nWe want to take her two young children to Disney World you should\nWe're currently saving to build her on a new home on property we bought in cash already we can cash flow the trip by not saving for the house for one month about three thousand dollars I feel guilty for both not taking a family vacation and for not saving money where's the balance you you're guilty a lot on what you\nMean you're stuck because you're just going to be guilty you're guilty if you go to Disney and you're going to be guilty if you don't\nYou know what I Do I'll be happy about it either one going to be guilty either way it's your money it's your choice you're smart either way you're out of debt you have your emergency fund and you're saving up for expenditures\nOne of the expenditures as you want to build a house for cash has some awesome go second one is you want to spend one month to that money and go to Disney about three thousand bucks a either one is wonderful you should not feel

do\nJust not something I Want to do but you it's fine I mean Rachel cruise loves Disney she just took her little baby down there they had a wonderful time not sure how ready time her husband had but they had a great time and I'm now a but but I mean if it's what you want to do\nYou've saved up the money you're not going into that you're not getting out of debt and going on vacation you're out of that\nYou have your emergency fund this is the point in the baby steps where you enjoy some of the money and I don't suggest consuming all of it and hitting no long term goals but I think if you don't consume some of it and only hit long term goals then you're not enjoying your life\nYou live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else during the first three baby steps you're extremely intense you don't do anything except beans and rice rice and beans till you're ... out of debt and have your emergency fund in place and then you let your foot off the accelerator

all it's good for Jay is with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Jay welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\n... or ... thank you for taking my call first time caller sure I'm about two years ago I began a commercial helicopter training\nAnd I finally received like Marshall helicopters their ticket um however I unfortunately I Need a ... pie eighty hours or more training I've had discovered a the history is highly regulated by and sharing and an orderly kind of like sure why NATO out two hundred hours and um\nTo a figure 'em out how to pay for those eighty hours and be ready to work the upcoming season I'm as a commercial up about\nThat is there any way you can do it as a co pilot and yet the hours\nNo unfortunately uh they are the jobs are there any ... is the single pilot\nNow that that moment you just said the wrong thing you should do the job opportunity there's only one person in Florida and you know ... what's wrong\nWell I I didn't tell you another thing or two days I I work at a firefighter so that's my primary um income choice there's this kind of like a secondary thing that I kinda went off in bed and that's um\nThat's kinda why I'm I'm kinda limited as far as the ... the jobs that I I can take\nThe helicopter pilots not make more than ...\nI Know I Believe it or not firefighters are definitely make life\nOkay so you're not planning on quitting the firefighting degree or career you're going to continue that and part time helicopter pilot\nYes yes that's that's what I Want to do [noise] okay um\nAnd you show U.S forces you to stay in that particular area and it forces you to work an irregular schedule that you can control and so it does limit the number of jobs available which means that having your helicopter pilots life things has a very limited value\nYeah it's not that I think it's not that valuable to you because of the way you're going to utilize it so I mean you have to just cash flow this is like a like a hobby you're getting paid for your own make some money but if you're not going to make enough money to even justify the expense you've gone too\nYeah so I just I feel I'm I'm too far into it to just\nWell I'm not suggesting you quit but there's just no way in the scenario you've laid out here that it makes sense to do anything except to slow down and go I'm just gonna take me a little time does I got a cash flow this and I got to find the time to do the hours\nRight they say don't rush to get the job\nDone me up and they don't charge not worth that much\nYeah it doesn't pay that much either\nThat's what I mean they're not worth that last compared to what you're saying you're not even gonna make back you're eighty hours worth of training and the first year\nNo no you're right yeah\nSo not to mention all the money you've already put on it so um what I Want to do is look for a place I mean you've got connections in the fire department other lifelike guys or something that you can get some hours in the co pilot seat and get some takeoffs and landings and get a counselor actually\nA fork saying those are more complex aircraft and I'm I'm currently find a lot of them that we're at\n... and both have aircraft gotcha not even\nTurbine yet but um I mean I've even reached out to people on there on an aircraft and and you know offered to pay for fuel and things like that to kinda do get those are ... and unfortunately a lot a lot of those guys are very busy\nThough yeah I can get into our air and our there but nothing really calm and\nTo do you're going to end up paying for these our borders to eighty hours calls\nWell considering some of the hour and a waste of a you know on the cheap you can get some at two fifty a three hundred five hundred it all depends on the aircraft and what kind of a deal you can get you know so\nShe just won a thirty thousand bucks yeah pretty much know pretty much yeah and you don't have that laying around obviously negative negative on\nTake your time and cash flow it because you you now have as we continue the conversation you've even narrowed your opportunities down further because you're in an entry level um the simpler versions of helicopters\nByrd jobs you can take even more and so this is slightly above a hobby\nYeah yeah ... ... yeah why not I I there's nothing wrong with that as long as you pay cash for it yeah yeah I mean I I've got a ... I collect handguns and shoot them a lot and ah and and also I\nBurn through some MOH a but it's a ... I don't make any money doing them I Try and make money doing it but I was just a hobby and so that costs money hobbies costs are on and this was not going to cost you money it's actually gonna make you a little once you get past this but\nUp until the point you actually get a check it's going to cost you money and you know you're just going to put another twenty thousand bucks into this thirty thousand bucks out of this before you get paid\nAnd um that may take you two years the cash flow that instead of one you're not going to make this year unless you can find some way that the guys that are hiring for the season want to pay for it in return you promised to work there are three years or something\nLike that you know and they want to pay for your hours or something maybe there's somebody looking for a power that you know without much intensity or sometimes are unemployed here or will pick up some education costs in order to get somebody on board if they're having trouble finding the help in that area\nAlso helps interesting destruction [noise]\nThis is that Iran [noise]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and

then drove a little better ... you move up but right now we're going to pay cash and instead of putting five hundred dollars towards the prosperity Ford Motor credit and\nPut it towards your prosperity and if you put five hundred and six dollars five hundred dollars you put a mutual fund in your Roth IRAs got a good track record from age thirty eight Seventy you'll have between five and six million dollars\nIn that account touchdown hope Iraq the car\nIf I mean our car regime out of your dollar power and our car payment that's what you're driving\nAnd when we look I'm Still in the

government which has no so and so I I Would get them paid as fast as possible because I wouldn't want them out of my life\nAnd so for that reason I'm going to you know that's going to be the tie breaker twenty eight hundred versus twenty eight hundred on the debt snowball for me and uh I'd knock them out right quick now when you get to the four oh one K. you know you cannot pay extra on it\nHey David Koch ... what's up\nMy quick who was about um\nYour credit score so I've only had one alone I'm In my life I'm going through right now or her small out alone when I got my car mhm I'm ... I'm completely that free right now mhm but I I decided to hop on a credit karma a little bit ago about\n\nGuys you guys know\nRamsey show we are huge fans of people who've had to leave the cave heal suffering under I get home turn into millionaires the original book started everybody talking about those back in the early Nineteen nineties\nWhen I wrote my first book when financial piece came out it was a book called the millionaire next door but Dr Tom Stanley it changed the way everyone thought about millionaires I got to know\n... a little bit a while he was living and I've gotten to know his daughter since then and I'm big fans of each of theirs and we're big fans of course of anyone who's in this millionaire space doing anything\nAnd as you guys know Chris Hogan has a million or a book coming out in January but Sarah for law is with us a Tom Standage daughter and or is this the first time we've ever talked on the airwaves topped off the air and she has a new book coming out of the in ... along with some of her\nWell I'm honored the new book is called the next millionaire next door in during strategies for building wealth and it it's out this week right\nThat's right yeah it's um it was a labor of love and it without my father but you know it out and live really excited about it\nYou know if you didn't know her her dad passed in a car wreck what four years ago it was yeah it was it two thousand Fifteen that's right yeah he said yeah I'm thinking I remembered that about there and um\nWe had to have him on several times over the years as we discuss this whole subject to millionaires and\nSo although some of the mythology that as a room millionaires so uh you use some of the research firm in Europe are professional researcher to like he was and uh and they put this together tell me about the ... part of it what does this or did you do and more of it which combined with what he had done\nYeah that's it that's the trade so we weren't together really on the initial survey for the book um you know really started back in two thousand twelve thinking about the twentieth anniversary of the millionaire next door like that it came out in the nineties\nAnd and work together on kind of what the book should include and got to the point when we were just about to send out a survey I'm shu our sample of of African Americans and he was killed by by a drunk driver\nUm and so really he wasn't able to see the data that came back and compare it to what was there in Nineteen Ninety six and Andy On 'em so that's kind of where I took up a sick on the project and and kept going with it\nSure is an industrial psychologist and president of data points without a research and\nTechnology company that studies wealth accumulation and builds tools to help and you guys have to check this out its um data points dot com has all the stuff on her research as well which you can get the new book the next millionaire next door\nIn during strategies for building wealth at any major bookstore show the moved out of it you guys got\nAs you put this back together on the anniversary and then you've added to it since was your continued research\nWhat were the ... was there anything that just shocked to win the findings where you should wild and see that one coming\nOut you know we worked a lot at um some of the mistakes or that kind of behaviors that millionaire make related to investing and I think what was causing was\nYou know just like any of us that are trying to do the right thing um millionaires make mistakes along the way to an hour with a lot of that sort of behavior and the the mistake if you will that they make related to him but I think that that was surprising and then I think what was surprising to is that why hasn't things in terms of the kinds of\nOr that the amount that they're spending on things like a furniture and clothing and things like that that some of those things are surprising that were sort of similar time\nYeah I was speaking in a church a couple of days ago and I told them one of the\nA key points that I've seen over twenty five years of doing this on the side of things you have to do if you want to build wealth is you have to be careful who you hang around with because you become who you are running around with and she on the back of your book understanding how those around you influence your financial buddy ... what'd you find on that\nAbsolutely I think that again you see it very clear from the work that we've done both with populations in and out every every day folks like I like\nThat they are um that that that social and different that not caring about what others they driving and buying and wearing is a really key factor and building well no it's related to network regardless of how old you are how much you make\n'em and I think you know now with technology it really\nOr why what other people are doing research for media and so forth but it continues to be there are just not hearing about what other people is unreal that it is one of the wave itself well\nYou know I think in my case I was I was a unique because one of the benefits going broke what I'd do it in my twenties where his violently was ... at that point I just reached all I wanted to do survive\nAnd thrive and and I reached a point I just don't care what people think I still don't care what people think and I think there was a big contributor\nTo me uh personally you'll be able to to build wealth again after going bankrupt but I see it with other people is when you don't care what other people think about what you drive where you live what closure where whether you've been on vacation you're not trying to keep up with other people's Facebook version of themselves then you've got the ability to win\nAbsolutely and I think like he said I think that that on Facebook there isn't a lot is a lot different right then what's really going on and I live here so that's something to keep in mind but we definitely see that and the research\nShe'll gaining knowledge and composer to invest in grow will that is a great word come closer to grow ... what do you mean by that\n[noise] but you know little study that related to making it and when it comes to mind that meant that it really you know you could apply to any kind of major financial decision that you're making matter to the kind of comedy as hell before making this decision so I Know the example we get sometimes there's\nA desk and it rained not a great time to go out and look for in a car because you're not if you're in an emotional state where you are so excited about the new income level that you have all of a sudden your decision making is a little off so he can stay home and come as\nA matter what the financial decision bar then you'd have a better chance making the right one\nAnd I often hear ah we've got a ... personalities as a career show on you know choosing a career and there's all this stuff about following your passion out there but you guys have you found yet again in this new set of data\nThe idea that ate a lifestyle related freedom does not equate to less income or less wealthy it actually ... the new\n[noise] yeah you know I think that's right I think that you know understanding that looking at your passion\nOr your your interests let's say for your career has me grounded and I'm kind of reality and and and I think that that's something that\nYou know a lot of people don't want to hear but it is true and so um if you had a passion for the arts and that's really where you want your career to go um you know you have to take that with the reality that that means that certain things are going to have to be set aside\nFor that kind of again it's a ... a lot of I don't want to hear but um we often have been here since ... you\nKnow there's a price to be paid to build wealth and it's worth the price and nobody does it accidently they'll do it with a plan\nI absolutely yeah that that's one of the things that we keep thing over and over again and again we're talking about millionaires or those that are on their way to becoming a millionaire but\nThat time spent planning and and looking at your goals and monitoring what's going on in your financial life and not you know keeping your head and than um that that relates to building off every time the that statistically and of course they do it while\nWe're talking with Dr service Stanley follow all of 'em I'm I'm ... and lost my mother will say it correctly\nIt full la la la la la la la yeah it's\nGot they told me that one on there and ... and a daughter of Dr Tom Stanley a comic were called the millionaire next door a lot of you've read it if you hadn't you should and you need to read some of his new book that she did combined with her dad's ...\nYeah there when he passed away the new book is called the next millionaire next door it is now out\nAnd you need to read it now you know we've got a book out called a Chris Rock and called everyday millionaire and let me tell you if you want to be a millionaire there's not one book you read all of them and you learn from every one of them\nThere's no competition that's where we answer on we've been friends with them for years we'd love that she's got a book out come in the same year that we do and we want love helping her we want you to go by this book right now it's called the next millionaire\nNext door Sarah thank you for being with us today\nThey got me this is the day Ramsey shot [noise]\n\n\nYou've heard me talk about ideas there for years and how it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity the last year yes sixteen million\nAnd she ... she will see that on open box and she will give me a lot of crap because she knows and I can't have that we are good sister rules are exactly so I'm like before she gets here I'm signing up for a class and that was the motivating factor finally got it so\nIt's her fault for minimum wage\nTo do her debt free scream you get shamed in the process that causes you to be here to do your debt free sharing fact\nI'll take it\nThat work such good family stuff right there and I should\nSay it ends up being a pretty good book into because I went out of them got out of debt and this last April and um the singles at my church decided to go on this big trip to Montana and I am I the same vehicle that I got replaced um you know the engine replaced\nIsn't SUB so I'm like I'll get I'll take everybody you know I can put a bunch of stuff in their own I thought I Would uh on I'll take it in for a ... you see where this kind of take it in for just a quick all change and turn up before I go and they say oh you're about to blow a tie rod and some other things that's about a thousand bucks and it's not okay thanks\nAnd so I just do that and then I go on to the Montana trip come back and\nCame back in ... and ah my Lehman was out so all of the tires were were just shredded and there are other things wrong so in a five week period I had twenty three hundred dollars with hardy pairs plus a vacation\nAnd I was able to cash flow the whole thing but good in our in our broken you're going to pay for it is actually ... that's the that's a good time when you do not have liquid cars [laughter] well ... what do you tell people the key to getting out of that is\nYou you really you have to make sure you have to want to do it you know you have to\nYou know you can't just and actually you can't just sort of want to you it has to be the motivating passion for a while 'cause I was like the only thing I could think about for gamers I've got to get out of ... all one wins by accident yeah yeah and so um\nIt was obvious you're you're ... was a big cheerleader ... who who were the other cheerleaders\nMet my parents are

I'm a\nI'm an comes up like a reasonable comfortable amount and\nHonestly I think number yes I have a little bit you know it was a big now that it's a lot better than you're paying now but if that's a that's\nOf your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency fund and blows\nNo it was a big number it's a lot better than when you're paying now but if that's a ...\nA fourth of your take home pay or less and your debt free with your emergency fund and blows you have the math spread to prosper if you continue to budget and stay on track but again that's not what you should do that's the most you should do\nSo you can do less if you want to 'em or you could put it on a shorter term if you want to\n... and you know I'm about less house at Twenty one hundred and paid off in ten years there's nothing wrong with blood on five years I don't care I mean you can do a lot of stuff but the most I Would ever tell you to do and I I don't even do that 'cause I don't borrow money at all for anything ever\nIs a Fifteen year fixed rate\nWhere the payment is no more than a fourth of your take home pay Luke is whether it's in Dallas Hi Luke welcome to the Dave Ramsey Shia\nHi Dave area better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo um my wife and I have a ... for many years actually my dad got me actually when I was a young kid and I'm like stupidly I did not take care bye And I have student loans and um [noise] we are considering taking a cash out refinanced our house\nTo knock out the high ... and ... are paying the debt off on the house because it that much lower interest rate [noise]\nAnd how much did want to share my student loan debt that you have 'em read at forty eight thousand trying and what's your household income\nFluctuates between Paco forty to sixty so I own my own business so last year we did sixty five this year we're looking at probably go I'm probably going to bring home the culture to forty two\nOkay I I don't know what you've been listening to on the show but in the uh twenty six years I've never told someone to do a refinance actually take care to pay off their debt ever except to avoid bankruptcy or foreclosure and you're facing neither\n... and so on now I I've never told anybody to do that okay and the reason is very simple you make enough money to pay this debt off in a couple of years calm you're going to work like a maniac and you're gonna have to have no life\nBut then you're going to be dead free except your house and then you can work on paying off your house I'm from there and of course start working on your retirement and the other baby steps that we won't be rude but you can't borrow your way out of debt\nAnd on and if you pay this off within two years the interest rate on this becomes mathematically irrelevant\nBecause you're not so fast it's not like you're keeping it for Thirty years it's a two year thing and and really is not forty eight thousand for two years more like twenty thousand for two years because halfway through you're going to be halfway through\nAnd and so yeah you guys need to get on a budget really really tight budget very careful very dialed in\nTouch your lifestyle to nothing do everything you can all your business to increase your income because you need to clean up the student loan debt I agree with you on that part but no I don't I don't tell people to borrow to get out of debt you can't borrow your way out of debt and then work you can dig your way out of a whole\nDigging out of a whole is a an oxymoron excitement that we all make which I'm digging out of a whole you're not digging out I Hope you dig out the bottom of a hole gets deeper you can't dig out of all you have to fill in the hall I get to climb out of a whole maybe but you don't dig out of a home\nUnless you dig into China you know more so now you can't you can't you can't borrow your way out of that and that's the same exact situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nLittle on the sand and say well now borrowing money\nYeah and that's the same situation so you got to stop that you have to break that cycle\nLittle on the sand and say well now borrowing money ever ever ever ever ... [noise]\n\nI get a law calls for ... not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out it because you were duped you can't\nBut she nerd who needed a strategy goes to the clash and what did you come out with Romney where you were how what light bulb moment that you have a ha moment where you ... oh\nYou know David it's amazing when you go to this class you it's a big support group that I think everybody really needs to be a part of ...\nBecause we we lived in a very high end area and it was just amazing how much did everybody had\nAnd were like wow like you know this is a support group and you know this is a great way would start with the baby steps mhm and we did that we had a bunch of savings saved up and we used a lot of that just kick starter bizarro intensity and it really helps how much\nAre we had about ten thousand okay and so\nThat was hard for a nerd it was it was a check it out and doing all those sort of ... ... takes your breath away so Veronica ... goes to a class you go to class but then you get in there and there has to be a moment where you go oh sure I like this\nIt wasn't so much that I didn't like it I just I felt like I needed like I said strategies to help me 'cause I I didn't want to be in that either and then I just felt like there is just a huge cloud over as all the time and what was your\nBiggest takeaway ban where you went oh I see that now\nEverything about it was awesome honestly and I think it was realizing our roles and and with him being dinner that he is and then me just coming to my senses and saying you know is this\nIs this material things something that I really need to have and using the ... system really helped me and I'm not felt\nOur budget and ... you know this is the amount of money we need to pay for our groceries and says you know this is how much we we can get to the church and this is how much we can give people for gifts and what not and so I just needed to lay out and once we implemented those steps I you know we're just\nLets you sound a little bit like ritual Richard ... is that a budget as permission to spend\nI Love your daughter permission to spray on the yeah\nYeah and that's exactly what it is I there is sometimes when I just felt like we didn't have any money that's the mindset I had to give myself was okay we don't have money for this but you know it's there and we wanted it but in you know and I'm going down for a budget\nBut once I set about whether control me at All right you know very very good okay so we know uncle was a cheerleader window your brother was a true leader and you had the community that you've got plugged into were true leaders who else would your biggest cheerleader I think\nI'm a I mean we're really close to our family and my family through all of them are very supportive of us we we both come from five brothers are not five ... five kids from each family so two brothers and sisters so we have we come from a big family but um\nThey were all supportive of us\nReally in our friends and as well so ...\nAre cool so what do you tell people to key to getting out of that is now that you've done it\nI think the key thing David is being on the same page ... you know communication is key and you\nKnow we went to the money and marriage last week and we were listen to a lot of the other couples mhm and none of them have gone through the financial peace where they've gone through a lot of seminars mhm and I think if they had gone through the seminar or the financial peace university they would really get on the same page\nAnd it would just really explode once I get through that and and follow the ... the steps yeah\nAnd just you know writing down our goals was really important for us to do and once we had that you know are very goal driven um especially being in sales you got to be one thing\nReally important for us to do and once we had that you know we were married goal driven and especially being in sales yeah you got to be ... you know we have that target and we wanted to hit it and said just staying focused and dedicated and discipline and really really helped us and\nWell done you guys from Bert proud of you very well done your shrunk couple a lesson right joy that marriage money thing or it's but virtually stand up comedy goes there both a book about a ... yeah they really are funny and
