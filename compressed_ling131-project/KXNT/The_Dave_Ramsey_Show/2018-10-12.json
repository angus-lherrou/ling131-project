[noise] [noise] Mm\nThanks for being with us from out of this is the Dave Ramsey show so glad you're here Mm you know it's interesting um and informative to all of us to stop and think about some\nHope\nCauses you to be able to move the needle causes you to be able to move forward when you think the light at the end of the ... at the end of this one was an oncoming train your paralyzed your stop your overwhelm your frozen you get paralysis or the analysis that hopelessness when you think that the light and the tunnel is the way\n... right and and what's the difference in those two events both light both a tunnel both of situation one is you believe that if you run to the lot you're going to get out one of you believe you run to the light you're going to get killed right I mean so that's hope and hopelessness\nAnd all of a ... me included face that or have faced that at times in our lives\nAnd it's amazing to me the power of our brain and our spirit that God gives us to do things that are way beyond what we thought we could do once we believe that they are possible\nThat's called hope\nAnd so when I show you look you know you make a hundred thousand dollars a year\nGot thirty thousand dollars in debt you feel stock but gosh if we did that at a thousand dollars a month you're going to be out of debt and my gosh and a thousand dollars a month out of a hundred thousand is nothing I swam thousand dollars a year you're going to be out of debt and a little over two years\nAnd you suddenly go oh I see it ... it's the same situation you were in but now you can see it\nYou see what I'm Talking about and once you can see it that's called hope I can see my way out one of the things that steals your hope is when you have lost your perspective perspective is of course your point of view the way you're seeing things\nIt's happened to me it's happened to you\nI remember one time one of my daughters when she was in high school certain boy did not call it a certain time that he was supposed to call and she was very upset like\nThe world is coming to an ...\nAnd her mom and I are trying to quit laughing so we can walk in and comfort\nHer [laughter]\nNow wire waste and they in the hall outside her bedroom laughing and why is she in their\nHopeless\nWell we've got perspective we see things that she doesn't see because we've been places she hasn't been on and have experiences that she doesn't have right\nSo we've been to our twenty year class reunion we know she'll be glad he didn't call [laughter] that's what we're giggling about standing and All right so we have perspective\nAnd so we you know when you don't have ... when you cannot see the other side you're standing in poop up to your knees but you can't see the other side of it\nThen you know it's not fertilizer at that point it's just poop but when you can see the other side of it then it's fertilizer and it it's going to grow some things in your future\nYou know when you're walking through garbage in other words you're going to you ... there's some good is going to come out of the garbage that you're in but but when it gets right down on you and your vision is just the end of your nose and not the end of your life\nWhen you look out ten years you see stuff different than when you look out ten seconds\nThe young man I was just talking to an end folks that have dealt with an homeless situation says one of the problem is the the desperation just to eat and not be cold\nCauses you to have ten second increments of thought instead of ten year increments of thought gee I can stand back from that sitting here warm and with a full belly in my studio several thousand miles away and look at him and go to just go work more\nBut he can't see he couldn't see that you don't care that you wouldn't get like go go go deliver pizzas go blow leaves go walk dogs go shovel something somewhere you know go do something do you know work all the time because as soon as you do that\nFrom work is where it comes from I Can't get an of ours will than work someplace else work more work all the time but but because I've done that kind of stuff and I'm the other side of it and I've seen what it does mean out when we were going broke I too little babies and wives houses in foreclosure were that close to homeless ourselves\nSo how we get out of it worked her mind off and well you know you you\nCan't work your way out everything that I didn't work my way out I went bankrupt but I didn't lose the house and if I had lost the house on a pound someplace living out of work my way into their own apartment and we lived in that well you know ... and it's not that I'm Better is not that I'm smarter only thing is just perspective\nIs like I didn't grow up rich but I had a friend that grew up rich and\nBecause he grew up in a wealthy home he had the perception that everything was going to work out because it it always worked out and I had the perspective that angle or guy [laughter]\nThis is going to be awful and but because he thought everything was always going to work out you know it all worked out a lot because I\nDidn't think it was going to work out sometimes it didn't work out you say you set yourself in these traction these rockets with this thing but when you can see the other side of it it's easy to work through it\nIt's when you can't see the other side of it that you don't want to work through it 'cause you don't believe it's going to work that's called hopelessness the situation is exactly the same they only different issue is your perspective\nAnd some challenges that might be right now that I think you're stuck you think you're stuck in a career you think you're stuck in this\nMarriage it's bad it's always going to be that way you think you're stuck with whatever behavior you're stuck with you think you're stuck with your money you think you're stuck in that you're not stuck\nYou're not stuck life is not a snapshot it's a film strip you're going to turn the page and something else is going to happen better or worse tomorrow it is not going to stay the same you are not stuck\nSo look the other side of it look out there five years look out there three years look out their ten months and say what am I got to do what's got to be true that's not true right now for me to never be here again that's a question he was asking but he was having trouble emotionally buying it\nAnd I don't think I helped him a it's kind of bothered me that's why I Want to talk about a minute I'm not sure he heard me\nBut if I woke up in his shoes tomorrow if you took my wallet away with with everything I have been through I had no identity no I ... you know my driver's license was gone I didn't have a car and you just dumped me on the street I wouldn't be there long\nBecause they don't believe that about me and my future and I know if I Do this this and this that I'll be out\nAnd I I work my way right out of it I don't I don't know how long it'll take but I Would get there I pushed my way through it and um and I haven't always been that way there's been times that I was so scared so beat up and so hopeless that I couldn't breathe and I couldn't see\nWhat I'm Talking about here is ... is is vision site that\nGives you hope when you lose your site when you can't see the other side of it\nThen then there's no you know that it's hard to take action\nIt it's hard to fix it and the problem is there's not a magic wand there is a series of things you've got to do a series of steps you've got to take to become unstuck wherever it is you are stuck wherever it is I'm\nStuck I think that guy's going to be okay\nReally do I think he's going to be better off than he thinks he's going to be I think it's going to work out\nGreat book to read if you already called pizza tiger the guy that started um dominos pizza Monaghan came out of the army made some bad mistakes and ended up living in a homeless shelter\n\nAnd then he ends up owning dominos pizza at the end the story\nSo it's going to be All right\nYeah it can be\nYou can choose for it to be All right\nIt's not magic is not positive thinking and it's not easy\nAnd it's one of the reasons I read biographies of successful people is he lets me know that they went through crap and they made it\nAnd it and then if I'm going through crap I'm going to make it\nAnd that that's what I'm you know that's where you are where I have been and am sometimes\nIt's going to be okay\nIt's going to turn out okay\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices

I have\nNever seen anything that indicates that scary North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive than the rest of North Carolina I mean now maybe you need to move\nTwenty miles from there instead of a hundred and ten miles from there to get something cheaper but I'm the numbers you're giving me just don't work I I just ah truthfully I think you haven't\nLooked in the right places I think you're looking in certain neighborhoods or certain types of apartment complexes or whatever I'm going to continue shop and learn and I'm probably I mean I'm ... you may need to dial it out pan back a little bit and\nDial out just a little bit mileage was from where you are looking to get you you may be in the most expensive in the town I mean I can imagine that there is an area of carry this that expensive\nBut overall to carry North Carolina is thirty percent more expensive rents them Burlington no that's just I just don't believe that\nUm I can be wrong but I I don't I've never seen that indicates that the one in North Carolina is that much more expensive than the other end now you want to compare Manhattan to apple in Texas we can talk about this but that's a different issue and that's not what you're proposing so I think you're\nUm you look in a different into town of Kerry or you move a little bit further out of carry but not a hundred and ten miles out of Kerry and let's see where we are at that point um\nBut I don't think you can um what your your numbers just don't work I thanks for the call Sharon is with us in West Palm Beach Florida Hi Sharon welcome to the Dave

you\nI'm doing fine good how can I Am I\nMe how I'm a fulltime and about a year left can call I'm part time my ... my income at low and I happened to Iraq on quite a bit of credit card that over the past five years\nI'm forty seven and student about Seventeen out that in a car loan and then sometimes in credit card so\nMhm [noise] so you have a question\nYes my question has um obviously he said I keep doing\nNo you haven't okay [laughter] no you may not use student loans to pay credit cards\nOkay do you have any advice on my income about sixteen and twenty thousand dollars a year with my major Sam I'm just kind of unmanageable right now\nMhm okay well you're first goal is of course to eat and keep the lights on your second goal was finished school when we finished school\n[noise] um I Will be finishing next summer\nSo buddy buddy you\nKnow credit less than a year good so do can tread water till then I had no more new debt that's a victory okay then the second thing would be to pay the actual payments on the credit card just minimum should and will call that a victory\nUh and then the third thing would be if you can actually start to make some progress paying down on though you're not paying anything on the student loans while you're in school right\nRight when you look ahead of time when you say no my language to pay off credit card you know how to ... and it's a really really dumb idea of how you're making a mess and so have you cut up these credit cards um I Know you have to cut them all up [laughter] yeah I don't use them I switched\nTo care of you use them or not drop 'em up oh if I stop using them you have to stop this stuff radically and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you probably need to work more or at a different place\nWell it can't work more because of my school schedule and added the infant probably make about ten an area where I'm located\nOkay well I a little more money on another thousand dollars a month to change your life\nUh-huh\nSo that's what I'm looking at is what what can I Do to create that just on the short term you only got about nine months to your income can change hopefully with a new um\nWith a new job and a new career at that point um but hang on until then and stop borrowing on student loans to pay off credit cards Naomi is in Seattle hey Naomi how are you\nBetter than I deserve thank you sure how can I help um so my husband runs a small business\nFrom home um and it hasn't been bringing in as much as it used to the ... the cat's name like declining steadily and ah so I'm Wondering do we used our home to quit to get another job\nYes um what's wrong with this is why is it dying\nI I'm not sure it just when we used to make a combined income at Fifteen thousand a month and now both of us with the business gets down to five thousand dollar home the mortgages large chunk of what we are now\nOkay I'm a little bit confused 'cause you modeled everything together so how much of the Fifteen thousand was you\nUm about three and ... are you still doing that yes okay so he was making twelve and now he is making seven yes\nNo no no no no no no I was making nothing ... businesses almost disappeared yes you do know what's wrong with it what's wrong with it\nUm I don't know what I have to talk to him I feel like it's just competition and that he he feels like the market it's a lot of online staff of the market flooded with what you think ... um\nSo what what does he do\nHe sells clothes on line\nIn in the last world wants\nUnder the clothing online business that weren't there before and I'm not they are up Ninety percent of his income\nThat yeah that appears to break and and you get a job or needs to fix this business yeah it's going to harm and option can no because there's an fix the problem the homes not the problem the problem is is businesses failing okay\nAnd we have to feed their fix that we have to identify the problems with his business and make the changes to fix the business or we have to get a job and close the business\nWorld I don't care if you start selling something other than close the obviously knew how to sell something on the Internet at one point he was doing very well\nYeah I get a hundred and he's making a hundred and fifty a year yeah anybody for years\nYou know any bad so I mean he knows how to do something with marketing on the Internet some kind of digital marketing\nAnd uh it may be that the product line easy and other species in yacht invaded or maybe he's gotten lazy with his ... and he's not handling is is digital marketing properly or I don't know I Can't tell what's going on but I can tell you this dissident hadn't the right way as it\nYou know it's not\nSo I'm going to give them my friend Henry Cloud wrote a book called necessary endings\nGay\nAnd in that chapter in one chapter in that book he says that when you end something a relationship a job business whatever it is when you into something it's when it's bad and you have lost hope you have no reasonable logical reason to think it's going to get\nBetter and that's when you end it right I mean review if you're\n... where the guy who's been drinking for Twenty years and he says he's gonna quit there is no logical reason to believe him a unless there's evidence to indicate he actually has quitting\nThis time and you you know you're married to a
