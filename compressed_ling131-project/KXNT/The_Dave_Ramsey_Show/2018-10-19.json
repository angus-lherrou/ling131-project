good well I'm Glad I'm Glad you're doing a good that's awesome okay so uh what what are you are thinking of putting the money on [noise]\nSo me and my wife have agreed that we want to use this money to buy a house mhm but\nShe um [noise] we're we're we're we're not agree on is that she wants to put the majority of the money all the down payment and save about twenty thousand for emergencies ... and I think this is a perfect time to get rid of all like that and we also have a good amount for a down payment on a house ...\nAnd still have some leftover bushy agreeing with me with that\nAnd I want to hear your opinion on what you think would be the better move or if you're not agreeing with you I don't know why she would agree with me [laughter]\nBut anyway the uh uh we tell people not to buy a home unless your debt free how much debt do you have\nA together we have about forty five thousand dollars embarrassed\nA house with that still laying around I think that's dangerous you're asking for trouble\nAnd so on and so my vote is going on your side of this argument I'm afraid but I don't know I honestly I don't know why she wouldn't listen to makes now let me tell you this I Will tell you that I Would not do any of this unless you guys get on a budget and you agree to never borrow money again\nOkay yes that I have a track to talk to her about that I'm actually a new economic trying to get her off board mhm but she's not really to come out of also having trouble getting her on board with the plan and his ... you know\nI can imagine so um I I highly recommend you don't do anything until you can come into agreement okay because you're going to make a mistake when you look Shannon I when we have an argument like this we uh we have to we have a rule\nWe have to do nothing until we can come into agreement on large purchases large gifts large decisions we decide nothing is the only thing we can do until we're in agreement\nAnd uh so I I recommend you do nothing until the two of you can get on the same page um do you think that she would go to financial piece university if I gave you a one year membership\nI honestly do think I've been talking to her mother trying to help me out just 'cause she's so stubborn about this and her mother is on my side as well\nAh whereas when I ask what I asked was can you get your wife to go to financial ... university to the nine lessons and if I give you the one year membership\nYes sir you think so why she fresh rubber\nI think that me and my me and her mother would sit down with her and explained to her um\nGo to the climate is free okay I'm going to give it to you but I'm only going to give it to you on the condition that she attends with you OK because if you go by yourself it will cause a divorce is you're going to get more and more and more and more\nExcited about getting out of debt and living with a plan and you get it's going to drive a wedge further between you own I don't want to do that\nSo I just if you can talk her into just attending one or two classes with you I think she'll go on and go to the others I'm pretty persuasive but uh but\nDon't go by yourself do it'll cause problems hold on I'll have Kelly pick up I'll give you the financial ... membership for a year and that includes the nine lessons that you can attend and you can watch them on line and everything else um but do not do this without her it's a it's contingent upon that my gift is\nAll right Dave is with us in Stockton, California Hi Dave how are you\nOh good afternoon Dave how you doing today about her than I deserve what's up well that\nThat's good faith um with my wife and I are if the coordinators had looked at St get free\nAnd we major wisdom and guided something where we also have a little disagreement um last you see after our son got married we loaded with money to help them out really knowing knowing that we would never probably see the money and again okay [noise]\nUm why would you do that you're ... ...\nEmail that that's a good question [laughter] that's a good question I maybe it's because I haven't talked for about a year ago I\nA touch with ... with that aspect of it but um we volunteer to pay for the material that they take a class which they did but in the end they did and discipline Metallica ... principles\nAnd Henri building a ... fan at all\nWell after six months we decided in the ...\nDiscipline Metallica ... principles\nAnd or building a ... at all mhm well after six months we decided to see what kind of make the U.S back anything we kind of let them know we weren't not alone in the more money because they had made no effort to to reimburse anything of it and and there was no communication between now indicating the owner famous back\nWell you know as life goes several months later they're only vehicle book down and um and it could not be repaired and my son had no way to get to work\nAnd this is where it gets\nSticky let 'em knowing that my wife had to take care of her parents trashed would be dispersion funds to all the fisheries including him we both agreed to Frank about Ninety percent of what the what we see with the understanding the

thousand dollar loans to pay off for months of overdo rent the otherwise they'd be um evicted and our daughter live if there's not one of the work to help out\nSo my angel is interested in ... mirrors and because they have not given strict responsibility came back with our loan I have strongly suggested ... and I I think that's about as far as that goes to this is my wife's side that my wife write the check to them have them come over and sided over just\nAnd we would write them a check for that balance of what they didn't borrow ... ... we didn't we didn't read them and it seems simple and we

I'm In a couple of weeks ... ... ... a week later I going to a wedding expo and Columbus but I'm struggling to see how should I did that when\nI'm you know that we're struggling to pay that mhm and um you know is it worth it to go to the wedding ... at least I I Do want to go to ...\nFamily one hundred percent satisfaction guaranteeing a lot of people have a satisfactory\nHere and there was a number of satisfaction guarantee but I never heard of a satisfaction guaranteed that includes if you screw\nUp as a customer screws up and you're you're not satisfied because you messed up well that's kind of like on you right not what these guys if you missed measure the blind or you pick the wrong color they'll replace it free wow that satisfaction guarantee I'm telling you cite wide savings are happening right now let's take an additional five\nPercent off that blondes dot com slash Ramsey it's how you get the deal blondes dot com slash Ramsey Linda in Tennessee says unfortunately I allowed myself to fall\nInto the credit card game I have two cars were the same balance card one charges twenty seven point nine percent interest card to charge nine point nine which one do I attack and pay off first or if they're the same balances you pay off the interest rate first\nBut I think there's a bigger problem Linda\nThe Bible says out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks what's going on inside of you causes you to choose the words that\nYou use you need to stop talking like you were talking\nI allowed myself to fall into the credit card game no you didn't you walk straight up signed up for the card there was no falling you're not a victim\nYou walk straight up and signed up for stupid\nAnd you did it on purpose own it\nI've done a lot dumber than you've done ghetto but I Walk straight up and signed up for stupid and as long as I blame\nThe government or I blamed amino banker I blame the IRS or I blame the economy I was not getting any better and I did I sat around and wind like it was a former like I was a form of prayer\nBut you got to own it you didn't fall into credit card that you've ever heard anybody say I was forced to buy a car well bull crap you are not\nNo one's ever forced you to do anything they didn't have a gun at the car dealerships by car I'm going to shoot you there was no collusion there was no extortion you weren't forced to buy a car you want to freaking car and you rationalize the crowd out of it\nStop lying to yourself it's one of the steps you have to take to get your life straightened out\nSo you didn't allow yourself to fall you walk straight up and signed up for stupid\n\nSay it like it is and it'll help you in the healing process I Know because I had to go through the same thing to me knows where there's a New Jersey may know how are you\nHey Dave how are you a better than I deserve how can I help\nPerson Oh thanks for taking my call 'em my question is I'm and I'm up to a park actually the first one um I I make about forty to forty five ... a year\nOr I support a family of four and I ... I work for a place to serve if they have a get a student loan debt of like um about Fifteen thousand dollars\nAnd um [noise] um two friends one of them and I'm asking me to go for business\nBeing thousand dollars [noise] and um [noise] I have two friends one of them as I'm asking me to go for a business or like a friend um subway business so I was thinking about taking a loan for that and\nMy other friend if I'm all for me like to go buy a house with him to the share like a two family house so I take one apartment he thinks the other and it's going to be of course with a mortgage loan chose so I wanted to know what should I Do\nMhm mhm well we tell folks don't have to borrow money around here if you listen to the show very much the shortest\nPath to wells and peace in your finances is to avoid that and on top of that I Would tell you to avoid partnerships as the only ship that won't sale\nSo um what that means is that if you still want to remain friends with both these guys I Would suggest you say no because at the end of these stories there was a nightmare\nGoing in partners with somebody in debt to go into the restaurant business would you will know squat about is a good way to end up bankrupt and lose your friendship forever going in partners with somebody to buy a house\nAnd then he doesn't pay is half or can't pay his nap or you don't pay your for camp a year and a half is uh when I was a precursor to the ending of our friendship\nAnd a foreclosure shown no I wouldn't do either one of those\nAnd that's my reasoning I think you'll have a lot better life have you avoid both of those paths and you can you can develop a career path that does not involve you're going into debt to start a business it's a matter of fact most businesses start without that\nThey just start small we started this one without the card table my living room we didn't have a big fancy studio we went down in the local radio station drove over there and they let us use their stuff because we work for free there\nWell you figure out a way to get going and you what we call bootstrap it and it works but you don't have to go get an SBA loan and go deeply in debt\nAbout subway franchise in order to be in business that some mythology Thomas is with us in Philadelphia Hi Thomas how're you\nDave thank you very much for taking my call sure what's up\nI'm I just graduated with a degree in actuarial science back in may wow and I'm working at McDonald's making nine dollars an hour why I I've been applying and applying and I just I Can't find a job and I don't know what to do\n... well I I Would assume that the primary job for that would be an insurance companies correct\nYeah I I've [noise] through the end my last year of of school I got very turned off the actuarial science so I've been applying to finance jobs and I can't get anything because every one kid everyone wants to have experience and\nI don't have the experience and I I graduated early so I did I did summer classes and they can't\nDo internships for summer classes so kind of on what kind of an angel job or you tried into\n\nFinancial analyst financial I'm like I've I've been\nEven doing accounting like accounts payable any mhm receivables\nEntry level stuff mhm oh you do is get your foot in the door I'm OK well here's here's one thing I Will tell you and Ken Coleman will tell you this is will go to the Ken Coleman show dot com and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in applications without religion\nDot com and download his free PDF on how to put together a resume but resumes in applications without relationship are useless\nUm I'll give you an example uh we have eight hundred people here just under a hundred people work on our team we hired a hundred and fifty to two hundred last year we had Fifteen thousand the applications\nFor those honored hires\nYou get lost in that ... and ... there's not that I don't wanna answer and talk to every one of those Fifteen thousand people is just logistically not reasonable\nAnd so what ends up happening is you get lost in the stock of that stuff unless you know someone that works there and you don't have to be best friends with them you just 'cause I got to tell you we don't ever hire somebody because somebody called me and says are ever but we would give them an interview\nAnd pull their pull the resume out of the stack\nYou got to get out of the pile you know and so some of these places are trying to get on with you need to figure out if your sister that's married\nA kid play soccer where the guy that works over there or something like that where you can find someone that will put in a little bit of a word for you to at least get the door open\nAnd that'll get you in the door again you're you're not going to get hired because of that kind of a reference matter of fact there are very few references where you just calls up somebody and I get your hired an almost never happens that'll decent job anyway\nI mean if they're hiring just bodies you need an all or something like that but at a good job they're really going to want to interview you and learn about trees and that will be true here so we don't guarantee anybody a higher but we will at least talk to them and you know what might be a very short conversation no you don't qualify than setting or looking for\nBut at least we'll talk to them and give the resume out of the file [noise]\nIf somebody knows I'm Sorry go download that and listen we can show he'll help you and all this stuff is very very just falls out there but I think you can leave some\n[noise]\n\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q ... when getting your mortgage you really think he cares about your longer money goes boy doesn't\n[laughter] but this is an amazing story very well done thank you very well not well you did exactly\nWhat I Try to get doctors to do most dogs come out and go\nFinally worked all this time I've gone to school my whole party can live mhm I deserve a new house in a new car I deserve a trip and they spend money like water you've seen them do it oh yeah definitely and it's crazy and this did all you do would you you just kept living like a broke college student\nYeah and I think that was really the key to getting out of that was just to keep living like a resident while I was in his first few years out because that was really the easiest time to do it and so I think that was probably the most important stuff that I thought yeah\n'cause now I I mean you make three hundred four hundred five hundred wherever you make it it's you're going to be unbelievably will hit so you spend your whole thirty thirty one thirty one\nWow with this fabulous and congratulations I guess I'm so proud of you who was your biggest cheerleader I Know you have to have the tractors that was easy yeah but who is the biggest cheerleader or\nI Would say my parents or my mom had followed you for years and also people in my church family as well because they are I talked a lot about you and we're encouraging me not to look into because they knew I had a lot of student loans\nYeah yeah so I mean you went from being completely crushed by student loan debt to completely owning it\nYeah I felt like I was suffocating under the day I remember being so scared when I was sitting there and actually looking at the balance is and I didn't know if it was even going to be possible to get out but I didn't really have another planet so I figured I'm just going to\nGo with you know Dave Ramsey and stick with it and just commit to it and see what happens in twenty two months later I Am a final payment\nYou paid off almost two hundred thousand a year for two years mhm Minnesota rate you were on which is pretty incredible\nBut you're making four Fifteen modest taxes which takes a big chunk of and so you weren't living you weren't you weren't splurging on anything now uh you weren't starving to death but you weren't splurging and and just completely leaned or so as you're going lawyer you're hitting this thing\nWhen you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty month only given month\nSo as you're going along you're you're hitting this thing when you're hitting it almost twenty thousand bucks a month yeah a Fifteen to twenty a month to only given month at what point when you started doing that did you go wait a minute this was actually going to work how far in war you before the before kind of the ... which kind of flipped for you\nWell I paid off all the smallest ones first I had a total of twenty different student loans and so they were to attack the smallest ones first and then once I saw how easy it was to do that\nAnd then I started to have some more hope that I Would be a what a pay off the largest ones I think my largest individual alone was right around fifty thousand dollars and prior to that I just looked at it and it was like there was no way like there's not going to be able to do this\nSo your trunk and some of these like one or two a month yeah knocking on the little baby ones when you first started yeah\nAnd that yeah but I had to give you a lot of emotional boost deaf in his debt snowball really kicked in for you then they did what he was supposed to do it let you know that this is going to work mhm wow wow wow wow wow wow All right so what is the big takeaway when someone says\nOh I I'm a ... year hundreds of thousands I Can't get out of debt you say yes you can here's what you do you do this\nI think the most important thing is\nJust to stop burning from it stop trying to hide from it like I was trying to do um I was I just felt crushed and it was you know so afraid that I Would never get a day and I once I faced it and once I took personal responsibility for it\nAnd you realize that I'm the one who signed the papers ... you know I Need to get myself out uh then I just made a plan and stuck with it and made the commitment to change or your parents' good with money\nAnd they are their income as much less I'm sure they know what mine is but I learned most people's\n[laughter]\nYeah I definitely learned how to live on a budget that from my parents and also um they had been in quite a bit of a credit card debt in the past they always told me you know don't be stupid with credit card ... I'm ... more purchases and so I think I learned a lot of those principles and then\nYou know there was a there was a sense of character that came from them that they cause you're able to do this is what I was thinking\nYeah very good very good one proud I mean I Know they are well done very well done what a great great story we've got a copy of Chris ... book for you retire inspired that's the next chapter in your story\nAnd we want you to go and be a millionaire you'll be that in about twenty minutes and uh and outrageously generous as we go along well done very very well done\nTouch down April from state College Pennsylvania hundred and eighty thousand dollars played all been twenty two months making four Fifteen E.
