really well\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nI'm so my question is ah if my parents died with student loan debt and my and my siblings responsible for that\nIf who who is the student loan debt on and did you sign for it\nAh my mother and my mother's I actually don't know how much it is\nOkay so she borrowed money to go to school and she signed for it you didn't sign for it you weren't the student\nOkay is that what you're saying is that what you said yes\nOkay if that's the case you are not liable for it now when a when she dies if she has that the debt will be paid by the sale of the items that she ... before airs receive anything\nShow when you die what you own is sold to pay off your debt and if there's anything left\nThat's distributed to the air's\nOkay\nBut you are not let let's say she dies penniless and she has three hundred thousand dollars in student loan debt the student loan debt people getting\nNothing no one will pay them no one is liable to pay them okay\nBut if she has a three hundred thousand dollar paid for house it would be sold and we would pay off the student loan debt before you guys got anything in that example if there is a three hundred thousand learned that three hundred thousand dollar house they would you would get nothing they would get paid\nOkay 'cause she's a so I'm refinanced our parents um I'm trying to get into the tests what houses and I'm On top of the student loan debt\nYou know so you're you're basically saying she's doing stupid on parade\nYeah my father is um kind of given up trying to teach her and he he gets kind of keeping their finances are separated from what I understand yeah\nLike us on the followers on Twitter on the news talk gate forty a M. K. U. T.\nValuable joining us America this is the Dave Ramsey show why you're here Joanna is with us in Los Angeles are Joanne welcome to the day room to show how can I help\nHide anything for taking my call Cher which I find\nSo we're currently on baby steps one on we've been on a plan for a month and I'm David ... to ... so we're in the process of getting a life insurance um evidence part of the last uh\nI mean I spent a summer that his dad took out and how the I had a full term policy on him when he was younger and he wants to eventually take that over and make the\nPayments um I don't know what that is um but we have four kids I'm not exactly sure\nWhat the best thing to do if I'm not the beneficiary to that it or how to handle it\nMhm okay so he took the shot when your husband was a child yeah\nThis is not a term policy it's a whole life life insurance policy\nAnd it's close to half a million dollars\nWow that should be canceled okay\nBecause her whole life insurance policy about ... million dollars is a very expensive\nRight yeah yeah and like my main concern is you know we found out the beneficiary and I don't I mean he's a great guy so I'm not worried about you know that it's\nOut on my own view it as a guy doesn't matter at a good guy that's it's it's really weird that it's continued to have the parents are the beneficiary and this is a grown man with family of four with four kids\nYeah there is a ... and like a great now um you know a wild one\nBut it's strange how long have you been married for a long you been married for five years you know the five years they've not address this issue but strength mhm but you know really I mean they should\nI mean they should you should address the issue and then they should not be the beneficiaries anymore you should be and really the policy ought to just be canceled\nBecause I Would I Would not want to pick up the ... I Would not want to pick up the premiums and a half a million dollar policy on there's a whole lot of policy because it's twenty times more expensive than term to create an investment inside of it called cash value that has a poor right of return that when you die they keep your money\nSo hold her whole life insurance is a horrible financial product\n[noise] and so if you just call me up and you just owned a half a million dollars a whole life I Would say cancel it as soon as you got your term in ...\nBut you're not paying for it today anyway so today you get your term insurance symbolizes proper on you and on your husband and I I think your husband should have a discussion with his dad and say that\nI'm I'm gonna go ahead and suggest you drop that policy now I Will not be taking over I Do not want it and I don't think you ought to continue with the expense of it I think you ought to drop it\nRight yeah that's right I don't want anything to pay that kind of thing I Do not know that it can but you have like I said\nWell it's not only not ... because we're not going to take it over and that was the original plan I plan has now changed yep 'cause you you may decisions as an adult isn't that amazing Steve is with us in Carlsbad, California Hi Steve how are you\nHow are you today [noise]\nBetter than I deserve what's up\nYeah I'm a question uh regarding out part of my retirement savings said commentators I called a pension from my company and that\nOverall is a bad guy eight percent of my total as ... or\n... or ...\nOh well it's I mean a person it's projected to be a at a project that retirement they are two hundred and eighty four thousand dollars and that is that would be about eight percent of my total aspect you know and\nAnd my question is whether good at it as a lump sum yes or ... okay\nYes here's why okay if you die or not if you die when you die [laughter] 'cause we're all gonna die [laughter] okay when you die a that money's gone\n'cause it's a pinch of it and you get your ... and you if you have a survivor benefit or something there it may it may go to your spouse for a while but when your spouse you and your spouse die even if there's a survivor benefits the money's gone it's gone\nAnd if you live are as long as you live it's going to pay at a rate of about five percent in this current market\nSo it's as if you had an account and the investment advisor said Okay Steve we've got an account for you over here two hundred eighty five thousand you can invest it you make five percent on your money and when you die the money's gone\nOr you can take that two hundred and eighty five thousand you can roll went into some mutual funds in a good IRA roll over and mutual funds will perform better than five percent and when you die the money stays with your family well that'd be a better deal\nRight\nYeah I just [laughter] that's what I was thinking yeah versus a hundred percent joint and survivor annuity but Mm uh\nIt's still one of your job and you know you got survivorship on it but when both of you out of the same concept applies so the bottom line is it's got a decent but low rate of return while you live but the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you\nDie makes this a bad deal and so you always take pension lumps on are all\nBut the fact that you lose all the money when the two of you die\nMakes this a bad deal and so you\nAlways take pension lumps on are almost always type engine lumps arms enroll them die of race and invest them and good roast our mutual fund so it sounds like your network didn't exist were making\nA yeah it's a closer to close that and that's probably about four oh well yeah total\nTotal network to assets house so forth\nYou know well ... congratulations how old are you I'm sixty three white ago how much of this did you inherit\n[noise] um probably somewhere in a hurry to four hundred range from both my my my family and my wife's family\nWhere are you a millionaire or that was before that happened\nA a millionaire both for my wife's mother passed away yes uh when my mom my my parents type reality typically young at that point in time not a millionaire no\nSo would you say that you have a four million dollar net worth because of inheritance or because of your savings patterns\nA holding pattern or because of the amount of heritage is is maybe ... percent maybe ... percent\nIt's home lowest irrelevant yeah OK cool yes I'm I'm always researching and asking millionaires how they did it for the benefit of our listeners because I got a twenty four year old listening right now that's got the opportunity of hearing from an actual sixty four year old person who actually has a four million dollar net worth what would you tell about twenty four year old how how should they be you when they grow up\n[laughter] [noise]\nWell I certainly you got to a live well below your means when they are a modest lifestyle which ah we\nHave done and I think also too I I I Know when I was you people do stupid things I've done the stupid things ... I think if you can only make\nStupid thing that that should do along the way that's good I like that they\nMake tires McKay every every everybody listening right now is has done or will\nDo stupid things but then you can minimize those new things\nAlong the way in a way of a modest lifestyle with below you mean um yeah Lloyd\nSo do you think there'll be done in that twenty four year old still have a four million dollar net worth forty years from now if you're listening to me right now\nBut he is probably probably even higher if they if they minimize those to pick them maybe I get minimize or as much along the way yes\nVery well done well congratulations sir man you've done very very well [noise] so yeah I Would roll your pension into an IRA and that way it survives you and it's that simple the math on networks to your benefit a at a Wal alive if you put it in mutual funds and upon death\nFor sure you come out three hundred grand to have\nA question about it a thank you for joining us and thanks for letting me interview you for a minute there it's always good for people here how to be a real millionaire\nOh I Love this millionaire subject is so intriguing\nYou're going to be hearing more from room to solutions on enough from us [laughter] I promise this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nA a problem is this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business\nPutting you know you don't work I was a financial advisor then your company is a you're talking about your right one K. and stuff okay All right yeah not just grab one of the smart Mr pros\nOff our website people when we indoors and sit down with them um have your mom Saddam to even if she's a just so she

just so she kinda knows what's going on and we're going to shut the money in something that's going to generate a little income than have to generate a lot she's only a couple of hundred bucks shorter months mhm and if that's sixty just generates six thousand dollars a year that's five hundred bucks a month maybe does half that you're still okay\nSo what we're saying is is that you know that there's this houses really poorly managed\nDoing hardly anything [noise]\nYeah if it comes and goes there's been a couple of years where it was about seven hundred a month in LA but the last year I think that any\nKind of women if she's getting a seven hundred a month office housewives in fact I bring her three hundred dollar shortfall\nIt was and it was building um her checking account but there's been other factors I wanted to keep it simple they drain or checking account\nOkay I Gotcha yeah then let's catch it out and put it in a good mutual fund or a couple of good mutual funds from

was kind of in the plan which we could basically jumpstart through a baby step three and take the money put uh some of the other money put it in as our emergency fund and then either rent for a short period of time what we built up more of a down payment or use the money and buy smaller property\nI'm and smaller house um that uh that we can you know that will enjoy\nMhm so I [noise] um\n\nSaying gee soggy forty I Am in the\nCity [noise]\n[noise] I give her joining us America was the lead you are with us this is the Dave Ramsey show Marian is with us in New York City Hi Marion how are you\nHi how are you trying to send the fan and thank you for having me on your show\nCertainly thank you how can I help\n[noise] okay [noise] so I've been following your plan for like a couple of months now I had the emergency finals and I'm working on baby step too good a night and I had made progress not a ton of Iraq as the John ...\nA night issue is idea of a chronic illness and I still work fulltime I Am not letting it take over my life is good and my question is is how do I I check 'em for my deductible\nAnd it ended up recently I recently switched health plans to lead stuff above started again I'm also the chronic illness you're going to hit\nThe adoptable every year right um it's\nA thing that if nothing on the go it it it's not they don't see it and it's not life threatening are you going to do it while every year\nNow okay so ... what what is the nature of this what was the nature of the illness\nI mean I don't want to go into detail that Iran is a it's an error pain condition and the doctors are unsure of where it comes time okay God and\nSo it was over there but I Do is I'm sure because it's relatively new yard I yeah\nWell what I Would do is just try to estimate what you think it's going to cost you a year\nAnd the more experienced got to help you that you have with is the better your estimates are badly because once you've ... battle with it for five years you're you're going to kind of know a five year average versus five months you're kind of guessing what it's going to cost you in a year right\nRight and you just put that in his budget item so let's just make up a number okay if you're the duck double was six thousand and you're going to run through your six thousand order duck double every year then that's five hundred bucks a month if it's three thousand dollars a year\nThis is going to cost me out of pocket that's two hundred and fifty a month and I just put a you know a a whatever\nA line in your budget for medical expense ongoing frantic medical\nWhen just call you call it chronic or whatever just give it a name and the money set aside for that so that every\n'cause it's kind of like we know it's going to come up and leave a little while now someday hopefully you'll find a cure and you know it's not a lifetime of this or something not yeah but for now for now you're saying it's predictable\nOr that you're going to have issues we just don't know how severe or expensive they are going to be up into your future and so so much for the next so many months we need to just be budgeting is if we think we're going to spend X per year divided by twelve in your monthly budget\n... I mean my issue is is that I'm literally on\nLike penny pinching I don't like to see where I can make that happen so what I've been hearing is I mean I decided starting next month I'm going to kick out fifty dollars that you live in right now on what I I'm I'm hoping overtime I'll deal with it you know pay out more\nSo why are we finally got an income problem a debt problem or a spending problem where\nI got minded that problem [laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that I make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because\n[laughter] I'm I'm sixty thousand I that I make I don't think a lot on the license social worker and because of my condition actually switch that job I had more functionality\nOn Sunday that fee for service division as opposed to a salary position mhm and then they make anywhere from Thirteen hundred to Fifteen hundred ... a paycheck and\nAnd you get paid twice a month on my desk twice a month okay and you said you're living with them\nAnd I guess I'm I'm living with a roommate I pay nine Seventy five for rent you give us a lot um and I do get some help from my\n... and what is the nature of the debt student loan\nPratt is everything credit card I also because they can have said I was trying lot of holistic thing mhm I'm not at all and then it's student loan or most of it is like so cut it out there that have like a total of sixty thousand\nOkay show for the short term we're going to make sure you take care of the most important things and that food pantry not eating not eating out friday and you're paying more than your life from your lights and water and your rent and your transportation so food shoulders loading and transportation and utilities the eighth\nGrade we used to call that a civics lesson what's in the sense of the necessities are on the debt you've got is not necessities you take care of the debt only after you've taken care of the necessities and then you work as an end of the debt as you can\nAnd here's the thing you're either going in here for these medical expenses or they're going to be new\nDebt right because they are coming you told me that that's why you called yeah yeah yeah\nI don't it's not me declaring it I'm saying right actually I've I've got ... medical how to prepare for it you save uncover it so\nNow that's our short term long term okay we got to get your income up and you're out go down to knock this debt out long term but that has to do with your medical condition and has to do with your career and has to do with a lot of different things that you've got to face\nAnd so um but that's how I Would you begin to look at it get to take care of the short term make sure you're taking care of you so that you\nCan you know be prepared to take on the long term which is get your income up\nBut ah we got to get past some of the medical stuff and you've got to really start looking at this career really hard chop up those credit cards it's time for a plastic surgery Tucker is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Tucker how are you [laughter] I'm doing well how are you better than I deserve what's up\nWell me and my wife um I go on the baby step through right now I'm In fact we just paid off our second credit card today though we are dollar credit card and move on if they don't mind\nThat is good news um [noise] but um so we're working the babies that too and we're looking at our budget and yesterday at um after church we had a big argument about tithing\nI don't know if we want to ... percent and um I realized that we were not in a position to give right now we're trying to pay all that we can give later\nOn on what what I think what the economy new models that I'm kind of I thought the eighth of all I Want to get your input on it\nWe have our ten percent by it but we want to die without thinking about putting data and given back to the church and then having that extra five percent and kind of giving it to 'em or their charitable organizations that we believe in that are that are doing\nExtra five percent and kind of giving it to um other charitable organization that we believe in that are arguing that the ... you know when the crisis mission and so we're trying to looking at trial give what we can to people who need it\nUm but if she don't love and walk straight and present a church and bank of what we don't what we can't give you know we're not efficient media and she wants to give it a chart we had a big argument about five and yesterday was\nOut on the the definition of dies the definition of the time is when you look it up in the Hebrew it's an Old Testament term in Jesus reaffirmed it in the New Testament is tense it literally means chance the word means tent\nIt doesn't mean fear that doesn't mean twentieth it means to him now you can decide whether you want to tie they're not you get to decide that um but if we're going to walk with Christ and we want to and we I'm an evangelical Christian which means I look for what the scripture tells me to do\nI'm doing my best to follow what the word of God says and so what ... opinion is doesn't matter what Tucker ... Tucker's opinion is doesn't matter\nI'm looking for what God says to do in his love letter to me and he says Tucker and Dave I'm I'm you're my kid I'm Crazy about you I Love you and um you can give are not\nGiven I'll still love you the best way to live your life is to to gifts\nAnd all throughout the Old Testament and Jesus reaffirmed that then the New Testament\nIs a ties attempts of urine from evangelicals have taught and believe for Fifteen hundred years that that five is your baseline minimum giving and it comes off the top before you do anything else and it goes to your local church [noise] so if you want to biblical answer\nYour wife wins the arguing [noise] that's the biblical not your wife and his argument but she was correct biblical [laughter]\nActually both are probably true [laughter]\nGood luck with that rather [laughter]\nOrder to be a successful business owner you have to be prepared for change as an example let's talk about the huge changes in tax reform\nSo one oh finally includes cars\nYes it includes the cars\nFifty on cars and what's the other fifty five on\nA thirty three thousand on student loans a little bit of the majority of my wife's ah about eight thousand on line and a twenty two thousand is on other like credit cards and stuff like that\nGot it and what's your household income [noise] um well I got fired from my previous job that was there about five and a half years and um we're making about one one oh five one twenty ... a year\nWhere did you used the amount of the old drum\nYeah that that's what I was making before a yes before okay um what do you make now why now I'm\nIn real estate I'm actually I got my license in March in June ... June was my first day in real estate mhm I've got to choose a house is sold six listings and ending clothing bought into a second week of November So\nWhat is your projected income for a vote that six month period of time\nI'm I'm thinking maybe like twenty five thousand by the end of the year and that was\nWhat does your why didn't make of the one who\nMakes fifty a she made a fifty one dollars that\nOkay so basically it sounds like in real estate you're going to make as much as you used to make\nYes okay good good news right\nI guess right now what she's worried about is that she's bringing in most of the income because of course it's slow when you first start out I'm only selling to houses that between that long span 'em and hurt thing if she wants to keep her car because she's saying she's making money to pay her car [laughter]\n'cause that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nGet to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married\n[noise] okay that's not how it works when we're married that's how it works when your roommates\nYou get to do whatever you want when your roommates but when you're married it's for richer for four and sickness and health and onto the all my worldly goods I pledge is what the old marriage vows sad\nAnd so it you know if you want to be divorced you get to keep whatever you want to Cape if you want to be married we are doing this together\nIn other words if she gets cancer you don't look at her and go oh you just you can handle that cancer thing there by yourself and those trips that came out you get to do that by yourself you're not going to do that to her right no no you would take care of her because we are now one\nWhen we're married and and it's ... percent in health and right now the house a sick and so we don't get to be a print system be selfish that's not an option sorry\nYes and and um that's what I was trying to explain to her that we need it my my truck it's for sale already I have it on the\nMarket good I'm actually ended up as soon as I Do some of these\nClosing the courts will have if I can get what I was asking for what you what it what I oh\nI'm going to pay the difference to get rid of it completely good um what\nIs called the ... and that's what I was trying to tell her to as I'll get a car cash and then she tells her car and then what have at least one car right now\nWell I don't know I ... I don't agree with that I Would get her a car and I'm not sure we're going to move down and out of her car if you can make fifty five thousand\nIf you can get these closings and everything you've gotten the pipeline it sounds like you're pipelines pretty good it's just it's been tough from the lay off and on the firing until now but here's the money that you've got piled up the business that you have coming\nShould create the income they used to have if I heard you correctly\nYes and and like I told her like she's she's worried that it's not coming in fast enough and I told her there are ending or clothing by then the second week of November everything should be closed do stay close\nTo three weeks from now yeah I mean so three weeks from now all this goes away so here's what I Would I Would not\nSell her car today I Would show your trial today and I but I Would\nI Would say I would tear this this this ridiculous philosophy that she has all the ...\nI'm not putting up with that crap okay this idea that outlined make money I can keep ... well that's if your roommates that's just BS okay I'm not going with that\nSo uh but uh but but the idea that I think she should keep her car and I think the two of you and I think you're going to be making enough money that then the two of you could work through a budget\nThat has not a hundred and five thousand dollars worth of that making about a little over a hundred but instead has about Seventy five thousand dollars of debt making a little over a hundred if both of you are willing to roll up your sleeves and\nPay off thirty seven dollars an hour for the ... a year for two years we can keep her car but if you're not willing to do that as I household then you don't have a financial trouble your marriage trouble then\nYou know she's not willing to join armed with you and fight and outside enemy that has come at your house and instead she goes to her corner with her toys you have a marriage\nProblem okay but hopefully you guys can get on the same page when you back all for her car a little bit\nYou run around and started selling mama's car is not weigh a good way to get mom on board halo so let's try that other approach 'cause I think it's reasonable financially to keep her car if your income goes ... looks like your income you're going to go\nBut if it that and then you might be looking at a different career and he's going to be looked at us on our cars and you get hurricane car to drive you drive a cheap car while we get this ... this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if they're reading you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it there ... they never live up to the expectations the resorts set and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely\nLegally and forever is with timeshare exit team\nThey have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to find a solution they've executed thousands of timeshare owners this year alone there are the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and time sure it's a team of so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full\nRefund called eight for for none none none exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for none none none exit or timeshare exit team dot com\nHey sugar land join us as we support DEA national prescription drug take back day Saturday October twenty seven\nIf you don't get rid of those on user expired prescriptions do clearing up your medicine cabinet they could end up misplaced stolen or simply misused\nProtect your family and the community and let talking prescription drugs out of the wrong hands keep them safe clean 'em out take them back find a collection site near you at D.

D\n[laughter] thanks for joining\nFive five five Andy and fresh or in the lobby of Ramsey solutions\nJust stopped by because there was a neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska really much safer going by guys are yeah thanks for having I\nSaw it absolutely so you guys have a question we do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit attrition I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs in a while in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nCamp will be a uh the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is ... ... all and we'll be rented or we currently own that property currently on their property and we'll be living on it also\n... and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and then you would carry lots\nBicker and what kind of a insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I'd be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the tenant they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or you and the company separate from the non profit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure 'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nOr I Would keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do some ... let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land you know you got mess on your hands up the land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying that they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings\nThe business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability associated with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenant for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying it's a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the types of uh of interests people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance a I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to State Farm and get an airplane insurance okay then we'll salad I might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you had said you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the the if there's a crash wrote what happened in the same kinda thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families or adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that writes your policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs so much in this cover company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\nDoes it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in your shoes is but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but um\nThey eat and\nThere are no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay and\n\nI ability okay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins\nGuy and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that or you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly and stole the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management move your your managing your risk but I hold harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on his people honest right it's like do you know you are you are walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped you\nKnow and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his on or you know if he doesn't have any of the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check\nBut you need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and having attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler a expedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles use on these two page documents that are all found Brenda about how if you die you're not ... they're not liable they're still level\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so yeah I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't say thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a\nJump in and we'll talk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a ... and and I knew now so I Apologize that this is something that you've touched on I'll Try\nAnd find new to the baby fat and I know that number one is saying the thousand dollar an American the fine mhm my question is do you ever think gaff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing to happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm but I'm just wondering how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get back to baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an honest stable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but\nWhat I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice do they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and they're never happened to act really lucky we've never been laid off and let you go to the parents\nAnd we've been working for three years owner never happened to act like it was never been laid off and they get home pretty quick I mean within a\nCouple of weeks some she'd have a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to find something to do when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I Would push pause on the whole total moneymaker baby step thing and this pile of cash but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about it as what we all have and that's why we get out of that\nOne of the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run\nAnd um that would be baby step for and I do that first and\nYeah you'd be a baby step forward and you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income away and um that would be baby step for and I do that first Ina Ross IRA and then I Do it in a ... T S P after that if they're matching of don't think they do but if they're managing you on the ... going to start their with Iraq with a match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country really appreciate is going to talk to you\nMartin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave hey\nWell I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to weather actually sell my rental property to pay off my primary residence or and pay off any other dead also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nOkay so your debt free but two cars and two houses right okay how much do you own your cars\nI'm fifty thousand on balls each or total on both total okay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty\nOkay you got a lot of car and um so what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm\nAnd the rental and um my rental Ohio one takes the end is worth about I Would say or thirty Philip has four fifty but I if I'm at a little bit less okay\nSo I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we state taken say um you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and until I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off in well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide\nI'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental for probably go ahead and pay off the rental um might pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing what forty fifty grand a year and that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car I'm ordering soul the rental now be done\nRight I mean that's what I really had a question whether to to do that and and pay off most pretty much tell the rent on pay off pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind that for that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in three years he's going to go to college\nI don't have a house payment you can cash flow that right okay\nYou know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check that out there next time you get right by a car you have paid cash for I'm All right you never moral money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that's that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of debt horse it\nDoesn't work you can't shorter routed me got to ride him or not\nSo if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental\nAnd pay off everything cash flow college and have saved up bought me some other rentals with cash or go alone out there in the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff\nHaving done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have and go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff but you got to stop it you got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle then yeah dumped the rental and pay off the cars would pay off the house on them\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building George junior college fund and then once you've got junior college covered um by just don't want to start in a savings account to junior college junior soldiers do it in their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then I'm\nA ... then once that's done then you just start saving up paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the ...
