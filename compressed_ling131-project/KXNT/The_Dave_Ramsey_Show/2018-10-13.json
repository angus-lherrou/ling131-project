lord I got a guy who should I put it on\nSo how do you start over your start over a\nWiser and a less naive about financial things\nSo whatever kind of debt that you know you know ended up in the bankruptcy its reminder to avoid that right\nAnd we know that an outside variable a horrible tragedy\nUh caused your financial trouble but had you had a pile of cash and absolutely no doubt at all you probably could have survived that so that's our new goal is to become wealthy without any bad\nAnd so as life uh lives opportunities and problems come along you're in better shape to tackle either and so how can we quickly most quickly rebuild your financial life now that you're rebuilding your overall life\nAnd uh that's the stuff you're hearing me teach every day that's get on a written plan a budget\nOr avoid that build up an emergency fund and then begin investing long term um and as you're able to get out on your own again medically and financially you will do that to re establish yourself as a you know a single young twenty eight year old guy that doesn't live at home or no shame in that game right now\nBut a long term you'll want to be out right just like you want to have the dignity of your whole life\nUh so that's a cool thing uh but you know the basic stuff we talk about here saving for emergencies investing being generous avoiding that\nUm you know living are written

Watertown South Dakota Hi Michelle how are you\nAnd we'll get Dave thank you for taking my call certainly how can I help\nUm well I just starting to get program and August I'm I have currently pay down three thousand dollar that um that just got to actually that's that I was making paint like on my way pain they finally found\nUm now I Need to start on like that that will collection which will get out of out in dollars\nMhm [noise] and I've already received a lot of like settlements in the mail mhm last like I had a federal keen hundred dollar bill that they're they're they're from David take seven hundred for a friend of mine like telling me that that thousands of dollars that were given\nMhm that I have to pay taxes on that at the end of the year and I was just wondering if you have it true\nThat is true that is not giving us except on a mortgage on your home is a taxable income and they likely will send you a ten Ninety nine for the amount that day for gays\nA cashier what's your household income [noise]\nUm [noise] it it's very very it's about how about forty five thousand is here\nOkay let's say let's say you're a ... percent tax bracket as an example okay let's pretend if you were in a twenty percent tax bracket and you had a thousand dollars in forgiveness that didn't cost you a thousand dollars and only talked to two hundred dollars\nRight\nAnd so it's still a good deal with your yeah your I have about two hundred dollars per thousand so that is forgiven that'll hit your taxes if they ten Ninety nine you\nIf they don't you have no obligation to list it and I would just wait until you know they do that if they follow through on that but it's in the larger the forgiveness is the more likely they will follow through with a ten Ninety nine\nAnd send you that but as you get that then you will do the taxes so\nYeah I'd I'd get ready for some taxes at tax time that I'm by April ... you know that you may have in in addition to that now if you had a large return coming because you're over withholding\nWell in in that case so you're just going to lower your return because you need to change your withholding anyway so good question thank you for\nU.S

specific dollar amounts with every one or just share with each individual what will affect them\nUm\nAnnually would be you're meeting and I only share with people who are emotionally mature enough to handle the numbers I don't tell a four year old that you're worth ten million dollars because they will go to kindergarten until it\nOkay and they're not emotionally capable of handling that information our children in our case did not know our wealth as a matter of fact when we finally did unveil it and they were in their early twenties\nIt was shocking to them because they were raised like regular people but I had a lot of wealth in the background and and um so I didn't want to mess up their childhood by them making assumptions about things I didn't need to make assumptions about [noise]\nBut then as we presented to them it was presented as a responsibility not I will do we hit the lottery 'cause I was for me in my house we serve more\nMeaning that you don't know anything you're just managing for God\nAnd that takes a little of the ... who all of it\nSo they need to be emotionally matured and share it with him and we do about once a year [noise] this is the day Ramsey show\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend that quick Churchill checkup then just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage\nGetting better and and we were closer together and we were on the same page and um it's just amazing\nAnd it took us thinking Fifteen months to pay off that that all all of the non word is that a hundred and almost a hundred and ten thousand dollars we sold everything inside that wasn't nailed down in our house and we won\nThe switch flipped with you too it flew up doesn't it yes [laughter] went from a whole host spending stupid all the way over to wide open smart yeah yeah wow that's a true one eighty yeah\nWe just it was like the horses that you talked about in your ... few classes and then we just got together and we're nothing was going to stop us and we ate beans and cheese every day [laughter]\nAnd seeing and cheese we're going out to dinner tonight at a fairly extravagance is good and we're stressed out good no women are days that we've we stay plugged\nInto it

singles and and pray with them and coach him and and it's\nA lot of great stories coming to us on the right path yes\nYes and I wanted to tell you that are\nThirteen year old on started this journey

that uh we put all new ... solid oh floors in her home and we are cash flow to trip to to Japan to see a couple of our grandkids well by the way we have seven that's awesome gaffe so uh\nUh go back to five years ago you call him and say come home was dry this what were the next I don't know I'm going to guess at a period of time three to four months like this marriage is just hanging on\nBy a thread and you say okay but let's try this together and we're not we're not going to spend like what you're spending how how did that next three to four months it looked like from the from the I mean almost gone to we're going to turn and try there's there had it had to be pretty bumpy\nYeah it was it was hard hard to trust her right she spent her whole life\nLiving this way with this chaos with money and in debt and and I did it take you to trust her it probably took a year or so really to to see that hey this is she's she's I'm seeing the action not just the words right\nWell I mean that's a hundred percent but I mean probably within a few weeks you kind of how to raise your eyebrow and go wow she's really doing this I mean you really had to see that that go a little bit a glimpse of holy right away or is it grew yeah trust grew over time well\nIn that moment I got home from your class I was going through my doors for trying to sell ... I mean what can I sell so I sold jewelry I saw I mean you know he was seeing\nGenerating there in front of this year and he's like oh okay and I tell him play it toward the credit card to show you how do I need a business a rival anybody\nAnd just amazing she sold some of my blue jeans for fifty dollars a piece where collecting dust you know\nAnd God has redeemed every bit of that in this marriage and I I got to tell you there's no way you taught that many ... without your all's marriage story causing people's marriage has to be healed yeah we tell our story you know a lot of people come up to you and go\nWow you got real on that and not just that changed my life but you got to hear that powered story\nWe've had the chance to tell her story would do it frequently with a marriage recovered group not just a few but you know anyway and we were we brought along a lot of couples in from a marriage classes in to FDU and vice versa probably a lot of its money issues you know\nWell and there's a a Bible verse proverbs fourteen one that says the wife went down to her house and that foolish women care sit down with her hands and I was at foolish woman and I don't want to you know I don't want

you're a debt free scream three two one\n\n\nDon't really get that\nRadio [laughter] [noise] wow I Believe that [noise]\nJust as good Iran's you show\n[noise]\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to ... or insurance dot com recall eight hundred three five six\nForty two eighty two and

the other way we want you to get rid of your heat lock your home equity line of credit if you have one would you get reverse mortgage if you have one we want you to get out of that because when you don't have any payment you know what you have\nMoney the bar or a slave to the lenders so now we don't recommend home equity lines of credit and bar\nPaul is on Facebook is there a mileage limit your use as a rule of\nThumb one buying a used car\nKnow what I'm trying to determine is is the core worn out to the point is going to give me trouble\nSo the more inexpensive and cheaply made the car is the more the miles would affect it in other words a hundred thousand miles dodge neon would be different than a hundred thousand miles Mercedes\nLike one is used up and the other one is just getting started\nAt that point you know what I'm saying the ... is really tired under the hood of that neon at that point I don't even know they still make a dodge neon but you get my point the cheap little dinky but car I mean you got a hundred thousand miles smart car that's called dom okay\nIt's not called smart anymore so I just give you that example but no chance I Want that thing\nBut if you got a car that's built that say a fire in nicer vehicle uh they're typically well built I mean ... again a Honda Lexus a Mercedes a beamer a Cadillac um\nThe larger body Ford products for building a great product a truck\nA Chevy Truck afford truck with a hundred thousand miles on that one thing about that ah it's got easily another hundred in it may be another three hundred and it depends on how you took care of it and what you were driving and that kind of thing\nUm but I I wouldn't think anything about that at all uh again that was kind of depends on your budget and how nice car you want obviously the least miles or the last used car I bought was a raptor at Nineteen thousand miles on when I bought it I drove until I got about sixty or know got got about fifty something on it\nAnd um so I was a very low my car when I got rid of it the other day and um\nSo you know you just you're looking at your situation to what is the um what is your situation and what can you do but generally speaking the\nThe I'm more of an economy car it is quote unquote the ah the more the miles would have a negative effect on it\nUm because I just I just really don't care because I'm looking for is dependability and how much life is left in it that's a cool question very interesting Dustin is with us in St Louis Hi Dustin how're you\nHey they take 'em off sure man what's up I'm going to high school senior I'm got about three thousand dollars and like I mean the count out donating should I Am that idea of what China than you're going to college here a community college with an H ... program in St Louis and the olive tree\nOkay so you're only going to do two years\nAnd then ending on how the program ... maybe ... service the fibers maturity and I keep them at the community college of either find the right out in the workforce\nYeah you know I Will be true if you get some search some certifications and stuff and not the four year degree might not even be a wise investment I agree with that crime so that's what you want to do you won't be programmer or you want to be an hour or whatever mhm okay uh and the community college is paid for\nAs long as you keep an eye plus yeah um\nYou can invest it\nAh here's the thing I always tell folks at your age I'm I'm much more concerned that you complete all of your educational goals with no debt than I Am whether you have an investment a mutual fund\nLike on a scale of one to pin a nine point nine\nCollege and all your education was the road that so if there was a bump in the road in your little plan you might need some money to finish your schooling and that's much much you Dustin as a better investment than a mutual fund is assuming you're studying something like you're talking about\nBull ... field of study that you can you know really make some good money and and the you know getting that level of education is really gonna cause your income to go be a lot higher than if you didn't have that education so um you know you're the best investment we can make\nMuch better than a mutual fund I like mutual funds and I you know maybe I'll talk about um all the time so if you want to invest some of it into a mutual fund that's fine I Would not put it in a retirement account at this stage\nUh with this amount of money in your situation because again my main goal\nFor you is your friend is for you to get your degree in your field of study whether it's a two year or the certifications and the ... tech field or or whether it's a four year degree my main goal for you is to give you the tools in your belt the educational tools in your belt for you to be able to go live your dream\nWithout any that and that three thousand dollar spin on that is more important than ... and the mutual fund and so if you put it in a mutual fund and you run into a bump don't be afraid to take it out and use it for college if you're going to go that route\nIf you need to thanks for calling open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Mike is in Chicago Hi Mike how are you\nI'm great Dave it's an honor to speak with you\nYou too sir what's up in your world\nFilm my wife and I are currently on baby step forward they can prepare for retirement and we're using the excess in our budget to pay off our mortgage early too and we're both teachers and the state run pension pay nine percent of our gross take home pay into our dilemma is when we have an extra Fifteen Percent on top of that nine percent that we're already contribute\nWe don't have much left over from overheated coloration so when we said the thicker than we're able to save a lot for a mortgage to tolerate though is it okay to do that or am I recommend taking their twenty four\nPercent now the the mandatory amount that you're putting in a ... or you invested in that is that uh uh you choosing an investment for that or as a pension\nGet the answer no options yeah it's it's mandatory its pension and you don't have control of it right and when you leave you can't take it with you correct I have to wait on sixty seven or okay ah and it's nine percent nine percent yeah okay\nSo the the equation is do we put Fifteen on top of that or do we only put six on top of that and that's our dilemma correct correct guy I probably would split the difference\nBecause I don't like the pension we're stuck with it but I don't like it you'd age don't control the options for investing be you don't get to take it with you when you go and the state of Illinois is notoriously poorly run\nThrough its a horribly run state and now we're better than on those guys [laughter] ah yeah no thank you so uh but what I count some of it yeah ... some of it I'm not going to count it as a full nine what if we counted it as a four or five\nIf we Canada's before then that means we need to put it in ten percent right you got a million that you don't have a choice but I'm saying if we because we don't have a lot of faith in it I don't like it but it's there and we'll probably get some of it I mean likelihood as well not predicting the failure of the teachers pension in Illinois\nJust horribly wrong and if it was ever going to fail anywhere it'd be there you know so um that that that's the truth and you know that so a given that let's just let's give it a fifty percent hit or so and just round numbers let's put it in ten percent instead of putting in Fifteen Percent on top\nOr something like that not only celebrate your mortgage a little bit I'm not going to be perfect but it you know it's a little bit more to get that way and you can go that direction so I'm\nI'm you know go do it that that's that's what I Would have a Mac it off\nHey thanks for the call appreciate your joining us this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nAll big John extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life your seat changing these habits is the foundation of our teachings at the smart conferences and I'm excited to announce this fall and winter\nWell there's kind of a couple of things I think first of all you got to believe you know I mean it's it's it's a program to believe in it works follow the program and you can do it um second all it takes a team it can't be an individual you know we're a family of four and it can't just be me doing it which is pretty much what we did in the past I was in charge of the money the budget all that it takes the team in his own as to if you can come together\nIt can happen you know with the with the steps you lay out it's it's not rocket science you know\nOne of the main things that someone needs to do to get out of\nThe budget right there but I mean I think it is amazing how much money just slice of the door that you I don't make enough no it's their you make plenty you spend\nToo much [laughter] well that's true [laughter] literally drew have soil I also think that\nUm they need to focus on why they're doing it though to think further out into the future and um and to recognize that my reason why might not be the exact same reason it hits y but at\nThe end goal that that way in front of us is what we're both gravitating toward ... and go what was your why\nIt's right here I I I like um kids and your family tree I just the legacy I I'm listening to a lot of your stuff and a lot of other um had cats on legacy and love are leaving behind and I think that um if we want to see change like we have to start teaching it\nMm mhm modeling it in teaching it yeah I can change your family tree that's a big reason people will do stuff to change the direction of their family that they would never do for themselves and and it it's a bigger and more noble why\nThan just a I Want to go on vacation someday

O. five got a beginner baby step say but I just feel like I I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like a\nLot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhat's your household income about a hundred a ... gun show can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and stop the studio\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on these rental property as we look for the past couple of years okay if you um\nI mean it it's a matter of choice for you I I personally wouldn't put my kid into bed I Would rather get them through school debt free and then work on the Reynolds is there when they land doesn't sound good\nNo it it does but I just I guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college to hear a lecture years\nWell ... maybe some four or five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income and the retirement fathers kids' college what your cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to\nPay on your mortgage or ... which is in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our Confederate that we should just save up a a a three\nYeah they're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nAre houses tiny but then and then your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about ... we're all about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies\nOkay or the moral fifty 'cause you said to Fifteen yeah yeah and for what is the only ones only twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year well no I was going to feel good about it that much time as do other take out a low\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay I Know there was one in there somewhere to make the maps work All right uh yeah still I'm just going to blink along on those minimum ...\nAnd take care of college without that first once we got college without that then\nWe find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among next knocked my house out 'cause it's a pretty even with the other ones\n... how about first ... back in the oral okay or not\nOh I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay yeah well no so did you get your emergency fund right\nMerge and she found is maybe step three and then by bishop Forrest Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack baby steps four five six in order\nActually three four five six 'cause you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right but it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there was money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list is mortgages Dutch is that so there's still a prioritization even though some of the news is that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before then skipped over three ... three I guess technically\nYou're given five or ...\nYeah yeah yeah and you have any skipped three to yeah [laughter] yeah so yeah you're\nOn our lawyers which you're back in order that's all we did you can do it's good plan man thanks for calling him a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nHi Mr ... it's an honor I talk to you how can I don't think for you [laughter] okay\nUm we had our house currently on the market right now the lifted it in July for two Fifteen [noise] um I Know there's not an ill in our area [noise] um we just lowered it down to one Ninety nine nine [laughter]\nWe've had only one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um [noise] what we're struggling with piers we paid one fifty for the house\nThe average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine good\nLord what is wrong on the area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half million [noise]\nUm and then ... and so that that occasion because it's on lake we're on water on a on a street team but um our military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in a house in Harrisburg proper them no no I'm In like northeast yesterday a near near New York border but so your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes\nDummy through sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in I mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff right\nYou just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than\nA is there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort\nIs or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere they're kinda specializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want to quite pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives or that Jeff not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort\nArea the higher end stuff\nUm [noise] not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a high ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it look gorgeous on line it's not you know these rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it where we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know okay me kid you know we're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices are promising a you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at it\nThey're looking at it on line\nNow they're just workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they're just like the picture flip through and then they realize where it was I walked away\nThey were not client's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours his sold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot yeah\nBut he found a buyer for us to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another well yes\nAnd that's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses\nThat when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house and says gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that\nCan do that this that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel him down to you for the people that don't want to spend\nEnough to be in the other area and and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers and it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area and they and they don't have a visual Myers ones you need to it's a very unique [noise]\nSemi rural ... situation oh I'm Sorry this is the day Ramsey show\nTheft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every\nDay and hundreds of millions of people have had their identity stolen sometimes multiple times that's crazy now I've seen first hand when people are stressed and freaked out when they become an identity theft\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nSimply wasn't that way on one of\nThose ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to de France ha ha ha or out of heart beginning so I mean I'm\n... what's your all income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the\nForce anyone would you like it was really difficult to to give out some things that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that ... but it also kind of boils down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show than and said we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart has you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see them you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's a beach with the legs that kinda stuff\nWith the income you've got and no debt you can do anything you wanted to them and you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even anywhere near as expensive as those houses are so it was right it's um you know you are your freed up to still have incredible\nUh family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say interesting very interesting\nSo um so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole deck is um [noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off we were able to pay off the home that we live and mhm\nSo we we use the cash derived from that ... plus cash flow and some savings to pay for our home that we live and okay so it was just three property ... yeah that's where I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt which operates okay

this income you got to be alone that up so um\nHow Sheffield feels great I mean I'm you know I'm I'm I'm kinda\nTo the point of a second guessing even even having so much as our network tied up in a house ... um so but it feels great you know it's it's a it's a first step in a journey\nYeah yeah well I get give yourself a couple of years to think on that one you know where to go you're in great
