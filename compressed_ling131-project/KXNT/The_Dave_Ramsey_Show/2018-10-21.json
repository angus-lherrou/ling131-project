the time\nThe STDs part that crosses the line\nI felt terrible\nYeah that crosses the line matter of fact legally it crosses the line it's because it's a libel per se\nIn other words a libel per se means you're you don't have to prove anything it's by law liable and it goes back to common law goes back to a oh it's fantastic law goes back hundreds and hundreds of years English common law and the rules were liable per se\nIs a accusing a business person of dishonest business practices um the\nHome that's one of them uh uh uh uh attacking a women's virginity a was another one that one isn't

forcefully matter of fact you say that a little bit to forcefully if you really want to know into quickly if you know what I'm Talking about ... percent protest too much\nOkay I'll forget our own uh

Sorry Dave I Apologize oh that you and that's my fault hello ... good morning that already has her\nI have a a a file a personal bankruptcy which will be discharged are completely next September in the meantime I'm In the middle of a cash out refinance on my personal resident\nA it's almost at the end and so we're on a timeline a title search revealed that there is a second mortgage owed by a large bank or the title company will not fund the ... left that second is paid off outside of the re fi\nAh contacted the bank they said there was twenty five thousand note but they would settle for ten I don't know anything about this loan I've never paid on it I asked him to send me the records of the contract they said the records don't go back that far\nHow do they know you all the money\nThat was my question to them but it showed up on the credit report right well that could be an era that could be an error\nI I understand that but they won't they won't provide any croquet alone in the meantime the the ... is being yeah yeah\nAll right so I I think at this point I Would I Would do is get a lawyer letter over to them\nAnd if it turns out that they don't have any proof that you all the money is just hey you all was the money I Am because there is a letter or someplace there's some indication we have no backup what you're doing is a illegally interfering with my ability to get re fi\nAh and ah there is some are there some liability there\nOr understand that in the meantime the the locked in rates are going to\nKnow your there's no question now rates are are are exploding oh there is no issue about it at all so you want to work with your lender although the lender is going to do everything now that interest rates are so high would love to get you out of a locked in rage or maybe a they still want your business who the hell knows at this point\nAnd that because I don't know the anticipated the rates going up as quickly as they have been going on in the last few weeks and\nSo you work with them but this is where I I think you have to threaten or the banks saying you're holding up uh my rage uh which is locked in\nSo you work with them but this is where I think you have to threaten or the banks saying you are holding up uh my rage or which is locked in interest rates are now higher there some damages their and die you just you can't do that without proof but we don't have the records\nWell then how do I do yoga money well because you do I do\n[noise] so that's why a letter from a lawyer and making a couple of demands would help\nIt would there be any advantage to waiting until the next September when the bankruptcy discharges to get a just a standard or a conventional\nEarly on that well it's put your interest rates ... what are they are two points higher yeah\nOr you have to you don't want to wave your rights on this one Gulf War I get the letter a and nail the bank if you can wow right I've ever heard of that happening and and do just\nThat we're always money [noise] the bank [noise] maybe there's a letter there is there's no proof the problem [noise] they say is handling the law [noise]\n\nThere's nothing small about your

it out until you are and and then here's your fine and uh we're going to keep on charging however they made it untenable for you to on the other side is that you wanted to put it in and they they made it impossible for you to even\nUh even make an application and there it is in their ... by the way that there's the court case\nOkay uh you have to ... ... what I Would do is have a conversation with the attorney that represents the board and every every board of directors a H every ... has an attorney who represents a that represents them and just have a conversation and say hey you know the board made it impossible to management company when you call me back\nWhat am I supposed to do well what you're supposed to do is just keep on trying and trying and trying and at some point I'll tell you legally what should happen even though it's the biggest pain in the ass you go to the point where they make an untenable and then you get a court order allowing you to do that because they made it untenable but that's\nWay down the line so you kind of early on now it's a question of\nA what a pain in the asked the board is they're going to say hey we set up a time when we set up a date you

T. sessions and um he seemed to be okay\nAnd then uh the company the insurance company from the other party said hey look we'll pay for your medical costs and we'll throw in a a five hundred dollar bone pain and suffering mound pointed out my son is having recurring nightmares and he's going to college out of state so the insurance company wants to settle on trying to figure out well you know do I take 'em to small claims\nNo no no you don't take them small claims court uh your uh first of all your\nSon's a case obviously is still open because you haven't sign or symptom money on behalf of your son 'cause you have to guard emit light I'm and I'm assuming you did none of that correct\nThat's correct or not he is he is more of an Eighteen okay so it still is not settled against him\nThat's correct All right yes a recurring nightmares is no small thing if a if it's going to be chronic and if you've been connected to that accident so your problem is where your challenge not your problem is connecting his nightmares\nTo the accident and that you and they were going to have to deal with the shrink uh right there is no way that you\nCan say well in my opinion well yeah ... where did you go to a psychology school where's your memory they held the Amish therapy have you done\nSo it's a question of going to shrink and there could be some sustain a substantial money uh involved\nThere I mean we had very similar case uh with my children are when are we sent them and it wasn't in a car accident but we sent them to a psychologist for certain problems they had and it turned out their entire psychological problems was due to the fact they're my kids\nAre and ah you know [laughter] there's not much we can do about that but connecting the two is the challenge then then you start talking it's going to be a lot more than small claims from my friend oh really okay yeah yeah it's a personal injury case but they're going to tell you you you got to back up the the connection\nDo you think I should hook up with a ... a personal injury\nOr anyone I Would yeah okay I certainly just starting to yeah I certainly started all ah for sure\nBetty Hi Betty [noise]\nYes I have a large pine tree [laughter] that is hanging over in my yard and the ... the house next door with a ... I don't know who owns it but there's several people living in it because of the four or five cars I see out front\nOkay well they're probably they're probably squatters and her\nWay I can yeah I'm tacked or get a hold of somebody yeah Betty how old are you\n\n... how old are you ready Ninety One or you've really yes God you don't sound to me over Ninety Oh thank you all\nNow very yes and so you want to do this fairly quickly before you die and you're saying that All right so bad that right yeah so\nGood for you reaches humor aren't so bad\nAnd so you want to do this fairly quickly before you die I understand that [laughter] All right so bad that right yeah so good for you reaches humor All right so Betty or the trick is finding out who owns the property and that that you can just pull title and it could be the bank or someone owns that property\nIt with a rape or understand so therefore the bank has it\nWhich is exactly what you want the bank to own it because then you contact or the bank and say hey\nClean this up\nGet rid of a though that hanging do those hanging branches now when I Would do is you've got to do it anyway at some point and a is there a danger your property I mean is there a wall that so being affected\nAnd then there's the fence between the two proper and they are and I understand I've been here for years and I understand it's a common than\nAll right well I that doesn't matter even if it's common fence or they're responsible for any uh trees ranch is hanging over your property so here's what I Would do I get a bed\nAnd find out how much is going to cost if it were me I Do it myself I pay for it and then turn around and do those people but doesn't necessarily have to be that way I your strict as simply finding out who owns it and you can use it pulled title on that that's easy uh that's just a in an Internet search 'cause he's raw public documents\nAnd then you contact the owner now you hope it's the bank because if it's still in the name of the previous owner ...\nThey're going to tell you to go pounds than they don't care I mean they're losing everything anyway I mean the worst what happens if you get a judgment against them for let's say three hundred dollars okay just get in line because we've lost our house but he didn't our credit is like already\n[noise] their their distaste and their son took off\nA ... then you have to find out who owns a property 'cause that's where you going to go or you just pay for it and just suck it up I mean the people that are squatting next door they don't have any responsibility or how bad is your problem with this\nWell it it to the point I haven't done I hadn't said anything about it 'cause I don't see anybody coming in and out but it it is a hanging over at least half\nIraqi are it's a lot how much do you think it's going to cost to clean up\nWell I think it's quite large and the pine needles are about ... inches long\nAgo yeah All right so you've got an issue I so I get a bad\nAnd I don't know how ... how you doing for money are you living tape for oh good All right because then the next question was going to be I like are you living in a dumpster and is it nice and clean and uh so that's not the case I Would just pay for it and just have it done and then find out who owns the property and just send the bill\nOh okay that's and then uh it's right in the same small claims court as I said if the bank owns that don't clean it up because that's just what they do I mean they're\nTrying to sell the house and they don't want any liability and ah [noise] they're they're pretty good about that especially if you're talking a small potatoes two hundred dollars [noise] this is handle on the law [noise]\n\n\nAre you considering a safe to secure your valuables or firearms let's face it shapes are not very attractive they usually end up getting stuck in the garage to run a closet\nOh no matter of fact even if there were negative and you give your name too do you give the hotel name out the what you can't do is make stuff up in a negative way this defamation me or you can tell I'm Wondering we had\nNo no go ahead yourself\nAlright so uh let's say a year or accusing the hotel and having bedbugs in your story and you name the hotel uh you know I don't want to name any names but Hilton Marian Wright Wyndham let's just go through the names incidentally what was the name of the hotel\nOr can they want to say that on the air bill\nWhy they don't know who you are\nAh well actually truthfully I'm not sure if I can imagine are faring of a it's been it's been a few years\nYeah okay fair enough by the way they're ... they couldn't go after you because uh there is a uh uh just to let you know you've heard of the attorney client privilege there is a there is a hotel talk show privilege just recognized under the law so they could not have to think what laws that one thing that you\nI don't like the way you can't remember which hotel I don't have it here in front of me uh when I'm sure it's there no the point is is that let's say there was a horrible experience and you're a disparaging the hotel if it's true but ah you know what there is no defense there is no such thing as ...\nExperience and you're a disparaging the hotel if it's true but\nAh you know what there is no defense there is no such thing as defamation to the truth is an absolute defense by the way they're not going to go after you if you say OK their bed bugs and the people were horrible and if you're talking about a non disparaging remark if you're talking about something that's positive that happens\nOr not only is there no disparage may not only is there in the lawsuit for defamation 'cause it's not defamation or they're getting a commercial\nYeah that was kinda might take down your way out what what kind of book to write\nWell the first book with the travel experience a that was done and sort of a novelist ...\nLike in in real time you know strangely enough I probably didn't read it how do you do well we didn't do because we we put it on hold okay who's worried about legal as I understand don't really know wondering okay you're very lawyer\nUnderstand don't you don't have to worry about that uh because uh the fact that it hasn't been published yet there is not going to be a whole lot of difference when you publish it I uh-huh terms of sales okay what's your next book that you're working on okay\nThe the second one uh this is a book about a um a period of time in my life I guess you could call it a memoir\nThat takes place in Mexico ahah and\nPart of it involves a very well known cancer clinic and Mexico okay\nAnd there was an extremely negative scenario involved with this weather it's very famous cancer clinic and what I did and the second book is I changed the name of the hospital and all the doctors and and uh ... made it as unrecognizable\nCould then you're fine I to do anything to do there's okay here's a little detail they're getting long had part of\nMexico where it is it's the only cancer clinic and it's very well know\nAlright so big deal in the meantime here is ... I'm going to give you a reality check okay let's say there's defamation right ah and ah there's a it didn't happen there's legitimate you're giving a ... you are shooting vaccinating facts that\nAre are not true so now you they have a case to things have to happen number one ah people have to give a rat's about what happened to you and they don't\nWrite so uh I I wouldn't worry 'cause all three people going to read the book uh it really doesn't matter a number two they're going to be three people going to read the book uh they're never going to hear about it and if they do they're not suing you so don't worry about it enjoy yourself defame them\nI just have a time of your life couple of rules make sure it's a that you don't make up the facts and number two is as often as possible uh make it your opinion\nOkay for example a it is my opinion that when they operate on me uh they took out my diaphragm but that Sean opinion\nI really don't know if they don't believe you can have died from well there you are okay thanks for the call is handle on the law you socked eight forty AM Che accent [noise]\n\n\nThe seventh annual full flooring yard sales going on now with incredible deals lumber liquidators we've got hundreds of floors on sale up to fifty percent off in stock and ready to go see big on waterproof floors all on sale from just thirty nine cents skin\nWill look limited flooring all on sale up to forty percent off\nFree finished hardwood and bamboo starting at Ninety nine cents plus special financing stop\nYour local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today is nothing small\nIn a sense plus special financing stop by your local lumber liquidators store or visit lumber liquidators dot com today\nThere's nothing small and now you're making your passion your hours your reputation among huge your partnership even\nWith the technology in Niger and you'll get the ... and ... and one on one partnership to help your business ground because with a reliable down ... and ... you can focus on what matters most to getting business down\nA Devon Devon die down to speak with an advisor today [noise] eight seven seven by down [noise]\nAre you putting your retirement savings in a four O. one K.
