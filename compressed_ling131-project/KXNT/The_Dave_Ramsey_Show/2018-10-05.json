...\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your world\nSo recently this week uh found out that uh my wife had kinda racked up about forty can a credit card debt behind the scenes of a kind of those slap to the face you know I kind of found out this week with his last weekend\nSo it's pretty pretty tough to swallow\nMm So she was hiding it from you\nYeah I'm ... and I you know I Can't just blame her I mean I I got to take some credit because I never kind of went and looked and kind of a\nPaid any attention and this is the second times about two and a half years ago kind of the same thing and I kind of laid out a budget and then kind of slipped away from that budget and I think it was it just kind of roll back into it I assume that everything was going okay but it just kind of wasn't\nOkay so you gave her a all of the responsibility of handling the money and you weren't involved in the money\nA hundred percent okay yeah yeah it is your fault you know yeah um\nAnd it's her fault but basically she was out of control didn't know what to do and uh just borrowed her way\nInto a mess and neither one of you had your head and the game correct okay\nSo ah are you already to stop the cycle I can show you how\nYeah a hundred percent and as a this this week and so there's a I don't want to say more to the the problem with that kind of a solution but\nA on Wednesday this week I got a I received it twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance check that I haven't put in the bank yet because I wanted to wait till I spoke with you to see how I or go attack us I don't want to I don't want to do any other dumb things I Want to continue I Want to start from scratch off the bat but I got to do it the right way\nOkay well let me ask you this then I'm it sounds like you're taking ownership for having kind of a dump this on your wife and abandon her or is she taking ownership for the shame the fact she was ashamed and so she hid this from you because she didn't know what to do but she knew she was screwing it up\nIntend ti used talk gate forty AM Jay you actually in the [noise]\nIs very interesting topic this topic of financial infidelity redwood magazine into the service of thirty eight percent of you lie to your spouse about money [noise]\nWow\nAnd you wonder why you're marriages in topping out is uh Dawson [noise]\nNow I mean it can be little white lies the target bags under the bed Snickers snake or write a or it can be big time credit card debt it can be one of you is running a business and is running up debt down at the business and not telling your spouse\nBecause you're trying to live your dream and it's turning into a nightmare\n\nLet me just kinda clarify this for you there is no positive effect to your marriage when you lie to your spouse\n[laughter]\nWas that helpful you didn't already know that did you [laughter] well I'm trying to avoid it by ear you're all you're doing the cooking it up it's going to be a bigger fight once it cooks up [laughter] you might as well have a smaller fires quickly so\nHere's the thing if you're afraid to discuss with your spouse a purchase or a financial issue that you want to discuss that is not a financial problem that is a relationship problem\n\nNow I got to tell you there's times I I mean I I have a ton of money I'm a multi millionaires times though I think I Want to buy something and I'm also down talk Sharon hey I Want to buy this toy\nI'm going to buy another gun she's like you don't mean that again you have too many guns already\nPeople already would think you were crazy if they know what I mean under at I collect guns by the way so yeah if it ever comes out you know they're they're going to find out that I was like one of those crazy guys or something but I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another boat you don't need another ...\nAll those crazy guys or something but I'm not but I I collect okay I collect so you know you don't need another car you don't need another ... you don't need another inner tube to pull behind the bar actually collect those I got too much too many like toys right ah for the grandkids and for the kids to play on\nAnd so you know I I get ready to buy it toy and it's it's not it doesn't even show up on our\nBut I still have to have this moment and I go I I actually got to make sure I talked to share and about this she gets ready to buy purses too expensive which is one of the few things that she buys this too expensive\nBut like she says one of those purses is equal to\nOne of those guns [laughter] uh well maybe maybe two guns [laughter] but uh you know isn't it funny how as adults that have the money even\nWhere there is not a stress on the finances have it a little bit of a dread about talking to each other so you really have to push yourself and make yourself and Rachel talks about this in her book love your life not there's one of the seven habits just talk about money even when it's hard and it's almost always hard\nTo talk about it keep it clean and\nIf your spouse is hiding money from you it generally does fall under one of three areas one is you've got a broken relationship and they are intimidated by you\nTo the spouse is an arrogant\nRebellious immature prints are princes that just wants to do whatever they want to do with their lips stuck out and they don't like being told no spoiled child and the grownup body and goes and buys whatever they want to buy but no that is wrong so they hide it from you\nMost often we find hidden that though it's the what the guy was on the last call\nOne of the spouses has been given all of the responsibility all of the weight of all of the decision making isn't doing the money handling well ends up running into debt because they're not doing a good job with it and now the shame is multiplied and its shame based hiding its guilty\nCondemnation based hiding so they're hiding it 'cause they don't they're they're ashamed that they haven't done a good job of handling the money\nIn which case if that's your spouse you you are partially responsible just like that guy said\nHe was he owned it because he should have been more involved you shouldn't have dumped this on his wife and you shouldn't dump it all on your husband\n\nYou shouldn't dump it all on either one of your both of you should be involved and I want to be again can carry that ministry of weight wants all the decisions are made but everybody ought to know where every dollar is going\nPretty simple stuff\nSo you probably never heard the story but I actually was the guy who would almost been on Oprah more than anybody\nOprah called like five six times their producers did and would tease us like we could get on I'd been on every other show back in the day you know I've been on a sixty minutes I had been on Larry King remember Larry King was on the air and Sally Jessie Raphael you remember her with a red glasses you know all that I've been on all these different shows\nYou know everything out there ... except I couldn't get on Oprah and they would call and teases so finally they call and we get our Oprah parents and it was three different families on Oprah and I was supposed to advise them in their trouble on Oprah and the very first family\nOf course I knew what I was getting into and the families knew what they were getting into a sort of and um the very first couple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong [laughter]\nCouple I'm sitting up there are getting an argument with Oprah\nWhy would I Do that because Oprah was wrong\n[laughter]\nIs what happened so here's the deal the wife had run up like Seventy thousand dollars worth of debt and her husband had no idea\nAnd uh\nI had told the producers I said was partially his fault because he's not involved in his wife's life enough he's not loving his wife enough to even know what's going on in her life enough that she can run up Seventy eight thousand dollars if she unless she's just like a psychopath and her level of deception\nThis guy hadn't got he he doesn't know what's going on under his own roof he's freaking clueless when his relationship\nAnd so Oprah's reading the script and she's like and Dave you say that it's partially spoiled and he owes or an apology I don't think I agree with that and I said well you would be wrong he does or an apology cause he hasn't been walking with his wife to the point she runs up Seventy eight thousand or with a bat and he don't even know what the flips going on under his own roads\nAnd she's like well hey delegated to her as Oprah this is not a business you don't delegate stuff to your spouse\nAnd just dump it on them and even if you're delegated in business you would always inspect what you expect you would never just walk away and hope it happened you wouldn't know what's going on in business and besides that this is a marriage is not a joint venture God did not say and now you are a joint venture\nHe said and now you are one and these two are not one they're not on the same page and so\nYou know the poor lady sitting there crying because she so ashamed and overwhelmed and the guys angry 'cause he's finding out he got a grand and debt that he didn't know he hadn't oh man they looked like a Jerry ... Springer episode or something and um you know and I'm a I'm Stan I'm making him apologized to her for not being a good husband\nBecause of your wife can run up your husband can run up a hundred thousand dollars in debt and you have no idea what's going on you have chosen to not be involved in your own spouse's life or their or psychopathic liar\nOne of the two but most of the time but you just did you just dumping on them\nAnd then and then you cry because they didn't do it right after you'd dumped it on them and walked away enclosed your eyes and what we'll do the ... well you know you thought but you didn't even care enough to get involved\nIn what was going on and so Oprah's all upset with Dave because Oprah was wrong [laughter] didn't work out well the rest of the show what we got through it [laughter] so here's the rule of thumb then\nWe see couples who have a good marriage have been married ten years or Fifteen Years or Twenty years\nSit down and start doing a basic budget together we're every dollar has an assignment every dollar has a mission every dollar as a name before the month begins on paper on purpose every month before the month against a unique budget it takes about ten minutes\nOnce you've been doing it a while but it takes about three months of doing it to get really on the same page and get a rhythm going\nWe see couples that agree on their spending before the month begins on paper on purpose increased their level of communication\nTenfold increase their level of cooperation tenfold\nIncrease their empathy for each other for the stress the other one's been carrying that they didn't even realize tenfold [noise] they began to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof ... you'll feel like you've got to\nAs tenfold they begin to agree on their goals and their productivity with their money goes through the roof you'll feel like you've got a raise when you learn through this together\nOn paper on purpose before the month begins give every dollar a name that's why we named the world's best budgeting software every dollar the best that for your phone every dollar of every dollar to name [noise] and\n\nThat you know there are more than two million real estate agents in this country\nUm you know I think one of the things that you say constantly and I really like it you say that you know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God liquid out and said hey I can trust that one and you know I think that's\nAnd I really like it you say that you know when you decide to get smart with your money is kind of like God look down and said hey I can trust that one\nAnd you know I think that's something that kind of happened was with us 'cause you know a lot of different opportunities started coming our way in terms of just income and and just of course a lot of increases came our way as well and so God just begin opening those doors than we were able to pay off with a much quicker radio a lot quicker than we thought because\nLike Virginia even mentioned in the beginning it was definitely very overwhelming and then just looking at all the student loans you thought how are we going to pay this off\nHow we're going to get at home do all these different things for the family but um you know ... dollars at our side and and of course you know he was able to open up those doors for us to get on the same page and be able to pay off this and that was pretty good for\nYou know how how do you explain to other people will do I know I Know what the answer is but\nHow do you explain to other people the level of intensity is required 'cause you guys I mean it was not panic but you were focused to the point that you sacrifice so deeply that normal people looking at you all had to think you lost your mind I mean you guys were on your game all\nYeah I don't know where do you get that fire from was it desperation\n[laughter] yeah I think it was a ... mostly that living with a student loan was unacceptable for us then and we just had made the decision and our heart that um we weren't going to do that and so I had and we had just individuals that kind of had the perspective that I'm living with a student loan was um\nYou know and it was normal you know it was just a mediocrity and that was just a part of life and Sallie Mae's going to be a room mate for life\nRight by God so people you know are some responses that we got where like you know you don't need to do that or you know that you could fit this into your life that we had just made the decision like you know art student loan was just so astronomical that we couldn't live with it\nAnd so and we were really we were ready and willing to do I'm told to do those zero budget you know there's Iraq's and budget everything out and every dollar hadn't assignment and every extra dollar went to a student loan so we were making payments\nLike in the sand making payments to have him do a month\nRight we have to have a big shovel and so we put everything we had towards it and we had like zero last for like just everyday living like eating out\nGoing shopping um socializing entertainment like that did not meet our budget line item and not for our budget and so and you know the sacrifice was overwhelming and they can and the like it was really a marathon to the degree that it was extremely painful to live two and two years bike and that lifestyle you know\nBut and I would have to say like during those times like prayer was everything like I really had to say I really had to praise through and just the frustration of that type of lifestyle and really be uplifted in spirit um\nTo really be focused and to maintain that lifestyle and you know and then he had countless hours worked ... hours like twelve fourteen sixteen hour days or weeks then months out of time um but he was just very focused and just stay tired\nStaying in prior to really I'm kind of meet the marathon that we were I'm experiencing\nAnd those are the pains of it was it worth it yeah I don't know you're completely free yeah good\nYeah I Know what else should get out of this is like when you climb a wall that's that tall you comical avoid going we can free can do anything [laughter] yeah I mean\n... me but I mean we can do anything I was in the first twenty four months of your marriage of your marriage\n[laughter] yeah I mean\nThere are ... strengthens me but I mean we can do anything I was in the first twenty four months of your marriage of your married life you know you didn't sit on the on the couch and watch Oprah reruns and wine is your thumb you went out killed at drug at home and paid off four hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars a day or so impressive\n[laughter] that's pretty cool we got a copy of Chris ... book for your returns bard we want that to be the next chapter in your story and it definitely will be outrageously generous and of course millionaires along the way\nSo you're right on track to do all of that I'm so proud of you guys I Know your family's in I don't know your Patrick proud of you\nAnd make sure you tell Robert this story you want to hear this yeah\nYou know what he wants to hear this I'm telling you I Love it All right guys way to go All right it's\nTrue 'cause in Virginia Dallas texas for a hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars paid off in twenty four months making a hundred and a three hundred counted down let's Sarah debt for\nThree to one to be the gory were [noise]\n[noise] don't you tell me 'cause I don't know too many of those two rock stars\nUsed wish you were them man that's amazing\nWell on you guys well done either some of every generation that decided to be losers not those two ... and not the ones I get some meat and you know that's an interesting thing you know what they did they just decided [noise] they decided this is overwhelming it's scary and we're going to do something about it so\nWhat are you willing to do you decide you're going to do something about it says your day baby just as the Dave Ramsey show [noise]\n\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family has the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life\nInsurance just go to ... or insurance dot com recall eight hundred three five six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is be the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and that put you on course\nFor better things ahead\nHey Sean

I Love that book too and one of the things I grass from reading that book and other books is is\nThere is a difference between forgiveness and reconciliation\nThose of us that are wise in emotional maturity spiritual maturity\nAnd those of us that are Christians are called to forgive when you forgive you set yourself free from the bondage of the fence\nYou're offended and when you forgive when you're a victim and you forgive you're not setting the victim eyes are free you're setting you yourself free\nYou can forgive someone and not be reconciled to them\nYoung lady called a minute ago and was trying to figure out how to should she reconnect with a brother in law she's having trouble reconnecting her brother in law after he had affairs and everything else and he supposedly come clean for the last two years\nHis wife has forgiven him and taking him back and been reconciled to him but not the sister in law she doesn't won't be around it so here's the question at what point for\nSomeone's misdeeds do you forgive them and then at what point are you reconciled to them they're different\nGuy\nSomeone rapes you what a horrible grotesque violent unbelievably violent crime I Can't imagine can't imagine going to say something like that\nBut to not forgive them of eventually as you begin to heal from your emotional scars\nIs to not set yourself free from that very difficult to do I'm not saying it's easy but when you when you do for give them you set them free but you would not be reconciled ever to someone who ... meaning you wouldn't go on a date with them you know so much Steve\nBe reconciled ever to someone who rage meaning you wouldn't go on a date with them you know someone steals your wallet\nYou can forgive them but you're not gonna you know leave your wallet with them later your new wallet for them to watch over your money you wouldn't be reconciled with them probably ever in that situation\nBut in the case of that young woman she was not personally wrong her\nYou know the guy's wife issue was wrong right and uh her sister in law was wrong or brother in law heroin or how it worked\nOut his brother in law but anyway as it was ... I guess her husband's family is well understood it but anyway the the lady that do the wife is who was wrong to she forgave animals reconciled to the husband as he supposedly is putting his life\nBy getting out of the everybody's life back together I don't know the guy you don't know the guy well once you knew that you can always do it well you know people that I haven't done it can always do it you know any one of you listening is capable of adulterous affairs\n\nEveryone's capable of that and if you think you're not capable of it you're just about to have one I mean really that's just ridiculous so at what point do you forgive someone when they've done something wrong at a distance\nLike that\nI can forgive him and you know I Hope he's turned it around and I'm not going to sit around and reading my hands and be mad at him and worried about him I Hope he's turned it around I Hope he doesn't hurt her again his wife\nI'm I can I can do that now at what point am I going to trust this guy again that is what reconciliation is at what point am I going to trust that his conversion his turnaround is real\nSee we run into this all the time with her coaching because one spouse lies to the other one about money what we call financial infidelity\nYour husband your wife lied to you and ran up a bunch of credit cards and you didn't even know it it's hard to trust them again after that\nAnd if you're going to stay married you're pretty well instantaneously\nGonna have to sit down and go okay I forgive you but I'm not necessarily going to be reconciled who you financially\nI'm a I'm going to watch over your shoulder on everything that's going on or we have a couple of come in and the guy is ... is a you know he he's a been found to be a gambling addict which happens like every week\n\nFootball betting is destroying families finance is on the ...\nSo he comes in he discovered she's discovered he's a abetting addict an online betting addict the gambling addict and now he's gotten treatment he's in gamblers anonymous and he's seeing his pastor and he's seeing a a counselor and he's doing everything he supposed to do does that mean she just turns over the checkbook to him and let him go run havoc again no\nNo it's a matter of fact we recommend that when someone's recovering from an addiction like that that that may not have control of their not have any access to money for a while\nUntil trust us rebuild overtime but ten years later ... should be rebuilt ten months later it shouldn't be better than it is now two years later or should we better than that it should per aggressively rebuild trust\nAnd so if ten years later you you're still or you know you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again\nAnd so if ten years later you\nYou're still or you know you you have not bet on a football game again you've not lost any money gambling again or you trustworthy at that point yeah as much as anybody else's and so we're\nNot going to treat you like you have no ability to handle money the rest of your life but for the short term yeah we're taking all access to money away from Utah you prove that you can have a little bit\nAbsolutely but then gradually trust his rebuilt and overtime it's rebuilt\nIf you cannot when someone has\nOn something like we're talking about here ... ... ... has not when when someone has demonstrated over an extended period of time that they're not\nEntering into the negative behavior and you can't forgive them and you can't begin to trust them in that area then it starts to be on you and two years clean if the guy's clean from his double\nLife adult for survivors or whatever he was doing on addiction whatever it was sound like it was all of that\nTwo years is a long time you should be some level of trust rebuilt assuming it's all real now if there's indicators is not real\nStill looks like he's sneaking around if he's still got behaviors that make everybody question whether there's a real then that's different but I'm assuming this cash right and if he's straight for two years than\nYou know it starts to be your problem if you can't begin to trust at that point especially given that his wife already\nShe might just be an enabler she might be\nShe might be code have been and that could be what's going on could be\nThat he's cleaned up his life and you're just suffered you can't forgive\nThe that's the difference there's a difference in forgiveness and reconciliation they generally happen at different times generally forgiveness should come faster than reconciliation of our pet a dog and it provides me forgive the dog\nThe dog in one\nWhen I got to be reconciled whether this is that Iran's Asia [noise]\n\n\nI get asked all the time

says my wife and I are in baby step to those there'll be that a new that means are getting out of debt everything but their house\nShould be done in a year we're entering what looks to be a lengthy and intense custody battle with my ex wife\nWe have to hire an attorney and it looks like he'll be expensive should pause baby step to to pay for this or should we hold our falling the paperwork until we have the debt paid off\nUm\nWell the fact that you asked if you should hold off filing the paperwork tells me that that is an option [noise] see I don't know what is going on with this custody battle\nAnd all kinds of different things can go on there if I thought my child was in danger if I thought there was a predator a that my ex was marrying or I thought uh some real extreme thing than I'm going to cause the baby step\nAnd we're going to take care of the game that's primary\nBut the fact that you mention in your email that we could wait tells me that this is more like you are aggravated with her\nWhich would be like college standard operating procedure right so um if if the child is not in danger and is not is not harmed\nBy you waiting a year yeah I'd get out of debt before I entered a lengthy custody battle because it'll put you in a stronger position to enter that battle you'll have the cash flow to just stay in the game 'cause most of the time when you get into something like that the first one that runs out of cash as we lose is not the first one was right\nAnd so you gotta yeah war chest man and um\nIf delaying it until your debt free one year from now is a is a ...\nDish and so you know I don't know what's going on so I Can't tell but ... that's a couple of different ways of looking at it Chris is with us in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Chris how are you\nI'm doing great how are you better than I deserve what's up\nGood good to hear um I have a quick question my brother and I are are harder than the small business and I'm Around last year my wife uncle had a had a sign up for what's called a ... an insurance policy\nNow I'm a little ignorant to as to what it is but he explained to me that it that it protects my wife and me then she became my benefits here but in the event than anything happen to me she kind of get my portion of the business but it also worked as a retirement fund type of thing so I'm kinda just calling to see what\nWhat your opinion is of that type of policy and if it's necessary or ... or what I what I should do\n... team in is what it's doing it's not a type of policy so let's separate the two things sold you a piece of crap called a whole live life insurance policy because it has built it is okay has a built in savings program\nOkay so we're going to cancel the stupid policy right key man simply means it's typically used in in a situation like you were in in business uh by cell agreement and the way it would work is that uh you you said you're in business with who your brother\nMy brother okay and so uh let's say you died the life insurance on you would go to him giving him the money to buy your share of the business\nFrom your wife okay because he doesn't want to be a partner with your wife\nOr not because he ate your wife maybe because you had your wife but not because he had your wife but more likely because she didn't want to be in the business right so it will give him the money and you do it in reverse as well he needs to buy a policy on him that goes to you but it's stated in the partner\nShould have the same thing that we're both okay so you're both going to cancel this grabbing over what was going to get out we bought a piece of crap yeah you're going to buy term\nLife insurance little do the same thing for about a nickel on the dollar for what you're seeing now\nOkay what's the face of milder that's what's the face of Memphis given to him if you die or her\nUm I have to I'd have to double check I don't I don't remember what we signed up for like I said it was it says well over a year ago okay I'm In the business has just been putting in you know paying their\nPremiums yeah the premium I suppose as you know like I said you know have articles are are you in L. L. C. or are you a general partnership\nOr an escort escort okay do you have articles of incorporation that defined what happens in the event of death\nUm I'm not sure if it finally happened to me then a dad and now I'm not I don't know\nYou need to have a what's called a by cell\nAgreement okay\nAnd it's funded by inexpensive term life insurance\nTerm okay trivia with attorney or certain if there's a whole like all the\n... whole lives as the only one that has a retirement benefit later okay I Know that means it as a savings element and that means it's twenty times more expensive for the same amount of insurance\nRight now you got me he's like oh and you're you know when you're sixty this is what are they catch the cash value will be yeah yeah and you know an ... number at the end and I'm like okay\nSo here's the thing if you spend one acts instead of twenty X. two accomplished your business goal of being able to buy out the widow of the one that there's a lot that died right uh that's the business go and you spend one acts of doing that you use the other Nineteen next to invest and you'll have a whole lot more money than you would have had inside this piece of crap policy that he bought and sold\nYou okay that's the problem highlight life insurance has a horrible\nLoaded with fees and uh if you die they do not pay you the money that's in savings that you pay the extra create they only pay the face value\nAnd so the ... the money that you're playing for the money that you're paying extra for to create savings is all being done poorly that's the problem here\nI got a guy that makes sense yeah I'm In a minute or so I you know pet six months I've kinda been grinding Mickey and my wife and I are on baby step to cool I'm now going to want to cash out that whatever it is in the whole like oh yeah yeah and then you go with the term policy\nOr you get turned policy in place first case she died while the ball right an issue but once it's in place and you cancel the garbage policy but again you're going to save so much money doing this and you can accomplish the goal and it's going to help clean up your escort\nCorporate documents by having your attorney or it's not it's a one page thing but it's yeah ... ... and\nThen you need to cover that with all the four of you shut down the spouses and go okay if he dies I'm going to be getting money to buy you\nOut sister in law OK okay you're going to be out of the business that's our thing and um and if I die my wife's going to be out of business because my brother is going to buy her out and is going to have the money to do that from life insurance\nFrom that are okay from this new term policy\nAnd it it has stated that that money has to be used for that\nFor that specific bought for the buyout yeah yeah ...\nThat's the by cell agreement very standard stuff in a situation like you're in\nOkay awesome I really appreciate your health\nThank you brother thanks for calling him open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump in we'll talk about your life and your money John is on Facebook what do you think of group life insurance is is a\nLife insurance today um group life insurance means that you're buying life insurance through your company that's what you would have to I mean by that that's the only type of group life insurance that is because you can't buy life insurance on the dark roof you buy a large insurance on individuals you could be it can be furnished who you through your company\nAs a benefit and or you could buy it as a part of your group health insurance benefits package or life insurance benefits package um\nI it's okay to buy that it's usually if you are buying it you know if it's free of your employers furnishing it frees free shut up okay but if you're paying for it it's usually not that much cheaper it's maybe a tiny bit cheaper the big problem is it's not portable and what that means in the insurance world as you leave the company\nYou can't take it with you so let's say you had a cancer scare or mine or heart attack and now you're not sure\nIf you get diabetes now you're not insured and you leave that company you got in a life insurance that you can't take this with you and says okay to have a little at the company but I wouldn't have it all their lives is that I Ramsey show [noise]\n\nAll big John extraordinary things start from ordinary things that may start from changing the ordinary habits in your day to day life you see changing these habits is the foundation of our teachings after smart conferences and I'm excited to announce

pastor always said don't let the world teacher theology\nYou know and are so good stuff you guys so what do you tell people when they find that you got forty nine thousand dollars worth of debt paid off what are you don't like the keys to getting out of that are\nLike I said one of the change in mindset um you know I uh I always wanted to drive a newer car I never bought a brand new car but I had that mindset that you're always going to have a car payment and so you know you pay for a guy for five or six years and they would against you think you should we get another payment and and uh so we have not had a\nCar payment for four years we were driving to very old cars one is sixteen years old the other one's eleven years old wow but we drove it\nUp here from South Carolina this morning and it made it fine so it made it finally gets us where we need to go and you know never again\nNever again well now you don't really pay much you can save up in the ... Bob below a better car that's right yeah uh what about you know really what do you say the keys to getting out of that are\nUm for me it was mostly contentment ... like I like to watch HDTV and make lots of honey do list a laid back and kind of have an e content with what we've got and I'm just kind of weight on it until we saved up for it and\nI'm kinda interested when you sat down to do the taxes that night and you had a moment it was kind of that I've had it moment we're not living like this anymore I'm I've come to the end of the U.S we're going to change can you describe what was happening inside of you or what was happening in your head or in your heart\n... I felt like probably like everything I was doing was kind of ... ...
