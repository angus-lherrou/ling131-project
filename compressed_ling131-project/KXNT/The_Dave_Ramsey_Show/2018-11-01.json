agency\nBut if you think that the gate closed and properly and you weren't doing anything wrong in the stupid thing broke your car they need to fix your car and not charge you for the gate right\nRight that's what you're telling me and if that's the case um you know\nIn a letter from an attorney may solve the whole thing uh but they're not scared of you obviously\nAre so we need to get someone that gets their attention\nBecause basically you're getting run down by a corporate ladder here uh this is probably a corporate owned or ... owned apartment complexes being quote unquote professionally managed and so you're not dealing with a mom and pop you just got stuck in the vortex here and the only way to jog that out is shock somebody\n\n\n\n\nYou're open to five five to five job it was all about your life and your money ...\nComes from blind spots on find out for yourself why blind spots on is the number one online retailer of custom window coverage or\nYou'll get free

to their rooms or dot com and says is dental insurance for my kid I was a gimmick\nOr something I should keep paying dental insurance is one of the most easy insurance has to figure out that they're charging you more than you're getting\nUm we've had dental insurance propose to us as a a a\nEmployee benefits several times and it's really simple when you add up what you pay for it in a year you'd never spend that much on dentistry\nIt just doesn't work out\nIt's one of those things you should self insure through now we do have an advertiser that is with us\nThat is a a dental discount\nCompany and that is worth it\nBecause that helps you get discounts on your dental repairs your dental work and so forth and um you know you can check them out as well you can find them on our website\nOne dental is what it's called one dental\nAnd dreams just helped me 'cause I was looking at my brain was we're firing you know I couldn't remember are great people to have gotten another\nOne dental but it's a discount program for dental services about deals worth it and we do do it but we've had done to insurance attempt advertiser many terms and we just simply don't let them Christine is with us from Hartford, Connecticut Hi Christine how are you\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOh my goodness longtime listener and just so excited never called before so um my husband and I are debt free\nIncluding our house way to go\n[laughter] yeah well thank you for your teaching we followed them off [laughter] um and we are actually we're everyday millionaires I'm a teacher he is not Christian\nAnd I'm so we we've been investing in a way that you recommend and you know just out of curiosity we finally decided to meet with an e LTV went online and found on one that you your site recommend\nThey may know him on the rover investing yes okay yes\nYes in Norfolk ... thank you okay um and we met with him and they were very uh ... you know had a lot of information for us\nAnd then you know the the structure is like a ... percent [laughter] I guess and\nSo when my husband and I didn't know is simply been investing in a way that you teach since we've been you know we both are blessed to have pensions\nWe have you know we're only in our fifties and we and we could retire and five years you don't have to but we we couldn't be comfortable um would would it still makes sense\nTo hire\nUm a financial person for a year at you know whatever I think it's like five thousand dollars a year because they go on a five point five percent of what you're\nActually they're lucky they're proposing a ... a manager to count for you correct OK yeah a lot of the industry has gone to the managed to kill an approach and uh so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you're going to ... and I'm anytime\nThe streets gone to the managed to count approach and uh so the question is what do you get for your money that's what you come ... and I'm anytime you're investing in when I'm investing by the way my personal money's invested with one of our smart rest approach okay [noise] um and so the\nThere's two ways to do investing in mutual funds upfront fees or that as you do the investment they charge a fee and then there's very low almost no\nA annual after that or they managed account or it's a percentage of the balance every year\nAnd now what are you getting for that while they're helping you select the funds and putting you in funds that are out performing the market overall um you know I Hope over a long period of time over average\nYou know funds that outperform the S. and P. and of course you've got someone to meet with uncover any time there's a question about anything I'm a if there's a change in the market and you're worried about it or up or down um anything along those lines and there's tons of studies that say that\nYou will come out ahead doing those two things one is getting good advice and picking the proper funds and to ah you know just not jumping off the ledge every time somebody comes on the news and freaks out you're probably not already not doing that one\nWhen we look at I mean I like to do every day no doubt sample you've got that\nDali and you're not going to jump off the roller coaster and get hurt you know so that that part of stuff so you know the thing is just asked them to show you okay why are you worse what is your charging and uh you know 'cause you're charging me a fee argue worth that uh and in most cases you'll find it is\nThat right there you're going to make more than the cost of the fee in extra returns and certainly in services in terms of uh you know education is available to you and\nUm you know there's eight thousand mutual funds to go through I don't keep up with a thousand mutual funds I have a day job you know and so a life you know I don't want to do that but those guys that's all they do all day long is comb through those funds\nIt's the whole world they eat live and breathe that stuff and it's I also don't work on my own car\nOr I could probably fix my car cheaper than the mechanic fixes it but it would take me longer\nOr there'd be several trial and error is along the way I might break something in the process and so it's worth it to me to get somebody to hook the computer up to the car that\nActually has the computer hooks up to the car instead of me being a redneck laying on the trying to figure this out and it's kind of like you know investments I don't know why those either um I don't even do my own taxes are and I'm pretty good at this stuff it's what I Do I'm a money guy and got a natural event for math and all that kind of stuff but\nI don't why when he gets the end of the ... the the\nYou know the dirty details so to speak so that's why I think you're going to find the investment is worth that the managers account is worth it but I it's fair to ask them to show you\nGot it the typical guy does this or you've been doing this over here but if you had been with us during that same period of time and here's what we would have had your and here's what the ... and it you know what a major one and a half percent more would cost you a half a percent street and ended up for one\nThat kind of a thing um it's a fair question to say hey prove your worth and uh I don't think any smart Mr pro that we have would um\nTell you that that they can't do that um that they all obviously all believe that they can and then just asking to show you that question Alex is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Alex welcome to the ...\nAnd I are you doing today better than I deserve\nAlex is with us from Charlotte North Carolina Hi Alex welcome to the day Ramsey ship\nOr are you doing today better than I deserve certain what's up\nA question um maybe a better question or Gary Coleman about my career uh I'm currently and buy food and I'm a welder at work out of town and I'm Mike around a hundred and forty thousand a year mhm and um\nI've got opportunity to go work at home but the pay is about a third of water on my working out of town and um there are serious if he thought it was crazy to take a job that I'm I'm not married yet I'm getting married next month\nYou're making a hundred and forty and you'd make like fifty\nYeah\nOK at home I'm ... where are you where are you working out of town\nA member going on now come on [noise] um I Lived on the world were on um you know my own hand they own marketing right now I'm On\nAnything other than that they can file a mhm okay\nWell I think the answer for me would always be see none of the above ... ... I liked the idea coming off the road I don't like the idea of a two thirds pay cut so I got to figure out how can I don't either how can I come off the road and make more money\nWhat do I gotta do to make more money off the road or can I Do some kind of a mix and say I'm going to be gone two weekends a month and a ... and ...\nThere's some OT out on the road that way and pick up some serious change as until but is there is there a pass a career paths at home or whether it's owning your own shop\nOr a you know I don't know run running a different kind of a ... a different way of doing this rather than just saying a J. O. V. at home versus a robe jobs is there another way to do this and that's that's what I'm going to be kept the rocks I'm going to be turning over looking\nFor is to how to do that and um you know where do I want to be one I'm forty and will be on the road\nYou don't wanna be on the road already you told me that\nGetting married don't blame you I think it's gonna be home with a new wife [noise]\nLike good question I think you can figure it out but it's a tough one this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\nWhy in the world would you trust some random guy in a Q when getting your mortgage\nYou know it works the same as compound interest you know it was a very powerful thing mhm um for the single folks out there working on their debt snowball did an accountability partner hanging around people that are have those positive positive relationship and influence on you know I'm after that\nIt's focused mhm because now this day and age where social media audience distractions\nUm life happened to us during the debt pay off and I happened to us you know before the end we rent a dating phase any engagement you know for example um before we were married she dealt with depression for several years I've dealt with strings of unemployment I had written notice is on my door\nMy rent was only forty five at that time and I have a three straight months\nOf a late written notice is ... so it was tough times and then even once we got into the ... snowball\nMom or a little bit before that whenever I got my job offer I went through a grant program and it was tough we we do some things that were our fault for example when I got to use cars have pictures of him um we had a bunch of car repairs\nWe got those cars right before we moved from South Carolina the Houston Mm So you talk about stupid on

mean what are your degrees\nIn my degree is in public health and biology and you did grad work you said at one\nTime in human resources okay very good\n... career sharp Koppel you guys are rock stars touchdown you\nSee\nGreat like the momentum is crazy because um you know they were going bad or just compounds on top of want to know when it's going good has been very good since we pay it off the debt or we've been able to where we are pretty much making over ... years ago we were broke\nWant to know when it's going good has been very good uh since we've paid off the ... uh we've been able to we were pretty much making over the years we were we were broke\nSo we've rated R. furniture good uh we're able to go out to eat a lot of restaurants go with a budget those you know car repairs you know good my vehicle gonna shut right now but I'm not words hitters I'm not going to have a bill following me home absolutely so are you ... the other one if you need to that is correct\nYeah you

biggest cheerleader I Know you kept it mainly to yourself or\nTo say my mother I'm not\nI have her work ethic instilled in me like through and through work when I was growing up she dealt with someone employment what's her a job at the end it makes a certain facility down in about Grover crazy just you know not have anything to do on a daily basis and I I felt that when I was unemployed as well
