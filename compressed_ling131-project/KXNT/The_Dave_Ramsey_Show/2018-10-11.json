[noise] um I'm not visited up the fight on hiring again\nI'm not alone for a living like that I'm On there I left um um but minimum like I picked for a hobby company max and now I'm ...\nI'm Sorry about that but again it other than that I have um caving in my dating back home and in from outside of the gate and drive\nMore than that I'm living in the short evenly I'm Talking to you\nOr maybe that's not the right they do it but I'm told I mean I'm ... I'm Out in a long term commitment\nBy that\nTime uh I mean the the problem with short term invest\nBird I'm a you know short term investments basically savings account and it's going to pay you know one to two percent right now\nI'm you know and when you do long term investments and then you pull them out short term as you said you can get the market could move down on you and you could actually lose some of the money so um if you want to position some of it in long term investments with the idea\nThat the hope that we are going to make some more about the idea that we could actually lose some won't take some risk with some of that that's an okay thing to do um\nBut you know basically if you know you're going to need the money and the actual principals very important to you I you know there's not a ... intermediate investment that I'm comfortable with that I use a so I'm pretty much either putting it in a savings account or I'm investing it\nAnd sometimes I'm investing it knowing that I may or may only be in their year and it could be down in a year and but I'm going to take that risk just because that's money I can say that I have a little bit of um margin with meaning I Can't afford to lose a little bit of money\nAnd if that's the case then then it's okay but that that's what we're faced with the ... is in Minneapolis ... how are you\nHey Dave how're you doing better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nHi I'm a I'm currently in college and I paid cash transfers master and I'm planning on joining the national guard but I'm Wondering if I should continue going to college after I joined the national guard or if I should go back to my home town and just live with my parents for that I'm basically getting paid to go to college\nOkay when you go back to your hometown live with your parents would go to a different college\nYeah I'd go to a university that's within twenty minutes of my parents' house\n... okay if you don't go back home you\nWould stay where you are obviously and you would um can you pay cash\n[noise] ah yeah if I was able to if I can save money that I'm making during the national guard and I work on top of the ship build the cash flow it\nOkay and how much do you like finishing school\nExcuse me\nWhat year are you in school I'm I'm a freshman policy got three and a half years to go or whatever\nWell yeah and then I Am actually think laugh sophomore credit so I graduate in two years\nOkay she got two years to go what are you studying finance okay and why would you stay where you are\nJust because it has a better business a school recognition I guess for the state\nMhm okay the other places water community college or university this local or\nYeah just the local university and not as um right now I'm at the University of Minnesota which has a lot bigger I guess too\nRight okay All right well um\nIf you actually get of the knowledge the reputation of the school really doesn't matter much in Ninety nine percent of the jobs up there okay\nIf you actually get the knowledge now if the actual quality of the education is lower then that's a different discussion okay\nBut I Would not stay someplace merely for its reputation [noise] you know there's other reasons that you want to stay in that location you like it there you want to stay in that area you you know you've enjoyed the\nUh the experience of being there and you're willing to work to pay for it if you can pay cash for it I'm OK either way there's not a financial problem either direction\nOr it's just a matter of of where you want your degree to be from where you want to live the next two years\nYou know your age I likely would have stayed where you are because I'm going to work just to be out on my own [noise] uh that's how I watch\nBy you might not feel that way and that's okay so you're just trying to what is it the what's the pay off of the extra effort and that is worth it that's what you're asking [noise] this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents and a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nAnd gas to eat okay\nNow I don't really give a rip whether you can see Downton Abbey or not but I Am more concerned about you having lots of water on\nAnd gas to heat if it's gas heat\nOkay so you pay your basic necessities food and utilities you make enough to do that and get current on them right now\nNumber three shelter now you pay your rent\nDoesn't matter if you pay your rent and you can't sleep there because there's no heat\nOkay so you pay your rent if you're behind on your rent before you move on to number for you catch up on your rent\nNumber for transportation\nYour current on the car and you keep gash in the car now if that takes all your money and you can pay nothing else this month oh well\n\nNow I mean but think about this if you got a place to live this current you're not going to get evicted your\nUtilities are all current and they're not going to get cut off and you have food and the ... the car is not going to get ... and it's got gas and and so you can go to work you live to fight another month that's very essential that you get through the ... and you do make enough to get through those\n\nBut you've been feeding the other monsters and the other monsters of the people to call and scream at you and in order for them to not screaming at you or you pay them\nDon't pay them\nMasterCard is not in front of your children eating metric art can jump in the creek discovered bondage can sit over there in ... we're not giving them any money\nAmerican Express can definitely by my ankle\nSeriously right\nThey can sit over on the sidelines right down to you get your food shelter clothing and utilities transportation and taking care of college student loan people tell Sallie Mae she has own hardship for oh so you're not getting the ban\n\nThen you begin to continue to work down the list and you get to who you can get to in order of importance\n\nAnd you just work the list and work to lift and work the list now if you got a big pile of debt and you don't see any hope past those things then it's time to start talking about what we can sell and what we can do to create an income I mean you may have to amputate the taco\nOr you may have as big stinking car payment this killing you you may have to take like six extra jobs and drive for a job or or deliver pizzas or clean somebody's toilets on the weekends I don't know what you're going to do but my grandmother used to say there's a great place to go when you're broke to work\n\nIncreased income make the money behave take care of your necessities first we call that the four walls of your house when\nYou have the four walls of your house protected the people inside are safe and the dry\nThen you live to fight another day the powders dried I go to battle as they say you gotta have the gun powder dry or it won't work right shall we ought to have a plan we get all those things laid out in his step by step by step by step see I'm feeling better about your situation already\nBecause I don't even know your numbers but I've done this for Thirty years and I almost I'd say Ninety nine point nine percent of the time I sit down with someone that has a job they can take care of food shelter clothing transportation and utilities and by what you don't need clothing you got clothing just wear what you got\nAnd ah if you got to buy the kids are ... or ... or something that's fine but you you only be mine much clothing your club most I've got enough clothing last we're not trying to make a fashion statement right now people were drawn to survive\nSo I don't care\nGet to that stuff later we're talking about this month where you don't feel hopeless anymore where you have a sense of direction where you see a lot at the end of the tunnel this modern oncoming train and when you've got food your lights and water are current and they're not about to be cut off you got your rent current you're not about to get a victim or foreclosed on on your home your car\nBut those basic things done and you can get most of that done in one or two months if you quit I and everything else I mean you get behind on your credit cards further will show what\nWe'll get back to them later we get behind on Sallie Mae further ... what she going to do just get uglier well get

Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nSo I'm forty five and I'm looking to retire at fifty five I'm I have a pension and I'll be getting like Seventy five percent of my pay\nCheck in four one K. and stuff like that but um [noise] I've been recently started listening to you and I've already paid out some I made that but um what's left is only about thirty four hundred but I'm sure I'll be able to pay off the Ninety Days through um [noise]\nBut my question is I've been looking into refinancing in my house because I have an F ha and so I have PM I\nAnd I when I Do the math like the six thousand dollars and closing costs versus the hundred and eighty seven month ended up being three years plus my interest rate is going to go up so I'm not sure if that's the smart thing to do ... okay\nYou're staying home longer than three years that's the only way you're gonna end up getting gravy on that biscuit right yeah for sure\nSo um that's how you analyze it um that's that's kinda borderline that's the tipping point is much longer than three years I probably on your break even analysis are probably would not\nBut if you're you know Ninety percent sure you're going to be there longer than three years you're going to pass the break even point start making money even at a higher interest rate is what you're telling me right\nI'm In a well I'll get out of having to pay the hundred and eighty seven\nYeah how but where your interest rates go up and all that\n... well yeah 'cause I'm a three point seven five now and everything I'm getting a quote is about like for you know so you're not going to make any money so is it better just to stay in it and pay the\nThumb and you're gonna be a force you're probably gonna be four seven five on a Fifteen year right now uh today and so that's like a one percent spread 'em and so what is your a loan them out\n[noise] this one is a hundred and sixty six\nThousand okay and so one in three years I've already paid off ten thousand\nAbout one percent on a hundred and sixty six thousand increase is sixteen hundred dollars a year okay and you're only\nArea everybody is already in session but some of them have only done one class\nJumping I still don't even go in yeah jumping you'll be okay All right yeah the first classes on savings and you're already head of the game on that you're you're in Michigan and you can go back and watch it on with your online because you've got a one year membership and you can watch and listen to everything on line for a year\nOkay so yeah you know I didn't watch the less than one and then when you go in Iraq with whoever zone listen to your right in sync okay\nYou have no trouble or at all you're doing great way to go dawn you killed a ghetto Christine is with us in Boise idaho I Christina how're you\nDoing well thank you Dave\nI'm so we haven't had a great situation for our family that I'm not quite sure how to proceed we I'm told her home in California and walked away with a lot of equity um and had steak with Boise how much but wait I'm Sorry what was that how much equity\nAbout two hundred and forty thousand boom\nBoom love it yeah um so we're here it gets renting while we kind of figure out you know if we want to build or by [laughter] um but I'm not\nQuite sure because we already have our our savings we have our retirement we have all that\nOut of debt that we just go yeah we don't have any debt good um but do we just go and maybe take cash for a house yeah surely what we want or how we think what we wanted we want where\nWe you know we want something that's gonna cost us more than what we have all\nKinds we'll put a small mortgage on it paid off real fast\nOkay you know what I mean I think you're\nI mean well I mean what's your household income\nOr about a hundred and fifty\nOkay and what what would you be talking about building or buying or pressuring\nOh price range between four and six\nOkay and you have to forty and the bank mhm okay so if we should for forty as an example Utah but two hundred thousand dollar mortgage right All right how about your company that all five years true dabbling yep yeah I mean does not know how old are you guys\nI'm I'm forty five and my husband's fifty\nYou have any money in savings or investments to this not in a retirement I don't\nKnow if this is all kinds of it [laughter] All right\nWell my rule of thumb is never take out a mortgage that is on more than a Fifteen year mortgage and the payments more than a fourth of your take home pay you're not even going to approach\nThat the right way and then you'll be close to that and so if you take out a two hundred and fifty\nThousand or more did you don't really find house in Boise idaho for a half million dollars that's a long house that's wonderful property and about what\nWe're hoping more real property then that would make out\nAnd it's a whole different world though obviously more you've got a problem right\nAnd so I'm mean your bang for buck is huge in Boise a compared to you know big City California so um yeah you you're going to make a huge progress here and you know you just about whatever if you take a small mortgage or out in a small relative to your situation in other words\nI'm not going to yell at you know I don't borrow money so ... we'd be buying a two hundred fifty thousand dollar house and then we'd be saving money and we'd move up later and that's how we would do because I mean we don't borrow money for any reason ever\nBut if it's the only thing I don't yell at you for borrowing on on this show and in your case no just have the different mindset\nThat the mortgage is just more like a car loan\nAnd we're just going to knock it out real fast and like other people's ... to Carla like five years or something\nAnd there and how fast can we knock this thing in the head and let's get after it and that's how I Want to think about it it's a really good question thanks for joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Sarah is in California Hi Sarah welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] and I was wondering if I should tell my car worrying about eight to ... ... pay off\nMy about forty thousand dollars a day and start my emergency fund like card paid off\n... what is your household income\nAbout thirty thousand a year\nYou should not have an Eighteen does La Guardia issues is that what you have too much tied up I don't think it's going down in value when you're out on your car or things with motors wheels of any kind added up equals more than half your annual income how did you end up with an Eighteen dollars are paid for car making thirty grand\nAnd I was married and we refinanced our house and they included the car in the mortgage\nAnd then he got and and\nThen we got a divorce and we sold the house in the car was paid off\nGot it okay and I got a car nut so what is your um what is your income prospects meaning you're thirty now where will you be in a year where were you being three years\nRight around thirty thirty tail so you don't see ... you'll see this doubling then now okay why\nAnd how they got to school yet okay and I'm a single mother fighter and so yeah you you need the money more than you need that car don't treat yeah yeah\nI in the cars going down in value quick show yeah Charlotte pay off your dad put your emergency for unemployed you can get you an inexpensive car that you pay cash for probably in the five thousand dollar range\nOkay maybe seven or something like that there's something reliable and you get lots of car for five to seven thousand dollars right now\nIn your debt free and you got a good emergency fund and they'll put you in a much better position but as a rule of thumb cars are the largest thing that we all by the goes down in value anything what wheels or motors for that matter if it's got wheeler motor\nIt it's going down in value and when you have all of that stuff out of together you don't want too much of your life financially too much of the math on the wrong way and you get when you have more than half your in your on your tongue tied up and things going down in value then that makes it real tough to prosper\nIn your case you're going to change your income by going to school and things don't change later but for right now I'm with you yeah I Would sell that cost dishes today Ramsey show\n[noise]\n\n\n\nTime to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money on the table one of the biggest expenses as your mortgage payment I recommend the quick Churchill checkup and just five minutes our friends at Churchill mortgage\nIt takes away most of that spread when you when you you know when you factor interests 'cause we're there is risk when you have mortgage now is not a lot of risk 'cause you've got the money in the bank today to pay it off but\nEr an investment by it off but there is risk and so ah you have to admit that you know one hundred percent of the foreclosures are current home with a mortgage there is rich and so I'm getting rid of that\nWhen I found this it's not completely quantifiable I'm In a simple mathematical formula\nBecause when you don't have a mortgage you start making different decisions with your career you start making different purchase decisions you start having different levels of enjoyment with your money\nYour relationship with your spouse talks to have a different depths because there's a a level of security in your overall life that there wasn't before and those things are really hard to put on paper so what I figured out is I'm going to live a hundred percent that free\nAnd I'm going to invest like crazy the rest of the money that I haven't actually comes in and I've ended up with a ton of money doing that because I don't have any risk and I'm just investing real money not borrowed money so\nAll of that to say if I woke up in your shoes I pay off your mortgage today and if you ... if this discussion bit sour on you and you think they rammed she's crazy a year from now just gets you into the mortgage\nNo I I I I completely agree I mean I for one thing that he got ... is just if it's a lot of money after a while you know I just go back and get paid off of my mind sort of just wrestle back or a\n... and I what I'm trying to point out is is that your the your gut is not intellectually wrong your mind is your minds using an incomplete primitive formula\nGot it\nYeah after you got this thanks for the call open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five shoot your heart's where he's not really you got your heart your heart's where you measure rich march telling me pay off my house my hands telling me I could make more money on these what do you need money\nWith your heads mission some stop its mission rich\nAnd um it's kind of a fun thing that I was doing this for the clash of MBAs\nSpeaking to them and uh 'cause MBAs or all talk you know masters in business they're all taught strategic thought and they're all taught to borrow money\nAnd uh I got a finance degree I was taught to borrow money my broke finance professor used to teachers to borrow money and so um you know it it's broke finance professor at like a shop teacher would missing fingers right people so think about this rise by ... ... you just can't think that way and you have a different way of looking at things show 'em\nBut there's you can really do a very\nSophisticated mathematical application of this it would just take a lot of time too much time really in the radio to walk through the whole thing but\nWhat happens is is think about this how many of you if you had zero that and you looked over in your four one K. and there's three hundred thousand dollars and you had forty thousand bucks in the bank for emergency fund would make different career decisions\nWay too many readers said yes meaning I Would leave this jerk but I worked for it and I would go do dot dot dot\nUnless I go in business for yourself necessarily might just have a different career you\nMight go on a completely different direction that thing you've always wanted to do why are you waiting\nYou know\nAnd here's the weird thing is that saying you've always wanted to do is probably where you make the most money you've ever made in your life if you're wise about how you do it this idea that if you're going to live your passion you make half the money no you make twice the money\nYou make more money when you as you're good at 'cause you work harder at your creative you think about all the time you can't keep yourself from moving 'cause you love it\nYou don't think I Love what I Do I Can't keep myself from sitting at my laptop writing a blog article I Can't keep myself from doing it I Can't keep myself from coming down there and doing this radio show when I'm In town I was\n...\nAnd I'm really good at it as a consequence because once I get paid a lot a lot of money on a shame middling I'm a capitalist pig baby I love this I'm here by me that's how I Want that for you see that's what\nSet you up to me how many of you if you didn't have any payments would tell your boss or is a jerk chicken\nTake this job and shut it I mean we would do that yeah there you go that's a man and I'm not trying to\nQuit your job today I'm saying there are benefits to being debt free that are beyond the simple mathematics of the fact you don't have to be interesting you start to be set free slavery is more
