number two it's over a period of years\nAnd is the uh\nSo after that that's number one number two it's over a period of years\nAnd is the uh is the\nUh financial institutions going even report they forgave the debt I think you're okay I really do the problem is\nUh do you say I've forgiven of this that you say here's the amount of paid in insurance and I don't even know if you do that with uh the feds when filing an IRS a return if you talk about the amount of money that you've paid in credit card debt\nOr whether or not you have negotiated a lesser payment for the bottom line is that yes that's considered income\nBut it's considered income over the three years so it's what sixteen Seventeen hundred dollars a year income to the change much I don't know if you get audited you'll be tag for uh eight hundred bucks income tax so I don't know if I Would do it or not and the answer your question would have to go to my accountant which I'll be more than happy to give you the number of\nUh

about three years I left that implement about a year and a half ago and during the for years I worked for them I worked a considerable amount of overtime a during last six months I worked in an average of eighty hours\nPer week and it's a live wire ensue if you left the year and a half ago Tom why are you calling now\nWell that is part of my question ah I wanted to know a is there a time limit\nThere is a statue but you still may be within a I I don't know if it's a year and I I don't have the statute in front of me uh but I think if you don't make the claim\nThe statue but you feel maybe within ah I I don't know if it's a year and I I don't have the statute in front of me uh but I think if you don't make the claim within certainly there there is a statute I just don't know one year six months whatever it is if you are passed that time you're out of luck so the trick is for you to contact the state\nDepartment of industrial relation there's a whole section of a there's a whole section involved with wage enforcement\nAnd you can look on the website they'll have a state of California and then the the department of dust relations and then frequently asked questions or there'll be some somewhere there they don't talk about a statute okay\nYeah um can I can I ask you sure the question is if we still don't get somebody told me it was three years okay and there would be\nIf we assume that um you know I'm within the time I'm One of the things about it is um during the last six months that I worked eighty hours a week um the the management wife\nUh passed away that's all I stepped in and basically uh just just rather show\nFor them a during during that\nWell it did they know you were working eighty hours yes\nAll right okay doesn't it doesn't matter what for what reason you're working eighty hours\nWell that's the thing is that according to them basically a if you're a manager you get paid a salary\nThat's true that's true but you you reach a point where I ... I think eighty hours it and he was over as a a little bit over ... over the top here and you were not as you are not a an hourly employee\nWell that's just the thing they never actually made me the manager several times\nWhere are you an hourly employee doesn't matter if you took over management jobs were you an hourly employee\nDoes actually commission and play um that the commission\nOkay so your weight body okay so your commission but you're still an employee\nCorrect it was just based on a commission um yeah I think you you get paid it's time for you to look at uh the website and if nothing else you talk to an employment discrimination attorney and see if anything's there because it could be pretty substantial\nSo you can go to the website you can go to the website and look for handling a handle on the law dot com\nAnd just look at attorneys who employment discrimination those are the people that we look on that employment law [noise]\nThis is handle on [noise] used ... yeah I tend to be [laughter]\n\nIn the backyard looking great Rob thanks man I was planning on adding a deck to no one could contractors why don't you just ask home advisor\nOn one home advisor dot com you just tell them about your project and they match you with local Rosa can do the job [noise] nice now how much does it cost home advisors totally free to use plus you can reach customer reviews check pricing and book appointments for free\nWhat's the website again home advisor dot com for just download to bring home advisor [noise]\nThere's nothing small about your your passion your hours your reputation all huge\nYour partnership even with down small business technology advisors you'll get the tax and bank and one on one partnership to help your business ground because with a reliable down PCs with him down core processor you can focus on what matters now getting business down\nSeven seven die down to speak with an advisor today at age seven seven by down\nMessage indeed ... burning your degree from one of the ...\nThat eight seven seven I doubt\nMessaging to raise ... burning your degree from one of the top business\nSchools in the country might sound impossible to fit into your workload but what if there were a business degree that further your career and gave you access to world renowned faculty leaders and mentors all on your schedule one that open doors to some of the most influential CEOs tech companies law firms entrepreneur in thought leaders\nAnd what if you could earn that degree in his little sixteen months one hundred percent on line\nTo find out more checks scale to seven nine six four or five\nDash S.

identification on him in order for lots of your check box ... when the head of the car and drove through my luck uh open up my door\nAnd my ex but he went in and so my wife's thirty bucks to go ahead and ... ...\nThe third improperly instant the letter to work as well and uh he never showed up for the first time a court [noise] and um now you have an extension and he's trying to make it the judgment\nWell ... all you have to show up again it's not a question of vacating the judgment all you do is appealing and he gets in and he gets an appeal if he asks for it it's called the trial to know what was so it's not just not making the judgment\nIt's as if it never happened at this point once he follows the appeal David there is no judgment to vacate it's a brand new trial is this the first one didn't happen but here's the problem you're going to have\nAnd that is a he stole my wife's\nJewelry box what what how much is that worth but how much uh what what was the value of those jewels inside\nOf the ... the five thousand dollar yeah and how do you prove that\nWell we have received the also have a multiple pictures of her grand jury rough\nOkay All right and you have and you have receipts for all the jewelry and you can actually points every piece of jewelry that she's wearing that a ... that's gone\nOr if you don't have receipts we do have a picture like actual cash value of a similar product\nOkay honey okay I'm just I'm I'm I'm just trying to nail down so far you're doing great David\nUh how your side of the police report so in\nThe piece all important means nothing police report and he's nothing 'cause that's what you said a however uh let's say she's wearing a piece of jewelry and you don't have a receipt how do you establish what that piece of jewelry is obviously you uh you can establish that she owned the jewelry\nHuh she's a I'm not like a sort of puts the Amazon where she can go back to her a lot of history\nYeah but ... but here's the problem is a if you're talking about or is it real gold is a gold plated is said to me there's really no way to tell I mean that's that's the problem is always a question of proof or because the uh the court isn't going to say well here's a piece of jewelry and for example here's the ring a\nAnd it's a and a jewelry store and it's a a thousand bucks well I can get one that looks just like that on Amazon for four dollars and fifty cents so\nHaving a picture it for a very moving and then we go back to her rapist or an Amazon her she purchased it and productively said\nOh yeah and then you got it then and then if you have a picture and you have the Amazon recede then you've got it so now I it's an issue of um you hold the walk Smith liable I Would I'd go for it is actually\nDirectly led to the left and he cannot have proper identification\nOnly that but one of the ways that up but what good if he did have proper identification see that's the problem is the how does a locksmith no who owns the property does he asked for a ... a deed for example there's\nLots of code or whatever like\nI don't I don't I don't know because for example if you go to my house and I keep my deed or in a safe deposit box and I asked a locksmith you know what I Need new keys well no I Need the dean of the house to help prove that you have to call in I'm Sorry who does he call if\nYou if you're taking the ticket done\nNo I didn't know who to who does he call David\nCalling like a telephone but refusing to the third call\nYeah oh I don't understand he was called to show up at a place and why should he who is he supposed to call not show up\nNot college even the telephone history refused taking the service\nCall why in the last with code\nTo call not show up\nNot college even as her for history refuse taking the service\nCall why ... is a lot with code and\nWhy do I don't know of a locksmith code don't want to look at what age what do you expect him to do he if someone calls he should not you know you're not show up\nWhich is you should check identification\n... what I ended up David what is the ID do\nId which show that for me to live that they\nAre saying it has to be it has to be that address got it so it's a showing ID to show that he lived there and he didn't have any idea\nAll right All right All right I Know that it and I certainly concerns no I didn't know that is no no I I think you have an up\nThere certainly to ah to take a locksmith and your friend to court I\nReally love detective due to a court thing with my ex husband criminally with a lot for the court simply\nA yes and the locks and the detectives are going after him criminally Oh yes oh then you know what you do it at that point once you have a ... ...\nHere's what's going to happen once\nHe is a job I Would dismissed the claim okay at this point\nI Would dismiss it with or without prejudice so you can sue again because I'll tell you why if it turns out that he pleads or a couple of things can happen restitution is going to be ordered ... uh and that is far stronger than any judgment you can get\nDavid a judgment for people like this mean nothing you have to go collected\nAnd these cock roaches what do you think or let's say you get five thousand dollars okay you have a judgment against them or we're going to cost about five thousand dollars David\nFrom ... from what the ... [noise]\nOh I'm Sorry I was thinking about your friend a friend or another and then going to say the police so the police are going after the walk Smith right\nWe're going to have to look at the proof is going after my buddy wait so they're not going after the locksmith I don't know I don't I don't think so\nNo I they wouldn't All right so what you have is okay you sue the locksmith for a civil union put all that ... that makes sense All right I think uh I think you have enough there are certainly go to small claims court beautiful yeah I Would if I ... I certainly would take down okay take care of them All right\nSo either ah he didn't do a great job of explaining all of that or I'm an idiot and actually I'm leaning towards I'm an idiot on that call\nHuh yeah 'cause if I had called and asked the ... that\nAnd I got the answer that I ...\nI Would definitely call me an idiot recall whoever cold or the name of bill and idiot even that makes no sense to me oh I think we're going to take another call what are you saying\nHey James\nUh yeah yeah I got a\nPrivate school loan or it's been over nine years now and I wanted the statue of the shows
