with your emergency fund in place um and your debt free which is how we always tell you to buy a house I'm hoping you know sometimes we were you're selling and buying you have to do it a little differently but in your case it's kind of cut and dried isn't it\nYeah it's a pretty simple pretty simple analysis you're either going to\n\nMarriage was in Orlando\n\nTerry's with us in Orlando, Florida Hi Sherry well that I ... I\nHad a great how much it I'm about thirty thousand dollars maybe a little bit more depending on cash\nIs love it yeah only\nWe're trying to figure out what city we have one last one my favorite ... ban on our house mhm\nWe probably could be cut off that we got our emergency finally started finding retirement and we have time girls that are nine years old and we didn't know if we are finding their college fund or if we could pay off\nAnd other countries than on the house tonight on\nHow much is that the ... percent I'm about thirty five and so we use it all up and take it off and okay and what's your interest rate on your home a four point you have to shoot about market there and you are a hundred percent sure that thirty thousand dollars will cause the the amount of be dropped\nThe calculated out it'll be like thirty one about anything that we have we have the money to put the\nYeah and you can argue confirming that with the mortgage company prior to doing it obviously you're not going to just send them the money\nBut you know we want to make sure that the ... going away okay and PMS costing you've watched\n... Fowler quite put him on them and only hired in Ninety nine dollars and caught that\nHousehold income at around ... two hundred thousand\nOkay here here's what here's where you are in our baby steps and you've probably already know this but let's review show our other listeners are caught up you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement orange you\nCorrect yes baby step for five is kids college the Sixers payoff files fairly so really the question is where we can put this on five or we'll put this on sex there's\nNot a ... there's not a dumb or wrong answer here either one is fine whatever makes you feel good whatever's good idea I'm I'm probably going to take twenty thousand of this and put ten each in five twenty nine pounds for these girls\nCome you're getting your college sneaking up on you fast\nAnimals for all the other ten at the house um and then I'm gonna system and then I'm going to set up a monthly amount to add to the ten beginning at the first of the year so that they ... are kind of on auto pilot and so you're going to put you know ten thousand end plus a hundred bucks a month each or something like that not in a microwave\nAnd put them on that I Do have a four year old\nGirl and then you know then we can just spreading around but however you want to do it but ... I Want to put a substantial amount porch college and then you make enough to be able to just beat on this mortgage pretty rapidly but six hundred dollar a year return on the thirty one thousand dollar\nInvestment is not that great\nBut yeah so I'm going to start the kids' college and then I'm going to just start paying off the house\nThe natural result of working your baby steps Sixers you're going to get down below the market that dropped but then you're just gonna keep beating on the house to after that and it's going to go away completely so good question it's an interesting

easiest way to do it is every dollar plus\nAnd every dollar must what that does that help it connects to Europe or you put on your phone and it connects you your bank account and the two of you both have access to both of you put it on your phone and put it on your desktop whatever and no matter where you are in the world she can look at the budget you can look at the budget as long as you get Internet access\nAnd they'll show and then you ... you can obviously disgusted by phone or email or whatever else you want to do on them but you've got um just lay out a game plan that encompasses your expenses there in San Antonio which should be very minimal because I'm guessing you're on base housing right\nYes you're on base food right\nThere so you shouldn't have any expenses if your families back home trying to get out of debt you know your ship and all the money home right yes\nAnd so are most of it I mean but you you just basically going to get a small miscellaneous allowance and then the rest of it's going home for the baby for the kids and for the get out of that plan or whatever you're working back there\nBut the um the ... you know every dollar plus allows you to follow exactly any expenditures that she makes and vice versa because you're dealing awful one bank account and we pushed that through that way so\nI don't where that is one of the well I I'm Sorry if

me now yes ma'am thank you awesome I'm\nTwenty four years old I just graduated a community college about a year ago um\nAnd I like to start making the theory that polluted out um however I just want to avoid waiting it I can\nUm I Do not know that provide and consider the amount of money that I make 'em so if you\nUm how much we can cook yes but I said a Michael carpet up or pay check 'em can move out and really the time that I Want to say to that I Am fortunate enough to have parents kind enough to let you stay within like free\nThat's very ... what do you make um monthly up out of the country\nAnd is that and that's after graduating or what is your degree\nIt's actually a couple of college but um I've actually got a job with the key is to help them find 'em my career\nSo when we're your career kicking in\n[noise] um I'm I'm actually double while I'm On I'm paying money to further my education will take the call so I say about that led to about a year\nOkay well at eleven hundred a month we're talking about a little over Thirteen thousand dollars a year that you're not going to you're going to make it on that in Raleigh out on your own okay you're not making enough to do that so we've got to get your income up that's why I was asking and so um yeah we need a double your income\nOn pretty quick here as fast as you know\nWhen you can double your income and then I Would go get a you know an inexpensive apartment maybe a roommate or whatever and just get started on your own and the main thing there is make sure you have no dad do you have any debt at all\nPay a whole lot when I say\nWell that you know we don't need you to establish any more credit you don't need any that you you don't make enough money to breathe hardly okay so when you are one hundred percent debt free\nAnd then you build an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses like five thousand dollars or set aside\nFor emergencies then you would start saving towards your home and by then you are also in your first apartment and you just start saving as fast as you can and you won't put down as much as you can possibly put down how old are you you said you're twenty four\nOkay good well you got a good plan so hopefully in the next twelve to Eighteen months you can see that income spike up as you start using your cosmetology degree\nAnd um because you know when you're at Thirteen thousand and when you get your twenty six thousand quick as we can that's doubling that's still not a lot of money but that'll at least get you out there and get your moving in and get your career to start to build\nSo hey thanks for the call we appreciate you listening Ian is with us in Prince Edward Hi Ian how are you\n[laughter] Hi Dave thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nWell my wife and

don't think I don't think you need to sell the house houses knocking on your twelve hundred bucks out of a fifty eight hundred dollar take home pay is not at all on\nYour your okay on their house but you do have to get your written budget get on every dollar you're written budget and get that going as quick as you can every dollar dot com and I'm starting to you know using the app on your phone\nAnd you guys need to squeeze every dollar so that you clear there's thirty five is if you can clear the thirty five you're going to have pretty good room in this budget even with five kids and you can clear I did just going to take a year and a half two years just a year and a half two years or Seventeen five a year out of Seventy thousand take home that's doable you can do that as a lay down and you can do that\nSales and out of Seventy thousand with five kids that means one year I don't think you're going to do that so somewhere between the one in there too and that's on landing on Eighteen months Richard is with us Richards in Salt Lake City Hi Richard how are you\nKnow they've got how can I help [noise] so I was wondering about emerging pick on we have a fully funded emerging\nI knew it out of three to six months of good and\nI have about ... camp out in there I'm at my job for H. up they account match up to Fifteen hundred dollars a year great um should should I fully fund the account and should account that towards any of our emergency Fonda\nHolly funded to get that match that's wonderful in the ... of course you can only be used for one kind of an emergency and that's medical bills will lots of other kinds of emergencies pop up and so um do you do you do both of you work in this house for as a single income\nYou know single and okay and what's your household income of around sixty and what do you do er nurse\nYour nurse okay very very stable career\nMeaning that if you were to lose a job you can get another one in twenty minutes\nNursing is just a fabulous career field so in terms of ah accessibility even add hours anytime you want to add hours you can back at all you can change direction all kinds of stuff you just really and landed in a sweet spot there so very very good on that given that you've got that type of a career that's not\nSo specialized that it might take you six months to find a job if you lost it or something to take your six minutes um then\nGiven that that's the situation I Would back and do you fully fund you're at it you find that I just say between the three to six months of expenses range I Would back it down to the three months\nOkay and so that's kind of like partially leaning on the ... say as part of your emergency fund but it's certainly not\nWe're not really counting it because I mean you can have lots of emergencies that have nothing to do with medical on your life when you can get you again you could lose your job you could um have the death of a relative and you had to pay for the funeral or wanted to pay for the funeral you can have all kinds of different things happen transmission blow out of the car and all kinds of things that\nCan happen that aren't medical and you can't use the H us for anything but medical [noise]\nSo I don't generally counted in the emergency fund but I'm looking at your career stability and the fact you got a big fat ages say with a big fat match on it which is just wonderful\nBoth of them then that makes me very comfortable being on the three months side of the three to six months [noise] range for your emergency [noise]\n\n\nQuestion I get asked all the time is do I need life insurance listen the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone who counts on you so if you have a spouse\nOr you have kids yes you need term life insurance is the only way to protect them until you're out of data to build up your wealth\nYeah we were absolutely we were in in in in your guys his ministry hands down\nOff some very cool well we're glad we're part of it gives you guys are heroes man what a great story you're absolutely right and what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nI'd say there's a few things obviously one hundred percent if you're not a team with your spouse there's no way you're going to get out of that I don't see how it was enough troubles in trials in life that if you guys I'm working together at Thursday's when I was struggling that she wasn't and vice versa\nUm and then obviously the plan that you guys set forth um and then you have to be real with yourself and I think not not live the entitled lifestyle that you're going to borrow other people's money to lose I mean\nYou know we talked about this and if you make thirty thousand dollars in this country are more blessing

three literally three job she has three different jobs really I got credentialed at another university and I would go and cause I have a lot of time off with my job and I\nI didn't want to I didn't want to drive three hours and stay the night on my days off in in the university and and work extra but\nYou know seeing them in the rearview mirror made me want to do with that much more than just get it done and\nIt's you know I I did you make it that gay for my average income was probably you know without working extra is probably one Seventy five I'm leaving it up how much on that extra\nProbably another ten or Fifteen just in a short period of time and then and then I started getting more opportunities at my at my institution um and you know I got the only lease it I think he would approve of\nThis is Dave Ramsey leaf um when I sold my truck I was going on Craig's list and I was going to buy a beat her for a thousand bucks and my dad's got more cars and he knows what to do
