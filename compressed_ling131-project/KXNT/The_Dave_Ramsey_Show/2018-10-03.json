shoes on that's AAA eight to five five two to five Jim is with us here in Philadelphia Hi Jim\nHow are you good they buy from Iran sure what's up\n[noise] um my wife and I work currently in baby steps to uh we started this time last year with about a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in debt or we'd been because they all intents and paid off our thousand dollars wow how's the smog yes a\nSold my brand new pickup truck sold a race car um wow everything where although we um we have in an extreme situation a we have one child and we look no expand our family however we're going to need to I'm related to ivy F um we still have another\nSixty six thousand dollars to\nPay off what what is your household into\nA were making about a hundred and forty thousand dollars a year right now\nSo you did a hundred in a year but a lot of that was from selling stuff up pretty much a large ... watch out what's the math telling you that it's got how long is he going to take you do this or the sixty\nUm [noise] if we if we continue on this course where we have literally sold everything so the rest that she's going to be working really are I think it's going to be probably about another year maybe a little bit more\nThat's what I was thinking what is what I Would ask him I saw that OK cool and so what is the pricing model of Avielle that you guys are looking at\nA well we actually met with uh\nOf about twenty thousand mhm I'm uh just you know we haven't found anything or start any any process as yeah we're just still kind of shopping around but twenty thousand or we're looking at a we spoke with other couples and it looks like it was kind of around there\nUm let me give you a little inside okay this comes like a lot because babies are important\nBut I mean having kids is a big deal it's an emotional thing and it causes people to uh you know to to change their financial directions and the to violate things and everything else so let me tell you I I absolutely know nothing about medical things I I'm a medical idiots okay but uh\nI have actually been involved in about this decision probably a hundred times over the years and what I Am hearing even as late as last week a with couples that we are coaching on this is that when they press in they find several different pricing models\nWith the ... in Atlanta is very grandmother died [noise]\nFamily couldn't keep up the house or he's moved in it and they're paying the mortgage and\nWanting to know what to do whether he should fool with us or not and whether you ought to try to buy or work it out or however\nAre somewhat you told me so far sir\nYes oh okay so the the ... ... Ninety five thousand\nCorrect correct okay and the next thing you need to do is you need to talk to a real estate agent and find out what this house was actually worse because right now you don't know\nYeah I don't I don't know a I don't know exactly who if if my wife is my wife is a great grandma so I Know where I live on the lowest say there was a it's a hundred and three ... I don't know if there's even ... they're not\nOr nothing like it was not always that accurate but it's probably not that far off we could use that for discussion purposes okay if you if you found a house that was worth a hundred thousand and you could buy it for Ninety five thousand that really wouldn't be that great a by\nI just being okay by it's not like you get the right great deals are where you just went wow that's the best deal ever right\nThis is I'm not sure if I'm like to even get kicked out 'cause someone gated or should I leave or should I should I go back ran over\nWell where no one on the long term with it you want to own um\nWell my wife she we kind of didn't want to own because we got a daughter she's four and my wife she's in school and now so we just trying to kind of settled down right now\nMhm have you got everything around the area is um like I say my wife great grandma's house she'd been here her whole life so she likes it it's like\nTwo and a half three acres mhm and\nUm it's kind of in a country will bite of Atlanta\nGotcha okay and how old are you to\nUh my wife she turned twenty yesterday and and I'll be Twenty one and a couple of days but we both twenty now\nMhm and you got a a one child you said and how much do you have\nA we don't have any debt\nOkay and what's your household income\nI make about every ... here but I'm trying to get in school\nBut I had to kind of work with the center that was how much I Know the Muslim themselves um I pay about six hundred and Seventeen dollars a month and your wife done work mhm\nOkay that's pretty that's where we live on your budget\nIs is very tight on your budget\nYeah and we get found out about you not too long ago one of my friends from church he recommended me to start listening to you so now we actually kind of made a budget and stuff going out to eat and we're already kinda\nYou know trying to start it off a little better and\nYou are good for you okay well here's the thing if you wanted to buy the house the only way you can buy it is the uh the relatives that are involved that would be the ... ah this would be great grandmothers children or grandchildren\nThat would be the air since there was no will someone would have to petition the court you know to get a lawyer and go to probe a court in probate court would have to rule that the house to be sold and would assign someone to sign the deed as the cellar\nTo be able to give it to you you're going to have to have a court action to do that that's going to cost three two or three thousand bucks to get all that done\nOkay I don't think you need that expense right now yeah though\nWith all the new the numbers you gave me in the situation you're in um now is anybody going to throw you out as long as that mortgages paid I doubt you're gonna get thrown out\nYeah 'cause that's what I was thinking should uh 'cause I also kind of want to actually start even going into real estate 'cause I Do construction that's what I Do know I kind of this house is kinda is not beat a it's kind of beat up and fight the last few years she\nYeah she didn't like other relatives staying there kind of beat in ...\nI mean I don't know if it's like maybe work more maybe you know what I'm saying they Lincoln flipping and get another house or am I left there unless you become the owner of it yeah and and that's why I'm saying like I Do I Need to you'd had I see in a statement learning anything they did hurry up and now like my instinct game where should I\nTell you what I Would do if I were you I Would be willing to walk away from this house some day when you get I I Would treat it like you're renting it\nYou're probably not gonna ever bother to own it and if you do you're going to go through a lot of hassle to become the owner going through this court action that I'm Talking about okay\nSo uh what I Would do is pay that rent or pay that payment of rent I Would not spend any money on this and I wouldn't fret about becoming the owner today\nIt's inexpensive rent in the Atlanta area it's a place you like living any money you spend on it just say to fix it up is money you're probably gonna lose you're probably not ever going to become the owner of this thing\nYeah it's going to be and it's going to be a really strenuous process with the courts to become the owner of this because we don't even know who the heirs are\nYeah well I don't I Know a couple of the day is this is not that many on 'em\nOr that they actually even know about it like I said we we been here for a year so I don't know like should I I I'm not like should I be worried that if they are paying the oil and I just keep paying it\nIn because it's not that you shouldn't be worried because it's not bad rent\nYet but I'm I'm just worried like can't nobody come and get me out 'cause it's not in my name\nYeah they're going to take you out the people that own it can there are the heirs but they'd have to all get their crap together and they're far from doing that\nYeah and they're they're they're far away they're like in another state and\nYeah but they're not they're not worried about this is what I'm saying yeah they're not worried about this at all it's not bothering them one way or the other they're not going to get any money out of it when it sells 'cause it's not worth much more than a vote on it\nIf it was valuable now there'd be some sharks and them water circling right but it's not got any ... because it's not worth any more so you're not going to get kicked out but\nSome day you're going to want to move on so don't spend a bunch of money on it 'cause some day you're just gonna walk off and leave it\nYeah 'cause that because I've already done paying eight and scrape the before they did a little some something you know and to make my life because\nMoney whatever money you spend and make her happy money is gone\nWhen you leave because there's going to come a day two years from now that you guys are going to stand up and walk away or you're going to go to the trouble to get the heirs to take the thing to probate court and get to be transferred to your name\nAnd you can probably do that but again it's going to cost you a couple of thousand dollars and you'd want to make very sure that the property was worth more than the mortgage before you did that and um\nAnd you don't want to spend a bunch of money renovating his house because you're going to very likely move on in about two years but in the meantime I just looked at it as cheap rent\nTo a place you kinda like living\nAnd uh you know six hundred bucks written in line is not a bad gig on two and a half acres\nSo I'm sitting there in front of you for now\nIt's not hurting anything no one's you're not stealing anything you're not doing any more harm the mortgage companies getting paid they're happy the relatives that aren't going to get any money anyways still aren't getting any money everybody's happy but just look at it like you're a renter and some day you're just going to move on\n... worried about being the owner and then if you really want to be the owner then get ready to spend three or four thousand dollars and six months of pain in the ... court actions and you probably can work this through\nYou can gather up all the people you need to sign on it and that's what you're facing so it's an interesting situation but um my guess is it's not worth any more than his old on it my guess is ill as probably fairly close on this\nIf we thought his worth two hundred thousand bucks is a relative thought is worth or a thousand bucks and Ninety thousand was old and they were going to get a hundred thousand their pocket when is old\nNo sharks would already been circling they would have been trying to figure out some way to get that thing sold and get the courts Lou it when you die without a will you have to go in and the judge has to you know authorized the sale of the asset and it has to go into a pool to be dispersed too the heirs\nAre just like it would in a will but it's just a lot bigger mess\nAnd do you can't get cleaned title to this thing unless you do all that and you do not want to become aware of it any other way than doing it properly and getting clean title because you won't be able to sell it if you don't get going title so that's how you do it if you decide to do it later but for today I Would sure either to treat Brent it's a rental house\nHow much money would you spend on a rental house that you're going to move often you don't own a nod any as what you would do hope that helps ma'am thanks for calling in this is the day Ramsey show\n[noise]\n\n[noise]\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of

different level\nAnd a ... and so there's just a sickness that's involved there and it shows up in the money believe it or not and and you can see it\nAnd and after doing that reading that study all

eight fifty per month and we are in the process of looking for new tenant and we have um narrowed it down to three of our top heck\nBut they um unfortunately all of their credit scores are in the last six hundred and they do have little marks on their credit such as a bankruptcy\nI'm due to divorce or medical bills and a collection and um some uh one of our perspective tenants actually just has a um a credit card debt that they're slowly paying down but all three of them have actually\nGone through financial peace university and hatch certificates that they've all for it at me and and they have their emergency plans and they have\nUm the parasite income so am I Am wondering it is that I'm a show of a determination a good enough to rent to them even though they have a checkered a credit history tac yeah All right\nThem or at least making some level of effort to learn how to handle money and not be in the mouse anymore the financial peas university certificates that's pretty cool I

started listening to your show mhm I listen to their ... s on the radio at home and uh became very obsessed with it actually I talked to everybody I go to that was our friends relatives giving her head yes and I I did become a little upset don't you think\nYeah Dave actually the term I coined at some point in this process was tiny I think you need to go to Dave Ramsey rehab\n[laughter] detox [laughter] [laughter] I Love it well there's worse things to get addicted to I guess of proud of that [laughter] so\nHe got a little bit overboard and Sarah is like okay just come on but uh how quickly did you get involved Sarah\nOh very early on I didn't really have a choice you your voices on the and the bathroom as I'm getting ready every day so it was a you know I was in\nFull bore and I and just Dustin was the driving force but it was really\nEasy to get on board so you guys are looked at it and together in all seriousness other than the overdoing the Dave Ramsey part I'm you looked at it together and said hey if we really rolled up our sleeves we can\nPay off his nose that's it you know how to haul moment huh\nYup and we're we're a good team we bounce ideas off each other and we always came to the same conclusion as to what we were going to do and and here we are\nNow you don't have a payment in the\nWorld not then and the grass does do better when you walk on it I'm telling you it's not an exaggeration it's a great metaphor but it's also the truth yeah very cool very cool so how long have you been married eleven years have you ever been dead for a while you were married\n... know this is it there recently or were you ever go back absolutely not\nToo good to be free but amazingly\nAnd gave my favorite part of our story in our journey is we have that almost Seventeen year old daughter and um the term that we've heard over and over is more ... than taught and just seeing how true that is with our daughter it's such an amazing thing to see and she literally as\nYou know a senior in high school and preaching your program to her peers and this is going to continue on and on and on\nWell so the family tree estranged yes settled out I'll just with the money part but with the lessons learned yeah well done you guys doing what do you tell people the key to getting out of debt is\nWell I think it's planning having a plant communicating with your spouse and being real strategic with your money\nWhen we were there were shopping for groceries would go to the discount you know grocery places ... whether it's going if we're going to go out to eat um we're looking for coupons group bonds some sort of deal when you know when we go out to eat and\nWe pretty much every time we go out to a meal we share a entree that it's like no I mean every single time ... so things like that and I don't I'm I'm not a big shopper so all my clothes come from discount stores I never buy anything unless it's on sale\nThat's just how and I and I don't see that changing ever so\nIt can change if you want it to I mean you you don't have your payments no\nMy DNA I I go straight to the\n... well that share and she always tells me how much money she saved me which means that caused me something but yeah I feel [laughter] but nowadays we can afford it it's not a big deal you little like no one else later you can live and give like no one else and you guys are in that position so did you have a people\nIs he a detractors or did you have a more cheerleaders\nAnd we definitely had all cheerleaders around us and no negative comments it through the whole journey and and we love seeing you know our friends are sets a part of our family it's just been\nWonderful wow so there they were cheering you on the right to the finish line yup very cool so the the Sacramento radio station as you listened to his own correct six fifty yeah great station I was just with those guys the other day and break right folks and occasionally the broadcast as well\nAnd that was it that's all you that just listen to the ... and of course the book oh you're going to be all the money make as a okay and we also have a regular book too smart money markets all

right Justin and Sarah Sacramento, California area two hundred and twenty thousand dollars paid off that's their house\nAnd everything did it and two and a half years making two twenty to forty counted down let's Sarah dead three scream three two one\n[noise]\n[noise] very far [noise]\nWhy should I come from ... dot com you do not need a second mortgage to make your home over you can get brand new custom lines without paying customer prices from ... dot com always put in the promo code Ramsey and you'll see the best possible deal out there\nThese guys are great company blondes dot com she'll be in Illinois is it a good idea to pay for the coverage offered by the gas company and the phone company to cover the lines that run from my house\nTo the street if something were to happen we are not in a financial position to cover any repairs um\nNo I Would not pay for that and I would get in a financial position to cover the repairs it's called your emergency\nFund so you need to work your way out of that like we teach\nAnd that's maybe step to paying off everything but the house using the debt snowball and then from there\nOn once that's done once you're out of that everything but the house then we're going to build your emergency fund three to six months of expenses I Do not have any insurance on the things that run to my street on my house was not on any of them\nAnd if something breaks I Will just pay somebody to come out there and dig it up and fix it\nIt's that simple I Would I Do that while I Would use an emergency fund how did I get an emergency fund a didn't give people like this money [noise] so I had more money now are you taking a risk in the meantime yeah I mean you could something happen between now and the time you build it up but the point is get your financial act together\nAnd the weird thing is it causes you to end up with more money\nSo here's what's cool you ever hear the term the rich get richer the poor get poorer while there are several reasons for that\nAnd it's not all pressuring in capitalism is evil that's not a rich get richer the poor get poor because by and large poor people who do rich people stuff with money become rich people overtime\nRich people who the rich people stuff with money stay rich people rich\nPeople who do poor people stuff with money become poor people in other words it's about have you ever think\nIt's a set of habits a set of values are set of choices\nOther part is is when you do get your head above water and you get you know you get Murphy out in the street Sallie Mae has been affected you have more margin in your life and the weird thing is when you have more margin in your life you make more money let me give me an example when you have your emergency fund in place you can ... you can raise the duck doubles on your insurance\nSafely what happens to the premiums goes down you could not pay for gotcha insurance like these little\nYou know sewer line which or some such crap that's unbelievable no you don't put your money and stuff like that you're self insured for these kinds of things and the weird thing is emergency foot happening as soon as you get an emergency fund isn't that where this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\n\nAll it takes is one emergency trip to the dentist to blow your budget quickly now I'm not a fan of dental insurance I think it's a waste of money but there is another option it's called one dental and it's not dental insurance one dental as a discount program that functions like a membership clubs think of it like Costco you drawing\nOr anything like that so that's a big thing keeping costs down yeah that's what allows you to do this what other sports do you have for getting out of that [noise] well uh\nAge of of excuses you know everybody has an excuse for something and I got a lot of money with it [laughter] yeah I'm just you know don't make any excuses we've heard a million times you know oh well if we major income we could get edited or if we didn't have kids we could get edited the really anybody can do it I\nMean people loot of all all strike you know here\nYou know very cool yeah that's good that's a good

months that's their house and everything maybe a hundred a hundred and eight thousand dollar income counted down let's hear a debt free scream three to one where\nWe\nA place where there's also the Memphis area Hi Jacob how're you\nHey Dave I'm great how are you better than I deserve what's up\nI'm In my fiance and I were just looking for some guidance on some things I'm so we don't have very much that we've got about twelve thousand two hundred on a car that's worth about nine or should she got twenty six hundred in student loan debt and then we have our house mhm um we bring home between four dollars and I'm forty two hundred a month\nUm and she's looking [noise]\nShe's not really satisfied with their job a career path and she's\nDone a majority of our cars coursework to get an associate someone into the um about where that would fit into steps um\n'cause she makes ten Seventy two an hour right now part time but she gets forty hours a week with some benefit\nI'm ... and the programs that she's looking at\nA as a radiology attack which uh would take her about two years to get done and uh that's made us our ... year\nA lab technician more take about a year to get done with her current the stuff that would transpire and she'd be making thirty eight thousand after that or an HR specialist would take her about three years of a shout out of the last you know choice of hers to get done so\nWell you know we're not we're not that much debt and I just didn't know where we should focus on first ...\nWell the first thing is is I hear a wide variety of jobs elections here or course yeah she doesn't even\nTowards the red deck of their number one it's a really good program here in the local areas are short now\nYeah you know and I think I hear that you guys were analyzing her career only on the short term income\nUm what's your thinking long term she she right now she works in a HR 'em and truly enjoy the she just metal do want to be in ten years from now aside from income\nUm or type of man come she liked working with people and shoot she was really excited about the rat pack because we did a site there that are kind of a an orientation type thing and she really enjoyed the the teachers and the the facilities and the idea of working with people in that way so of the three I think that would be the best long term for her as\nMore and they don't have access to your program did you say Oh yes sir and will now at all\nIt would be around Nineteen thousand but that included in the remaining work but uh she would have to get our associates as well as the actual course work for the degree okay\nSaying is is we need Nineteen thousand dollars over the next two years plus we need a about Fifteen thousand debate that free over the next two years yeah so that's thirty five thousand over two years at Seventeen five a year and you make about a little over fifty\nA yes so I'm so like you can do Seventeen five a year to me and be free and pay cash for her school in two years\nOkay you've just got a cat or a glowing you got to map it out mapped the math out but um yeah I may have done something wrong and I was doing that but I don't think I did\nYeah no that sounds right um so he he plugging away at the death smart snowball and the short term and save up to pay cash for the right type program\nWell you can you ought to be all the cash flow the ... program is what I'm saying oh okay you need to look at I mean I I I think if she starts now and you figure out okay I got to save this much a month to stay out of one semester head up my payments right for that you got to get\nYou got to get that part moving and then once that's moving and then we start throwing money at the debt and you keep up with your monthly budget\nBasically your saves a set

better\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay um I Am contemplating going to a new job\nAnd my current I'm a nurse and that's his and um my current hospital offer to ensure held a life insurance policy\nThat I think it's about five hundred thousand um my new employer fair life insurance policy they offer is only one hundred thousand and I can't get it um otherwise I have some immunity orders and\nI just I get denied or I'd have an outrageously expensive\nPolicy and I just I'm trying to think outside the box that I'm not stuck in a job that happy because of this one issue yeah see I don't know how you're\nGoing to be making more at the other position\nIt'll be the same okay I'm going to be\nBetter I only have to drive ten minutes instead of an hour [laughter]\nI Wonder if the new place the new hospital or whoever has enough flexibility that they could have had some insurance programs to their group plan to allow you to buy more\nI asked about that and they said the man I spoke with said that it's at bundled package and he doesn't believe that that's the case\nMhm\nAnd I spoke with um our investor and he um he said he goes to buy your pet for well and he's about to manage bond account\nAnd uh that's not my principles\n[laughter] I've never heard of it out well I'm not gonna start buying bonds to offset the fact that you don't have insurance so it's not you know that's what he's doing and that no thank you um I mean you you need to build up a big pile of money called wells and then you don't have to worry about life insurance and that's the general principle that you move towards a or about\nTo pay our house off in December so they don't have any that um\nAnd so you know I and the more wealth you have a less and less we need to worry about replacing your income for the good of your family mhm right if you have enough oil that your family is fine and you have no bad and your family's fine without your income than we don't worry about this subject anymore because you become self insured\nYour family's fine 'cause the point is is the family needs your income to live\nRight on to the extent they don't need that just to the extent you don't need life insurance now have you actually shopped or are you making an assumption that you can't get insurance\nI got denied about seven years ago and I tried\nCalling called calls and their insurance and the market has changed dramatically\nWell I got another diagnosis back in March that when I looked up life insurance and this diagnosis that um they basically said you get to know but I haven't tried Zander\nTrying them I mean there's no it doesn't cost anything to ask mhm let's talk about it and found out that I don't I think you may be right I mean if you know you probably found some ... research and probably not enjoyable you know so the only question is just you know if your family only got a hundred grand instead of getting five hundred grand how old are you\nThirty eight\nAnd uh the auto immune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional um does do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nImmune that you've got I mean how are you know you're a health care professional um ... do you have a real threat here of losing your life\nYou can't they can't agree that in mind mild but I um when they hit record it kind of\nNon down by the actual facts you die and I am Lee is left without you what's the probability of that\nI don't know how they're going on and on and get help so I mean it could get worse ... how old are you thirty eight\nOkay so I mean in the next ten years a typical thirty eight year old would have very low probability short of an accident of passing away and yours is slightly greater resolve and it's not like to have a terminal cancer diagnosis right right okay so I'm not gonna worry about it I'm gonna take the job I Want\nAnd then use your fabulous income what you have to build wealth and to become debt free in the family but I mean if you're sitting there with a million dollars in mutual funds and your four one K. and mutual funds and everything's paid for house and everything and you passed away I think your husband can struggle through\nYeah I think you know and that's what I mean by self insured by becoming wealthy and about\nThree hundred thousand in retirement\nYou and your house is paying for him so and you get a hundred thousand and insurance so you know he is he gonna be okay yeah you'll be OK yeah plus I'm guessing he works right hey right yeah yeah so I mean he's going to be okay so I'm taking the job\nBecause the call Center for informational purposes and just double check your assumptions OK okay thank you thank you Michael is with us from Charlotte Hi Michael how are you\nGood thanks thanks for taking my call sure what's up\nUh so overall I'm trying to figure out whether or not to continue to build up my underfunded emergency fund or to pay off my car so I can give you a little bit of a back story\nWe teach people who we call the baby steps\nBaby after one is a thousand dollars All right I got\nThat anything above that goes on baby step to any other money goes on that anything except your home you lift your debt smallest the largest you attack that with a vengeance how much do you own your car\nOr Eighteen thousand in the car and I do have a mortgage also in how what's your household income sixty four fifty five other how fast you can pay off in Eighteen thousand dollar car pretty quick what's pretty quick\nUh All right now I'm just making the normal payment so fast to\nMake like sixty thousand are you going to pay Eighteen thousand do that math\nNine months yeah\nYou have no life you get the car paid off or you sell the car and move down more than two which you don't need to pay that much longer how old are you twenty four\nTwenty four and a [laughter]\nAlmost like I've done this before [laughter] okay yeah so you got a really expensive car and it's kicking you in the teeth so a payoff half the car right oh my God it's a really expensive car what is it worth\nA paid thirty and you make city\nIt was it was my graduation present to myself\nYeah I'm not a resident to yourself not a president it's turning my personal do myself is I'm going to ruin my life you know no that's another hasn't okay let's get this stupid thing paid off for let's get it together sold one of the two so you got nine months to pay it off with a thousand dollars you got any money saved other than a thousand dollars\nOr like curly with the company match I'm putting fifteenth out\nTo stop putting money in your four O. one K. and do you get this carpet off\nOkay and I'm putting three hundred dollars a month into an emergency fund\nStop doing that how much is emergency fund a approaching\nAnd I'm putting three hundred dollars a month and on emergency fund stopped doing the ... how much are merging safe on a approaching four thousand dollars correct okay take three of it out put it on the Eighteen you're down to one\nStop all savings and completely laying in completely focused and completely attack and pay this car if you are unwilling to do those things that we need to sell this car [noise] there so that I rented [noise]\n\nIf you're a business owner I Need you to listen up\nDid you know that more than half of teens today associate stress and worry with money half\n[laughter] yeah [laughter]\nIt's for singles should slide now you didn't miss yeah [laughter] yeah [laughter] oh doing\nThe arguing down on the on the after the ... after the wedding is over there you\nKnow I could make them a worst place to find a spouse I'll tell you that [laughter] that is awesome guys well since you are experts in indoctrinated through and through what do you tell people\nWhen they ask how you get out of debt you a hundred and fifty three thousand twenty three months no matter where you met that's not easy\nNo it's not I I think that they get fired with having to back it and having a plan together and then sticking to that plant every now\nAnd I'd say for for me I think that you know I just feel that we're wherever the willingly left and the fact that\nUm while\nBefore we met and I could look back at my financial history where I made bad decisions after we met and we got on them and we got on the plan separately we've we've never gone through those\nDumb decisions um we've never had to deal with those stupid purchases or we've never had to look at something that we've done as a couple and said that was dumb now we've got to fight back out of it you know\nYou're going to run on the way while you were single yeah absolutely [laughter] for you guys very very well done I Love it that is awesome it you're right that's a great story that's a great story gives me a whole new idea for a new product line\nAnd you go I think I think to one of the one the biggest thanks for for us is that um we found out about eight months ago that we are going to be having our first\nChild now [noise] so uh we we had about two months to go getting out of debt and we just hammered down to finish this off and I know my personal story my father passed away at a\nUh he was thirty six years old well our family in a pretty tight spot my mom a as such a hard worker hero the family\nHad many health problems which make money tough yeah so I get overwhelmed to think that our child will not ever know about that yeah well not ever know how that life is you know you know\nI'm sure you're I'm sure you you're a seemed about term life insurance through with that you know\nAs we were just listening to that [laughter] oh and the other thing for me is that when the Holy Spirit and not just you to do something and you don't have any debt you know what you do you do it\nTo the moon though I was talking about that the other day it's tough to serve two masters I tried a when you don't have another master in your life you only have one it's a lot easier\nNot try Jesus talked about that show will Don YouTube very very well done so proud of you I'm sure your families are two ... did you have more cheerleaders or ah

and step father went through it with us as well as highly mom and step father should we her mom and dad's gives me we were all in their kind of together so ah we've we've kind of grown through this and\nAnd just very goal oriented but go without a plan to just a dream so that's that's what that's what helped us\nTo Chris rubbing saying they're no good stuff love it love it well
