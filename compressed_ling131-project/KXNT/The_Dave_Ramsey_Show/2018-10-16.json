all of it was mine yeah unfortunately I'd Fifteen five and a vehicle and then a hundred and twenty seven thousand to good old Sallie Mae so wow how long have you guys\nBeen married three years three years and so shortly after marriage the two of you look at this pile of debt and something happened tell me what about your story\nWe were just kind of doing the normal thing and um we were actually started out on the the ten year forgiveness program and I actually heard you come across the radio um while I was driving around in my work truck ... and I'm just was always interested in finances but really never knew\nUm where to start or where to begin and we picked up on your program and within a few weeks I purchased a total moneymaker ever read the book I talk or and I said we got to get on this I said we're doing it all wrong and the and we started it out and uh she just kind of\nShe's in our word she didn't read the book really at all um and then eventually uh after I don't know about a year into the program she was starting to get mad at me because of the program and everything I said we just need to\nUm instead of yelling at me we need to go to the financial peace and then you can hear it from the source right from Dave ... and then you can yell at him he takes me on my back exactly\nYellow yell at the video guy yeah very cool okay so you got in there then and you saw it for yourself rather than just going oh the engineer knows the numbers you know because I kind of how it started right yeah the engineer guy he's going to do the numbers I'm the\nMedical personnel let him do the numbers and then you get in there and you see it for yourself so what happened when you went to the glass coordinator gave you a emotional ownership really in this thing\nSure I think it made it very tangible for me something that I can see and the the leaders of our class they were very open about their debt and how they had read it and that was something motivating for me\nFor me it felt like it was this constant uphill battle and on and I had this crazy burden 'cause it was all mine yeah it's a little bit of a guilt trip yeah ... and so that class honestly made me feel a little more support it and just give us the opportunity to truly jump in and know that actually getting out of debt was realistic\nWhen you first start Jim how do you do it this fast we uh there's a lot of debt and twenty I ... it was a long yeah it was hard we started the fast the very beginning of January in two thousand and sixteen now and uh it was\n... it was hard I mean two years and four months running and yeah and that's what that is a long long time but it's a hundred and forty three thousand dollars and you killed at all if yes how old are you too I'm too well we're both twenty eight and you're not even Thirty years old so some of these rockstar also millennials I talk about all the time [laughter]\nVery good good for you guys thinking well Tom are cool how does it feel\nNow that you've climbed the mountain is so great it's incredible [laughter]\nI think it's one of the best feelings it's nice to know that we can move on to the baby steps now and we just want to live and give like no one else one day so we're excited for us to keep travelling through the baby steps\nYeah woman you're making a hundred and fifty thousand bucks a year and not even Thirty years old and army payments in the world in life is pretty good [laughter] [laughter] yeah that's awesome so who are your biggest cheerleaders\nI think it was kind of each other and the very beginning we we didn't talk about it a whole lot um we kind of had some friends and families that were saying like what what are you doing and uh I think after we got\nRolling through the process and we were getting some traction paying off quite a bit of money ... are quite a bit of debt\nPeople started to come around now when you look at somebody go I've already paid off for a hundred thousand dollars a kind of shut them up you know absolutely yeah yeah it's like you don't have to shut up it just says it sounds good yeah that's great very cool you guys very very well done which the key to getting out of that\nFor us I think it was doing it together first of all the also being willing to work very hard I work three jobs and worked overtime but um and also never really strengthen the path I feel like once we decided to jump into the plan\nWe did not stray from that in honestly whenever I Would buy something like if I spent too much on groceries I Would feel bad because that was money that would be knocking on my ... now\nMhm yeah I gave you give your boundaries on a process you know what about you oh I think the\nThe the\nI\nIt was it was it was good I mean we we we were it was a key for him for you what was the main thing that got you out of debt you know work extra hours or the you raise your income over fifty thousand dollars\nAnd it's the residency program that is huge for her um she got a big raise and then\nYou know I Would I Would say call home and and be dispatch at the utility company and just uh the extra income any chance you could get extra overtime do it you know it really helps the snowball just plow through and go\nTo the finish line you know there's something about that because you're getting traction if he was working like that and you didn't know what if you're doing any good at it you you just be exhausted\nBut it's weird how it's exhilarating 'cause you know you're winning ... you know you work your butt off when you're winning absolutely and it changes everything and now you can crank back down to a normal people hours now and not have to be so crazy but if you want to go for something you know how to do it uses dolled up you know\nAnd the both of you have great careers and the ability to do that so\nVery cool very proud of y'all thank you think in graduations so proud of the Twenty years old sauce [laughter] amazing very cool well

Ramsey\nDave Ramsey dot com or bonds dot com you can't buy blondes and they rented a colon is on a day when you retire start making money from your investments is that income considered earn income or capital gains also aren't capital gains tax much lower than earned income\nOr that is not considered earn income it is considered investment income\nAnd it depends on what the money's invested in as to whether there'll be capital tax capital gains rate or tax on an ordinary income right if the investment is paying off on something that is less than a year old it will be at ordinary income if it's coming out of a traditional i._r._a. where it's never yet been taxed\nIt'll be on an ordinary income if it's coming out of a four O. one K. traditional not Ross it will be taxed at ordinary income as it comes out\nUm all of the money will be a hundred percent not just the returns because none of it the growth has never been taxed nor the money you put in has never been to act on a traditional so you'll pay ordinary income on those\nIf you have investments simply invested in these real estate you don't pay any taxes until you sell it and then you\nCapital gains portion you own investments like a a mutual fund or a low turnover mutual fund you'll have no taxes on that are virtually no taxes on that until you sell it and then you would have capital gains if you've held it over a year so that helps you can check your tax guy this is that I've Ramsey show [noise]\n\nIt's time to take another look at your budget that means scouring every expense and making sure you're not leaving any money

are than I deserve what's up well\nI'm excited that uh you know you and you of lead my wife and I on a on a clear path to a much better situation not that we were that are really rough spot but it feels a lot better being where we are now I'm In um [noise] we are a very quickly approaching the end of baby step three in January will be\nSix months plus and so my ah my focus now is four or five and six and reading your book and going through the class is actually more than one [laughter] and um\nWhen I'm really faced with is our house and he moved in and two thousand six and a we pay two fifty to a according to the low and you know casual conversation we're not we're not at the two fifty two so after you know twelve plus years were not back to our original ... you know purchase price [noise] um\nThat's weird yeah it no you know Phoenix got hit really hard by the housing bubble and we also I Know what ... really hard I'm Sorry I didn't know how to\nPeople even across the street or are you know have doubled the price of the house they bought a couple of years after we did we bought on the right side on the downside of the top but we're still not back there even a you know I guess maybe it's our neighborhood worse than others but [noise] um so we're not there yet\nAs we approach four or five and six steps four or five and six I'm you know I have two teenage sons were going to be faced with college here soon I'm very excited to get back into our retirement planning which we put on hold back at the beginning and so now I'm just trying to figure out if we just\nForget the house and not put anything well I'm\nThe editor in order of priority for five six but done simultaneously so the way that might sound would be you start with Fifteen Percent of your income going into retirement does by reason of war period\nUnless you're in an emergency situation you do that now I'm ... and then you move on to kids college you've got college looking down you're looking down the barrel gun on college\nAnd so that's probably going to make everything above and beyond your Fifteen Percent going into retirement and your rights houses probably on hold for a little while when you've got two teenagers and no college funds you got some catching up today right Yes sir\nOf Ramsey solutions sunny from San Diego California drop by and a half wash a sunny what's\nHi Mr Ramsey first of all it's such a great honor to speak to you um and my question is I'm just immigrated to the United states and I've lived\nA frugal life um saved my money them careful with it but since I've arrived in the United states um I've had my some of my acquaintances telling me\nI'm that you'll frugal living will make your social loud cost you if you buy an expense of law and expensive cars and all of the status symbol mhm are you will be treated as a social out Austin I'm came to understand what would your take on that\n[laughter] I Love it or did your emigrated from\nA United Kingdom United Kingdom okay and where did you grow up um I was born in India I immigrated to the u._k. when I was Seventeen okay and you're how old a twenty nine okay and how long did you live in a ... eleven years were you a social outcasts there um no [laughter]\nWell ah where did you live in the u._k. a city called ... off right pretty good size city it is it's it's a nice ... a a very legitimate shitty and you weren't a social outcasts there for being frugal now but um I was like oh what do you live in the United states um I live in San Diego\nThere it is [laughter]\nYou might be a social outcasts there now are getting okay there are people and certainly in San Diego that have\nCommon sense as well so um I don't know what crowd you're running with was there but um it's different than the one you ran with an India or the one you run with an baths for sure [noise] um because they have been bitten by the bug of consumerism but plenty of Americans um\nIn any city um will or not consider us social outcasts for having good common sense values now a that's assuming you're you know you if your clothes are not necessarily expensive but they are at least clean mhm and your watch um I'm I'm I'm worth\nWell over ten million dollars was building worth twenty million that you're standing in is paid for and that's my watch are pretty on assuming I'm like it costs about a hundred and fifty bucks\nI'm problem is I don't care what you think and if you think I feel like I'm cool goes I have a watch I don't think you're cool so um you know that's the thing you got to decide who you want to influence you\nUm and where you want to end up so what brought you to the United states why did you come here\nIt was um a childhood dream that I had ... um I read somewhere that um\nBecause it's going to guarantee freedoms to all people to Supreme Court had ruled that no one can be false to a recite the pledge of allegiance mhm and that's what got me I was about twelve years old ... and I try to apply that in my school and then get a get a naive I was ... I'm In real life\nYeah I did I listen to the principal and the fact that the principal one day when I make it to the United states you won't be able to do that to me anymore\nSo freedom that is correct freedom okay and now people are trying to take your freedom from you with ah forcing you to conform to something using a social pressure but not all okay and so I Would treat it exactly the same way as hard as you have fought\nThrough you know twenty nine years of your life to get to be standing here um I wouldn't surrender my freedom to stuff\nAre all in the name of someone being impressed generally speaking a here's a good rule of thumb people who are impressed by\nThings that you have or aware or not impressive people when you get inside of their hearts and inside of their minds they're what we would call shallow and so um the\nVery people you might attract by having some bling by having some jewelry or some watches or the proper\nClothing are the people that you really don't want influencing your future and your character in your life you've paid a huge\nPrice to get to be here and enjoy the freedom and so you're a man of character and um the uh ... and the show the people that are telling you that are probably not people I Would want\n'em to be influencing me I might want to influence them and try to help them but if I were in your your your shoes I Would say that doesn't need to be your inner circle that are teaching you how to live mentor and you decide billing you and so forth\nAnd so you know check out a folks that have a little more depth of character and aren't judging you based on what you drive now again it needs to be if you're driving a car um that's a while you're trying to achieve a financial go or something what needs to be clean\nAnd maintained you don't take good care of it but um it doesn't it doesn't need to be dirty and doesn't need to be missing the same thing with your clothing or your hair or whatever else you take care of the things that you have even and manage them but most wealthy people or do not by\nA expensive things to impress other people\nAre a few do but most don't that's how they became wealthy now they do by some expensive things that I buy some expensive things but there for me\nAnd for my family and for my wife and that kind of thing and they're not for what someone thinks I'm I'm I've got a really nice home but I didn't buy it for somebody else are we live there you know and what you think about are\nGood or bad doesn't really matter to me\nAnd so I I don't know is that helpful is that helpful part of the other is that what you were looking answer I think I needed to hear that now come what are you doing for a living and I look an ID in IT okay what do you do a a developer you're developing okay All right well you probably need to come to national work rush\n[laughter] Saudi as an honor to meet you sir if you've got quite a story brother quite a story well done thanks\nFor stopping by either open phones AAA eight to five five two to five ... this was the Dave Ramsey show D is with us in Atlanta Hi Dee how are you\n[noise] Hi I'm well thank you for asking sure what's up [noise]\nUm I wanted to ask if I should have my tax come here and she was quite a bit of information on our founding came Pakistan and India without being being charged that ten thousand dollars\nYou're being charge ten thousand dollars in penalties yeah mhm not taxes I Want to pay their taxes in penalty yeah okay\nLike a percentage on the information as well that\nFalse information she lied intentionally and you can't prove that\nYes why would she didn't\nGet to get back more money I don't know I think that she claimed that we have a business that we don't own she claimed that we're paying for cars that we don't own cheaply claims that we're paying 'em from mileage for their business again that we don't own\nThat's weird and mean does your husband have something to do with this\nWhen he doesn't have hit that we can see what you\nKnow I mean they just randomly\nOut of thin air she'd dreamed up a business that you don't have cars you don't have a knowledge that you don't have\nRight now we have a church but you know trickle down a path so they are with no there's nothing in them the documentation and Internet anything about the church that is our uh our number that they haven't won the number of them\nAre you are you doing a work outside the five oh one C. three as a venture list that you're being paid uh outside of the church now you know you don't do speaking engagements and get paid for that on the side\nYou know everything's through the church or a hundred percent\nYes and you know for they charge me don't make any money for the church if only if\nBoth work independently room another company\nI say you have your by a vocational pastors okay yeah okay um well I\nI think if there are I don't I don't know you need to see an attorney is the answer the question because I don't know whether you have grounds to sue someone or not this is a very bizarre thing\nThat someone would do this just out of the blue ... it's not a mirror mistake I mean it's a complete fabrication and so um I mean this was ... it sounds like fraudulent activity on your behalf now you signed the tax returns though\nDidn't you know every single day though\nYou know but you had to see the ... you you you didn't land I'll ask someone to send in tax returns are due to see Shirley Hi aid you may have trouble I don't know you need to see an attorney and asked them I my guess is the most you could hope to get back will be the penalties the taxes\nYou on the radio and you still owe the penalties are due to them not being paid on time due to this um and I think that's the most you might get back I don't know as soon as phony\n\n[noise]\nDid you know that if you combine that data breaches that have occurred in the past twelve months almost every American has had their personal info compromised or act over fifty percent of our listeners and viewers tell us that day or someone in their family has been a victim and Seventy percent of those folks have had\nA lot so I didn't see that being helpful but we had a unique opportunity with the car because we happen to own one of the Volkswagen diesel\nWas handle and\nYeah and they were offering us you know we can do the by Dr ... the pet and we were planning to keep it but I looked at the options and started looking at if we did the buyback and got the cash settlement got rid of the payment and the position that would put us in it it actually had us at that point to where we would pay off in thirty six months\nAnd so it about two or three o'clock in the morning I called my brother back on the phone from what I've been doing and he said he would buy us FDU\n'em for Christmas and allow us to you know do the program at home we kind of lives in the middle of nowhere and then I told him that I Would ... the next day or to talk to him and I was a little nervous because the car with kind of pets and I didn't think he'd\nGo you're going to any man that's driving the tractor\n[laughter]\nHe's like I'm not driving the minivan but yeah but he I texted him and surprisingly he was like most and I told them about my spreadsheet that I'd made this nice color coded spreadsheet and I sent it to him and surprisingly he came back with let's do this\nUm and\nI thought you were you were ready to ...\n... ... you know and then you come home and you will be Schumer city\nBut we didn't end up going to what we did it um through the program at home or go to our church is an hour and a half away and run and\nNot know nowadays you can watch it all on line from a very good you God is key to getting into that you know maybe one thousand may be much more ... more\nVotes like in the well they paid off the phone ten thousand\nOh the dollar cash settlement on top of that\nOkay so you got twenty five of the eighty one was that one month yes All right and then\nWhat what is the key to getting out of debt than you did it in Eighteen months\n[noise] um I Would have to say for for me it was communication close communication to where both of us know exactly what's going on with everything all the time rather than in\nThe past where I had largely let her kind of control everything\nMhm which she she didn't have as good a job as I could possibly expect\nExactly what she was by herself\nBut she was by herself I didn't have a full understanding of what was going on right how was being done exactly where we were I knew small numbers I did not have\nThe big picture and you know guys being visual creatures disparate she gave me the big picture and the color coded clarity\n[laughter] so it's definitely a huge last summer the control when I got involved but you gained um someone else's shoulders to help carry the load right\nYeah it became amazing actually what happened with pat with it was beyond fiber gasping because\nHe got so on board that what and and got on if we had a huge impact on this because he was told there'd be no more extensions and that was back like just a few months before we started at man I'm about to\nBe about a year into it\nHe gets a call ... he was home during one of his trip and he gets a call from work saying they had just gotten back three weeks before but they weren't having to combat that month early and he gets off the phone and he's like or do I do and I'm like\nI don't know they want to go back and he's like what what what are\nWe were out of town and I don't even know how I got my spreadsheet their numbers if I just knew that I sat down and he was sitting at my brother's house actually calculating\nAnd I'm like you know what if you do this\nWe can be out of debt in June\nUm instead of you know another year and a half and it was like wow I didn't think he jumped on board and he he actually told them that have extended for the the month you know if they would give them an extra two weeks on the end as well that would guarantee us to get it all paid off in that time\nAnd congratulations you guys were so proud you think you've got a copy of course organs returns from our book for you that is the next chapter in your story to be millionaires and outrageously generous as you\nGo along and going yet and I say one other thing that you got ten second regime was\nUm one of the big kids for me was um setting an example for our kids are teenagers and I thought they made a huge difference that\nPatrick ... definitely eighty one thousand dollars played all
