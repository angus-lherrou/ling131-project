everybody's so politically correct it's deplorable\nUnless you decide to actually speak your mind unless you decide to actually say the things you want to say otherwise you're a big fat sorry your bank hypocrite you're just a big hypocrite if you don't actually then go and say what you want if you don't go say what you want congratulations you're the politically correct\nPolice my daughter is retarded she has a disability she's defect yes that's what it is\nOh she's the special needs ... no that's not nothing distinguishing that's it's melting that's not defining what she is every child every child every child is a special needs child every kid has special needs that need attention\nAnd love and hugs and compliments and heading and training and helping every kid so don't minimize the severity of the problem my child has because she is in fact defective\nShe can't talk the way a six year olds supposed to talk and unless\nThe language gets correct did and we start saying I start saying I Can't say well you should do what I Need to do is say that she was retarded and effective and I do and the teachers are like whoa whoa we don't like to say that that's what it is\nYou stand with her in the playground you watch how the other six year olds deal with that child and you tell me if the problem is and profound and serious let's not make it all nice by saying she has special needs\nShe's not performing at an age appropriate level I'm [laughter] I Know no boys who perform at the age appropriate level well into their seventies\nThat's the fact\nAnd that's how I feel it's my phone number I live on a Sunday night my number's eight eight eight six say they doubled the whale the eight eight eight six eight eight\nNine to five eight I Believe that my daughter will get more honest help better help quicker help ...\nWe get her help she has two sessions a week with a private speech therapist she's in a a pre school she was in preschool that had amazing amazing help and support for her for her retardation\nAnd hurt defect that's what it is don't pretend\nThat that isn't what it is it doesn't help her to say oh she's a special needs child that doesn't help her that doesn't help her that does not highlight alarm blare out the severity of her problem\nTakes her out of the game she has all of these other tremendous abilities\nThat are minimize the minute she opens her mouth\nThe men did she starts talking people are distracted from how pretty she is how fast she is how athletic she is out charming she is a funny she is they have the world has to make a decision with her at any given time whether or not to do the work to engage with her\nThat's a big hurdle that's a high wall for another six year old to climb over what am I was six year old seven year olds do when they realize that my daughter has trouble speaking to them\nAs appear they make one of three decisions they are either very special and they engage and they do to work to be her friend but it's work six and seven year olds are not in the mood to do a lot of work\nOr if they come from a nice home they get quiet they get quiet\nOr they walk away\nMy child has a defect that's what it is and she's retarded that's what it is that language makes me love for more\nBecause it means that I have a lot of work to do as a father or mother has a lot of work to do as a mother but don't give me this crap about oh you know she's special my other kids are special to your special to\nWhen I hear all of the the the\nThe civics teachers on the radio doing their political theory about you know
