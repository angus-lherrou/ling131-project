generation is living in their mother's basement collecting participation trophy is it's just not true\nThere's a group of them that are but there is a group of 'em that are freaking rock stars too and

D. is with us in Sacramento, California Hi J. D. how are you\nHi Dave I'm good how are you\nBetter than I deserve what's up in your world\nThanks for taking my call and I'm calling with a question about mortgages my um my wife and I are debt free and we got baby step three eight I'm\nWorking on three B. and we just went through at the you know we coordinated it thank you and yeah and my ... ... we're near it said ten percent but I hear you on your show the twenty percent you'd prefer a hundred percent but if we can't get there than them one of those too so I'm just wondering what what makes the difference between ten and twenty percent\nOkay a good really really good question well like you said obviously a hundred percent down is our favorite mortgage\nOkay not one All right uh uh the end when somebody's buying a second home I pretty much slap my fist on the table and say don't buy a house unless you're gonna put down twenty percent on your second because you've got the equity coming out of the first one\nRight in a normal scenario on a first home it's okay to whatever you can put down and get into the house okay here's the reason twenty percent is advantageous\nIf you put twenty percent down you have what's called an eighty percent loan that are eighty percent loan to value ratio that allows you with the standard Fannie Mae conventional loan or for that matter with an F. ha loan to have no he em high ... private mortgage insurance\nWhich basically is insurance that pays the mortgage company money if they foreclose on un lose money on the foreclosure\nThere's reasons for it so it hasn't zero benefit to you under any circumstance it's only because they are taking more risk because they don't have good asset protection on the ratio you see what I'm saying\nOkay ... pm my insurance is about Seventy five dollars plus or minus a month per one hundred thousand borrowed\nSo you were in a couple of hundred thousand dollar mortgage he got a hundred and fifty to two hundred bucks a month NPR mile alone if you don't put down twenty percent so that's why we push people towards twenty percent but if you're on your first time home twenty percent can be a big difference\nVersus ten percent and so if you buy a Fifteen year fixed rate where the payments no more than a fourth of your take home pay with ten percent down and you get your mind on your first time that's not the end of the world and you can get rid of the ... when you pay the loans down to eighty percent of value\nBy buying an appraisal that the mortgage from an appraiser that the mortgage company a ... of\nAnd then they will drop the P. M. I. later after you get it pay down\nThere the fact that we're in fact in California where home prices are no fairly high compared to this country make any difference\nKnow it doesn't make a difference is still the same situation you don't get a pass on mathematics just 'cause you're in California they don't like okay I don't want your map doesn't count you know we don't do that so you still gotta use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the whole process market you're in the more difficult\nBut you still got to use common sense but uh but you know again you're anytime you're at the higher the whole process market you're in the more difficult this discussion because when you get all the way down to ... percent I'm not requiring twenty percent but you get to you get J. D. how it's much to your advantage to not have this thing to me I Am I\nYeah I mean because you are talking about three or four hundred thousand dollar loan I mean we're talking about some money per month to going out the window for insurance that's worth absolutely zero to you\nRight so that's what I'm trying to avoid here but it's not but it's so if you buy and you don't put down twenty percent then keep choking on that mortgage keep working your baby steps four five six simultaneous get that mortgage pay down and get that loan reset\nWith an appraiser land that's approved and then get that PMS drop so you're not doing pm after Twenty years\n'cause it just sucks it's just a horrible you know it's just but it's part of the ... and it's ... it's logical reason that they require it but it's just super expensive\nAnd it just as bad so you want to get out of it as soon as you can 'cause then you get to the business are really paying on your mortgage and not just wasted money but yeah I I you know we don't beat up on a first time homebuyer you don't baby step three B. for not putting down twenty percent\nUh the goal always is to become a hundred percent that free as fast as we can and not waste any money we don't have to waste that's what we that's the goal we'll ask well\nThose of us that are in tune with being smart anyway\nNick is with us in Chattanooga Hi Nick welcome to the

the pleasure to be speaking with you sir you too how can I help um yes we currently have a Nineteen year old um family friend that my son's best friend living with us he makes about\nDeclares Eighteen hundred a month and he has a car payment to twenty two cell phone which is about eighty bucks and for gas about a hundred bucks\nWe budget for the month we're just trying to kind of figure out we got more nimble system since he's late with us real fast his his wallet was basically his bank account he had no bank account yet\nI'm what I'm wanting to know is how do we go along and do the envelope system with budgeting has money and putting money away and trying to help and forgot what to do with all his excess\nOkay well I think you teach them how to do a budget and that's where every dollar has a name before the month begins right yeah I mean it sounds like it's a fairly primitive easy budget\nYeah there's not much that there are and like Thirteen hundred dollars only are\nYou know and let's get the car paid off and build up an emergency fund and go that route I'm that'll make sense but but um\nYou know we teaching these basic things that you and I both know about apparently you been doing this stuff that we talk about for a while in the hour we're going we're going to be on a budget we're going to avoid that we're going to build up an emergency savings and begin long term investing\nA wedding we're going to be generous with some of the money and uh so the whole thing that you get when you got someone that's living in a fairly primitive situation like this I mean no bank account\nYou know he's a young young guy getting started is that uh it's real easy for all that money to just disappear\nYeah and the egg thing you've got to get him doing is being intentional with every dollar\nOkay I'm a I'm In love she said yes we start out with\nUm I well I get a bank account going like you're talking about and a debit card for that and then you know I I think you just lay it out and say okay you know where do you want to be in five years and what other steps that are going to get you there and so you know how much are you going to spend on entertainment\nOkay how much are you going to spend on what's your take to keep your car running gas wise\nAnd your insurance and your car payment and then don't you take this income and give every dollar a name ride down the page I mean this is a one page budget you can do in about eight minutes you know yeah there's not there's not a lot to this deal is not like it's complicated\nOkay yeah we got some level of set up for like I'm a ... fine and the ... like a car like emergency fondness for you or your car stuff yeah I mean things we do have things going on about ten percent of his marine home we put in your savings why\nWell no I I Would I Would work the baby steps I mean not southern thousand dollars aside as my emergency fund and then after that I got his car paid off and then after that I'd have a fully funded emergency fond of three to six months of expenses in his case he be rich if he had no debt and five grand has bought five grand and savings wasn't it\nYeah it'd be really well off so\nOkay well then again I'm not then I Would start is investing long term start talking about a Roth IRA and those kinds of things and even start talking about maybe some additional saving so he can have his own place okay thank you very much a thank you for calling it Persia you're joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five to two\nOkay thank you very much\nLike thank you for calling it brings you you're joining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Vicky is with us in Wilmington North Carolina\nHi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] [noise] well I have a question about an inheritance [laughter] um my husband and I are small business owners and we have a significant amount of debt with the business and our personal which is a lot due to the business for ... years during the recession and five several years ago\nBut we have a twenty nine thousand dollar inheritance that we [noise] um [noise] my husband had to hope that we could use for the kids' college I have one daughter that's in her freshman year of college now and then another one that will be starting next fall and then two other teenagers and a baby so I'm\nSo this business of making money\nIt's struggling that it it makes many now but we still have um a good bit of debt from how much time as much profit\nUm profit uh\nGosh probably well\nI have to say probably doesn't make enough to support us over the past few years but I'm\nGoing to live in this mythology\n[laughter] um I don't know we every time he has said okay I Need to go find a job some there it's like that door closes and the business door stays open and um\nHis business doors not open it's not making enough to support your family mhm and so we need to set down on this business and give it a deadline that in the next six months it's going to start\nSupporting our family after all these years and making it up to start getting rid of some of his dad or we're going to close it\nAnd get a job because I don't think you're making any money\nUm am I wrong [noise] well\nI mean we pay ourselves from the business and when I was bringing home um about a hundred thousand a year\nBringing your you're taking a hundred thousand dollars out of the business yep well that'd be called profit okay you can't live on a hundred thousand dollars well we can we have a lot of how much that if you go\nWith the business has got fit about fifty two K. and we personally have about um Ninety six K [laughter]\nWere you in the business doesn't have any debt you son personally for it okay so that all his belly change you know it's like oh I'm dollars in debt and you have a hundred and you have a hundred and forty thousand dollars in debt and you make a hundred thousand dollars a year is that all you makes a hundred thousand or the that's what you're pulling out and then you make a profit to\nNo that's all we make that's what I mean\nWe are happening all income when you do your taxes is a right to pay\nIt has been that were made with an accountant to adjust some things there so that we're taking distribution instead all profit and\nThat doesn't change it right but that's how much we're ... we're paying ourselves from the business ... a year so you need to find out if you don't know what can\nYou can you give me three different answers you so you need to find out if you make if your business is making a hundred thousand dollars a year and you guys can't live on how does one of the year you got other problems\nRight yeah\nYou can pay off that making a hundred thousand dollars a year and work your way through it and know the twenty nine thousand dollars does not need to go the kids' college fund it needs to go clean up his dad go Michelle what might\nOkay but it ... the only way that makes sense is if you have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the property is\nYou have a system in a plan where you actually know if the business is making a profit and if it is making a profit what the profit is and it's all coming home to pay off these debts mhm or if you want to pay off the fifty two thousand at the business and call that business that I don't care but we need to be reducing debt\nRight quickly and aggressively and if you're making a hundred thousand dollars you you ought to be all do that but you guys aren't living on a plan to businesses now planning your personal lives on a plan I can tell by talking to you\nYeah I Know and we just got the ... in the mail today and we're like okay that's a good start ... and\nI'm going to send you a copy of the book entree leadership on the business side so uh because here's the thing you need to be going on I quit making a hundred thousand dollars a year that's a great business\nYou know I'm not going to quit that but what we are saying then is is that we can get fined tune in give I think you're good at making money I don't think you're as good at managing it and so we need to fine tune our systems at the business the profit and loss statements though\nThe budgets at the business and so we knew exactly\nWhere every dollar at the businesses going and exactly where it's coming from and then exactly what's coming home and what is taxable income\nAnd then lay out a game plan to pay off a hundred and forty two thousand dollars worth of that\nBetween these two different sets of debt\nAnd work your way through it you can do both and use the twenty nine thousand towards that go if you don't do that and you throw the twenty nine thousand that the goal and then you never pay off the debt it was kind of wasted wasn't it so I'm not asking you to blindly throw it at the debt distorted that I just thought of that and I thought of the debt and throwing a system at your business in a system\nIn detail budget at your home and all of that applied directly on this problem so the problem goes away and the twenty nine thousand is part of the solution to that\nBut the biggest part of the solution is really getting detailed and organized with the money at home and at work hold on I'm going to give me a copy of the book entree leadership and this is the day Ramsey show\n[noise]\n[noise]\n\nOkay things are getting pretty weird out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the

look curiously or like you were crazy or did you get more cheerleaders\nNo it was a little bit of both I mean our family is very supportive but for me the crazy part was that it was weird I I kind of took it took my blinders often realize that a lot of people are OK with with being in debt and taking on that and I'm like\nWhy you know like when we got to the store and get it in the beginning but people kept saying oh no just just go by that you know you know you can paid off soon no no no that's not how I Want her also for ... and you know obviously with\nWith our little guy here and in our

your money Dale is with us in Kansas City Hi Dale how are you\nFind it's like it's taking my call day sure what's up [noise] [noise] well I'm Wondering if I Need more life insurance that I have no care how much do you have I have about two hundred and fifty thousand okay what's your household income sorry what's\nYour household income a hundred and eighty what do you make a hundred and fifty okay\nAnd you have two hundred and fifty in life insurance and how much in your nest egg do you have in wealth um and investments\nAre more debt free of the home and land mhm and that's worth about one point eight mhm and then I have about four hundred thousand ... Ross\nOkay good and uh what do you owe on the land and home\nA five hundred and twenty okay All right\nWell the income produced off of six hundred and fifty thousand dollars less just use it that's the two fifty and the four hundred\nYou got those two numbers mhm if those two were invested in just rent round numbers just to make this easier if it was ten percent that'd be sixty five thousand dollars a year she doesn't get to keep the land in the house in that scenario does she\nKnow camp for service and a half a million dollar debt was sixty five thousand our income and raise kids right\nYes sir okay so you're under insured if your goal was for her to stay in that property upon your death now if she'd liquidated input seven hundred thousand\nThe equity of that ... two hundred thousand dollar house has five hundred in her hand plus has two fifty plus has four hundred now she's got over a million dollar she's got paid for two hundred thousand dollar house and she can live on a hundred thousand dollars a year then are coming off of a million one\nThat makes sense so if that's your plan you're okay but if you want her to stay on that property and continue to live there you don't have enough insurance do you see how I'm doing that\nYes are there okay so what's the goal which one\n\nWould you want her to stay on the lambs I Want her to stay on the land and she wants to stay on the land but I Would rather she would live close with us from family\nOkay and then if if you if you want the ability to do that we need um [noise] you know you need about a million five in insurance\nShould use five hundred a ... to pay off the property she'd have a million dollars and some change that way to live off the income from so somewhere a million million five and life insurance or your seven or fifty light at least be able to hit\nThat way to live off the income from so somewhere a million million five in life insurance or your seven or fifty light it and we used

they bought a universal life policy which is a type of cash value policy\nA portion of your premium folks when you're having universal policy goes to pay the insurance costs and the insurance is cost goes up every single year because it's based on annual renewable term rage and so more and more is going to insurance cost us the policy gets older less and less is going to the investment\nTo the point that they they cross the line a few years ago and contacted Sharon and her husband and said oh now the premium that you're paying one hundred percent of it won't cover the insurance costs so now if you want to keep the insurance not only is zero going to invest much\nBut now even more has to be paid to keep the insurance active and that's how far we got in the discussion is what I just shut all correct Sharon yeah yeah okay and what is the whole face amount of this policy eighty thousand eighty thousand dollars and they're much money do you all have\nHow much money do we have from\nYou how much you earn your four one K. and you know\nWe we did have retirement account how much they pay total eighty four thousand ...\nUm\nHave a ten thousand dollar emergency find we are dead prey or if a for good\nOkay and so you're living on Social Security and eighty thousand dollars worth of for my husband\nStill works his side he um had thirty six thousand in income and they'd rather than Twenty one out of an infectious parity okay and that's all I I don't\nGet you in the face of amount of this policy you said was eighty thousand dollars\nYeah come on and we did look into term insurance for him but number one it really a lot like I said I get paid but number two he has battled cancer a couple of times yeah non Hodgkin's lymphoma and so basically you know it was like yeah very difficult\nVery difficult but we don't know we we can lower the death benefit\nSo what is the premium how much is that a year\nIf I don't know how much Seventy seven a month yeah\nOkay it's eight hundred a year and you make thirty six thousand dollars a year\n[noise] um\nWell here's here's the equation here's the way it works in your mind okay what's the purpose of this is to give you an extra eighty thousand dollars\nIf he dies before you do okay and so is that war is eight hundred bucks at this stage it's there is no investment value whatsoever so we're not the only question is you know you you don't have a huge mistake\nOr that you you've got a small mistake in the show to double it basically if he were to die would be very helpful\nMhm and so keeping the insurance sounds really good with that in mind\nYeah they they told us that would only last about three or four years anyway and they sent me on it for me to\nAl ... and they're going to make you stop anyway they're going to pull the plug yeah oh yeah okay and at that point you catch it out and whatever cash value isn't there a ban\nIn [laughter] my husband would like to get it out now\nYeah more way to get it out no way to get out now as close a policy down right which I mean it at which which means that you would you know if he passes away you'd have the four oh one K. money it paid for house and be living on Social Security right\nYeah but you probably could make it goes I gotta feeling you guys were frugal people oh yeah and so you probably could make it on that but it's not going to be a dream come true um\n[noise] so they have given you notice that at I'm\nSixty two are are Armstrong Seventy three or whatever Seventy years old they are going to shut the policy down regardless\nYeah well I ... well no I guess if we can see paying enough that it would be over two hundred a month\nYeah I think we could have a guy that I'm kind of a or we we could lower that that benefit and and keep it going and they found if we could do that which is what I wanted to do it when the cash it out of them were doing nothing\nThere there's not a great answer okay that's why I'm human and hauling a little bit I'm trying to think through it [noise] um\nUh my tendency is an eight hundred bucks a year right now to keep it for a while mhm okay I'm Seventy seven dollars a month even if you use the cash value you can have the cash value is beginning to pay the premium\n... and ... you know it's going to do is going to use up some about a thousand dollars I'm probably going to do that\nAnd let the eight thousand dollars pay the premiums starting today and I'm probably going to leave it in place a couple of years when it starts being two hundred a month instead of Seventy seven months at that point I'm probably going to join his tribe and say let's cash it out mhm in close it down\nBut I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for\nA long long time we're probably don't keep a couple more years\nMhm and close it down but I don't think it's going to make sense to keep this long for a long long time we're probably gonna keep a couple more years houses health\nBut then I was his health oh\nI'm the first time I went to the fate cancer free for five years and that kind of a cancer free for two years good so I mean he goes and he gets a fair and every every six months of how to make sure it's not coming back of a graph of\nGood good I'm Glad to hear that ... ... ... ... I'm gonna I'm gonna let the a cash value pay the premiums for the next two years and keep it open\nIf a ... and I'm going to check on his health at that time let's say that he's got another episode with cancer going of that time then you pay the premium no matter what it costs\nAnd you keep it open and if he if he's being if the cancers come back at any stage right you can't you keep putting open at that point but if he's doing really really good and everything's clean and two years from now you haven't seen a spot nothing's no problems anywhere I'm I'm probably dropping it at that point okay\nThat makes sense to me it wouldn't it wouldn't be insured so\nYeah you know but I'm not you but but you're also not paying you know three thousand two thousand dollars a year which is what is going to be at that point yeah which is starting to be ridiculous with that kind of money you could throw money into a investments to start having some money\nAnd uh but but at this stage I I'm\nI'm hesitant to cancel it it's it's obviously a bad policy it's obviously had thing but it's your only option you're stuck with this now that makes it hard to discuss it hard to think about but I'm going to hold it two years about the cash value pay at at the end of that time if he's healthy or instill cancer free I'm dropping\nIt otherwise I'm going to keep it if it's if he's got a health issue at that time so good question thank you for calling in and I'm Sorry you had this problem folks you hear me yell and scream about cash value life insurance will live life insurance universal library but life is rip off you just experienced it\nYou just experienced the back end\nWhat happens if you buy one of those pieces of crap policy\nAnd you're sixty eight years old this is what happens because the money they put into that stupid but policy\nWill be three hundred grand right now in mutual funds if they put it into that in a good investment instead of getting ripped off by the insurance company and if she was sitting there were three hundred grand plus the other four one K. I'd have about four hundred thousand bucks plus\nTheir house is paid for she wouldn't even called me\nBut instead guess who's fat sassy instead of her insurance company\nSo when your whole life agent says I don't really agree with Dave Ramsey because your whole life agents trying to rip you off\nThat's why your whole life agency and that and there's only two kinds of whole life agents ignorant and crooked does if you understand these numbers and that story right there and then you still sell this stuff that makes you crooked\nYou ought to be ashamed of yourself if you don't understand these numbers and you're still selling their stuff that makes you ignorant\nAnd you shouldn't be selling this stuff and by the way folks in case you didn't know you'll get screwed ... way more often by an enthusiast enthusiastic ignoramus than you will by a con artist so most of the people out there selling this\nAre enthusiastic ignoramus as they're not actual con artist mogul Charlie so with Israelis and enthusiastic ignoramus that's all uncle Charlie we just nailed him right there does he probably not a crook if he'd actually sat down and looked and realize that sharing your if your friend shares\nUncle Charlie would just melding right there does he's probably not a crook if he'd actually sat down and looked and realize that share your if your friend if shares brand sold her that he's not afraid of uh friends like that you don't need enemies [noise]\nYou know good at three hundred grand and mutual funds easy for them what they dumped into this crappy product alive life insurance

journeys on you know some other people are we even got to poke fun a little bay or ... and basically now my friends or anything like that it's they don't they don't say anything now\nAnd I guess not

diligent went there and stay on track yeah\nEven when you see when you grew up I mean I can be the one to be the most uh as all my idea of what I Want something or I like stuff so [laughter] I always like\nThe most expensive thing and then you don't want to put the biggest fuss about waiting or you know being patient the hardest thing no\nWell you dinner for seven years you lived like no one else

the way okay\nThat's the only who are I Robert analysis in Hartford, Connecticut two hundred and sixty one thousand dollars paid off that's their house and everything but I was thirty two years old seven and a half years it took them making eighty to two hundred a year counted down let's zero did three scream\nI boy those go\nWell then you guys very very well\nDone I Love it\nSarah is with us in Ann Arbor Michigan Sarah how are you\nI'm great thanks for taking my call they sure what's up\nSo I have a question about um some of the movement tree that final parts of the baby steps\nWe currently are added that um [noise] we are a we have our emergency fund that's fully funded we're currently cash flowing to kids in college and um so it's about retirement versus our house pay off we currently oh about I'm Seventy eight thousand dollars on our home\nGood and what's your household income uh just under two hundred thousand a year from them and how much is college\nOn our kids are about forty thousand dollars a year right now for the two of them no good good good help from doing that so my question as it currently have about seven hundred and twenty thousand dollars in our retirement accounts my husband's company doesn't match that we do Fifteen Percent not a problem mhm\nMy company I'm very blessed with 'em I invest five percent may give me ten mhm [noise] so that's the fifteenth\nSo my question is do I find a different way to invest that other Fifteen Percent or the other ten percent to make mine a Fifteen or do we put that extra it's about three hundred and eighty dollars a month towards our mortgage\nIt's four thousand dollars a year mhm doing much better\nI saw that sure well I mean you know you're acting like that mix\nIt doesn't matter\nWhere you know how they share it you know your act like that makes a dent in your mortgage it doesn't\nAnd it would make it much better and retirement account you know\nSo I I Want you to put a baby step for Fifteen Percent of your household income you\nPut Fifteen Percent of your household into I'm into retirement it doesn't sound to me like you're doing that right now\nNo I haven't been really hot and then you know I think that's a little product is putting my height and they put in a timely amazing match you\nKnow it's wonderful match love the match or not going to lose the match we're going to do ten percent somewhere else like you said in Roth IRAs we can do it during the four oh one gave you got good options if it's raw four one K. particularly I Would do that but I I I Would be putting Fifteen Percent of my income away in the return to the point is you're going to pay off this house\nAnyway\nRight at really the exact same speed\nBecause four thousand dollars is what's going to get Seventy eight thousand dollars paid off\nWhat's going to get some of the eight thousand are paid off when you got to concentrate on it when you go a little bit of a bonus a tiny little inheritance or you just squeeze some money out of your budget but it this three hundred dollar deal here is not\nThat that doesn't move the needle towards getting house paid off the house is going to get paid off 'cause you buys you guys have been concentrating and focusing in probably what's going to happen is when the kids would get kids off to roll you probably just gonna finish up the house and like that year a cause that forty you'll be down to about forty\nBy then and then that year you'll just knock it out so um you're ... you're doing really good obviously I mean you're doing really really good overall but I'm going to do ten percent you put a Fifteen Percent but that other ten percent in in their retirement\nAnd then after baby step for five your cash flowing sixes and everything else we can find reasonably within the budget to pay extra [noise]\nOne question I get asked all the time is do I need life\nInsurance listened the whole point of life insurance is to replace your income for someone
