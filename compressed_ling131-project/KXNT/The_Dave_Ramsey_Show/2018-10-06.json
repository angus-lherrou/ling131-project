M. K. U. T. [noise]\nFrom like eight to five five to to drop and we'll talk about your life\nAnd your money Taylor's with us in Hartford, Connecticut my Taylor how are you good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nOr just you know first of all thanks so much for her to call him and looking for like eight years now um and I had a question regarding retirement and college when my one year old mhm\nI'm I'm I'm Thirty years old I'm among baby steps for about a thousand dollars in cash mhm um I Know that other than my house\nUm which has about a hundred and twenty thousand dollars left on I'm On a third year mortgage and when I bought it I could Ninety thousand dollars down on me so I have no equity in it\nUm and I am about fourteen thousand coming in as a gift for my one year old college fund um [noise] so I'm going to be putting that into a chip five twenty nine I think for him in and out some\nGrow dot mutual fund to I don't know your clothes from their real good um so my question is what are kind of my\nSeven hundred dollars um my wife stays at home with their child so I'm pretty much the only income right now [laughter]\nSo I wanted to keep you know a good portion of that set aside and just cash and then I don't want to know what to do with the rats shake shack draw towards my how they do that every year or should I put it someplace\nElse we teach Taylor is a process we can all the baby steps and it tells you what to do at different phases of your financial plan and as you lay the foundation then as you build a house and you put the roof on your financial plan it tells you each time what to do and what to do first what to do second and so forth\nSo I'm the baby steps one is thousand dollars you've done that too was dead free but the home you've done that three is an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses\nUm and that's going to be nine to Eighteen thousand dollars in your case\nAnd so uh twenty thousand dollar emergency fund is adequate as adjusted emergency fund in cash okay then that brings us to baby steps four or five and six and we do those simultaneously for is putting Fifteen Percent of your income into your retirement plans now uh what do you make\n'em so I'm about Seventy eight year\nIs the household income yeah yeah okay All right and uh do you have a four one K. at work\nYou know I have a any tension um that I put a about a hundred and thirty dollars every two weeks into it\nUm so I didn't know how that kind of played in the cards as well\nOkay is that mandatory\nOkay All right I probably would not count that it's a fairly small amount of money and I probably still would put Fifteen Percent aside Fifteen Percent of Seventy thousands and thousand five hundred okay and that would be a around eight hundred and fifty bucks a month going into something do you have a four one K. available at work you don't\nKnow I have a I currently have I just opened up a ... or re ... with a better man which is one of the oil and high hunters for me I'm familiar\nWith what I Would do instead is I Would use I'm a ... a\nPerson that as an advisor today a robo are coming there they're they're doing pretty good but none of 'em are strong enough yet that I'm willing to go there I've not got any of my money in robocalls at this stage of the game\nThere'll be a time and a place that those things evolve to the point that they're probably going to be a good thing to do with some or you know in certain situations and so forth but\nWhat I Would do just go to smart faster at Dave Ramsey dot com click on the smart vest or pro link and it'll drop down a list of people in your area that are that we recommend I'm not in the investment business so I don't care what you do okay I don't affect my income at all\nBut I people have always ask me who do you recommend recommend people that have the heart of a teacher that will sit down with you you and your argument you you're married\nMarried um and have a Thirteen month old\nOkay so you and your wife can do a fifty five hundred each uh unless you're over fifty years old and but that gets you there are fifty five hundred as eleven thousand then that'd be fully funded ... and I would have those in gross stock mutual funds\nI spread Mayan personal investments across four types of growth stocks mutual funds that's also what I recommend and I put a fourth in growth in income uh fourth and growth a fourth and aggressive growth and a fourth in international\nNow once you're doing that and you know the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that\nNow once you're doing that and you have the monthly draft coming out of your checking account you shouldn't need any of the Seventy thousand dollars to do that with\nYou've already dumped a ton and your kids four five oh five twenty nine and you've got it and mutual funds that you're watching which is just fine\nOkay I just be watching that you could you could review that with a smart rest or pro and see if you know if they teach you anything that makes you want to move it but you may want to just leave it where it is that's fine there's no issue there um\nAnd then everything above that and that's baby steps three is fit or babysit for Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement\nFive is address kids' college and it's different in ... in you know how many kids how old they are and that kind of thing so we don't have a balance on that but you're addressing it\nAnd then once you're putting your to Roth IRAs and you're doing your Fifteen Percent\nAbove that everything I can find in my budget uh any extra money I come into I'll throw it at the house doesn't want to get the house paid off that's baby steps six when the house is paid off that leads you to the last maybe step and that's max out all retirement and invest invest invest give give give and become very wealthy\nOr what you will do especially when you get rid of your house payment so all of that to say I'm probably going about fifty grand out of your Seventy at your house\nAnd then I'm going to set up those two Roth IRAs and any other money I find that my budget um all the ski jumping around that house you're probably going to the house paid off in three or four years at this right\nThat's what it sounds like to me and that's the direction I Would go Josh is with us in Arlington, Virginia Hi Josh how are you\nI Do I'm great how are you doing sir better than I deserve what's up\nAlready so I have a currently two hundred and twenty three thousand a hundred and Ninety three thousand it's pretty normal it's currently with the U.S department of treasury um it as a result of having been additional from a service academy or three years ago\nUm and that the remaining thirty case like a pretty normal debt I'm obviously much smaller so my question is\nI'm I'm familiar with the baby steps I'm a I'm a huge fan of yours I've followed you for a while um should I continue\nPaying off the smallest at first or should I I'm just kind of start to save rapidly but a hundred and Ninety three thousand um reason I ask is I Believe it's going to go actually I Know for a fact that will eventually end up any collections account if I'm not able to pay the amount that fall I'm\nYeah I'm In what is your income now so\nIt varies um last year uh I I made a hundred and Ninety thousand um I I got married this year so combined income between me and my wife um should be this year at least a about a hundred and a hundred and fifty thousand on it's gone down a little bit this year my also\nWow so you might learn if you guys are on the Internet um side and so what I'm going to just put this on her Ninety three and the debt snowball and knock it out as fast as I can 'cause you got wonderful income you'll be different two years\nIt's not going to collections okay\nWhen you start someone thirty thousand bucks this thing or it's going to go away really really fast you make a lot of money you're not getting a real tight budget and clean up the mess so I I Am never heard of this I'm curious about to learn something you went to a service academy one of the military academies\nGot this enrolled and they charge you for all the tuition\nYes or so yeah a little known fact that you're just an old I'm pretty much under any circumstance following junior year you're either ask that served through in the service or you're assigned to the recruitment and death um and it goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not paid as it goes over to the U.S\nSo you have the option of serving\nIt goes to the defense finance and accounting service initially and if it if it's not it it it goes over to the U.S\nTreasury so you have the option of serving as an enlisted person if you get this enrolled for a period of time and it's for given\nA yes or however my case I was not afforded that option I I was given an honorable discharge half the pay back\nSo like West Point as an example you can get hammered with this I did not know that you have to learn something wow well the only good news in this story as you make a lot of money so you can clean up the mess quickly [noise]\nA common theme around here is teaching people how to make smart choices whether it's with your money or with your business you have\nEvery has you know but it can happen and can I have no ...\nAbout everything child rearing financially and everything in a bi ever had you know but it can happen and can I add one I saw what happens\nIs is that she's got to stay plugged into a properly balanced medication regime and hand it plugged into counseling she has to want to be well\nYeah and if she does that then she can\nForm a very good life and we have folks do that but to the extent that a bipolar person doesn't do those two things you are never going to have a financial situation is solid yeah because when they go manic they just go bananas\nOh I Know I Know that I was in control of her checking account for most of her life and because of that I was able to gather enough money when she was working and she was able to buy a car a couple of years ago\nBut that never allows her to be anything except dependent upon you\nAll right I actually last January took myself you know of of her checking am because\nHeart when you've got your boyfriend got involved more friends obviously not a bright boy so um\nHe was doing drugs yeah well we know and and so he wasn't in his right mind I rest\nMy case you got so [laughter] so bottom line is what I Would do if I'm her mom is I Want to participate in her healing financially emotionally getting back on track so that she can be a good mom to this baby and have a good life\nAnd make good decisions independent from drug addicts and independent for mom of initially\nBut if you can get her back I I don't want you to set up a checking account and you manage everything and not be perpetual but to do that was yeah I mean but to do that to get her back up and running again with the idea that you know we're going to hold the back of the seat until you learn to ride the bike and then we're going to let go of the seat again\nBut you let go of the seat last time not because she was healthy but because she was unhealthy yeah\nAnd I'd like to get her up and running in healthy you know we got the meds worked out we got the counseling it's for the rest of her life\nShe's got to balance that stuff but I Do see if she doesn't she go hit the bridge every time man and be back in my office or in your home trashed again financially here we are again broke you know and it's just I'm\n... but the good news is I I hear a lot of hopelessness around bipolar because it's so frustrating\nFor the people that have it and those that love them but the good news is I have seen a innumerable number of people that with a quality spiritual walk quality counseling and the proper amount of medication some people over medicated some people say you don't need medication I don't believe in either one of\nThem now she has to leave the medicated that she does she's the type of person she goes nuts if she's not medicate\nWell there's you you don't want them just you know you know fall the rest of their life is\nI mean they had control their she'd only as a ward of the state and we got her diagnosis when she was sixteen yeah uh as as as a mentally ill and she is voices if she's not on a couple of different minutes she does\nHer ... her only shot then is what we're talking about but our goal is this girl to be forty four and all this to be a memory\nCan happen yeah and it happens to people all the time\nSo what did she say right now when they call her\nOn the on the show you get nothing so she does take up the phone you know you might as well but I wouldn't ...\nShe say right now when they call\nIt an so you get nothing so she does take up the phone\nYou know you might as well but I wouldn't have long conversations with them because you just you know because they're going to just I don't think I should be talking ... telling them either one of the I'm not going to long conversation it's got nothing you get nothing because\nAll they're going to badger her and that's not ... the situation now once you've got a little money and some jobs going then we start negotiating and trying to work our way through the death right\nWell my head I think that it just goes on a year or two it they will eventually come back and want to negotiate\nAnd I are going to negotiate after two months oh really yeah okay I think it's been longer than that I think it's been at least six months\nAgo there were there during ... today but she's got no money and you're not giving or any you know so they get\nNothing they get nothing today now\nSix months from now she's balanced on her meds taking care of the baby working still living under your roof you can give her the emotional support you can put your arm around her and walk with her as she fights through dealing with these nasty people go collectors\nAnd let's say any show show a little bit here Thirteen entered their eight and get there they say look it can we work at a deal\nYeah or you know they got Thirteen hundred bucks you've ever seen any money in two years I'm no backup and working again I got five hundred dollars if you'll take that in the settlement in full will do it and get an in writing and no electronic access\nTo your checking account 'cause whatever these collector say you can tell they're lying if their mouth is moving it's a filthy industry so you got a free somewhat rattlesnakes 'cause they are [noise] you gotta really tender covering person here who's going into a rattlesnake then she starts making some money\nYou got a warm weather emotionally on there\nBut you can you can give us a cheerleading ... without giving them money and I think you're right to do all of that there's good news show she can make it out is she makes a good choices\n\nOkay things are getting ... out there I thought the Equifax breach was bad enough it exposes the personal
