[noise]\nThanks for joining us America mark as a ... type mark how're you [noise]\nWhen they trap pushing the button again there we go hey mark how are you [noise] I'm fine and yourself better than I deserve what's up\nWell the reason I'm calling today to talk about bankruptcy so my wife and I combined we have about a hundred and thirty four thousand dollar than that I'm\nA hundred thousand new student loan and the balance will be a credit card debt we recently met with a financial advisor and they suggested that we filed for bankruptcy because they would take us a long time to pay off the bat they suggested that saying that it will be\nBetter for us to start fresh and I just wanted a second opinion what is your household income sure oh combined it's about eighty five okay you have any car debt\n... mhm oh no we don't our cars are paid off okay what are your car's worth oh\nI Would say about twenty thousand combined okay right\nWell here's the fact that the quote unquote financial advisor didn't know um apparently or he wouldn't have given you such stupid but advice student loans are not bankrupt double\n\nYeah we did talk about that during the conversation they never go away but he was a big um entirely because of the amount of credit card that we have\nFound to Mike or ability and really have to wait a minute wait a minute this moron suggested your bankrupt with thirty four thousand dollars with a credit card debt with a household income\nThirty four thousand dollars where the credit card debt with a household income of eighty five thousand\nThat's absurd dude that's what I was thinking\nThat's absurd does the ... that is a hundred thousand dollars for a student loan doesn't change anything because it's going to be there regardless if it's not a very reputable so we're dealing with you're going to file bankrupt jumped thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five no you should pay it off in one year\nAnd a near\nYeah one year live on safety paid off in one year take six extra jobs sell so much stuff you can't breathe\nYou know eating out no vacations and you're a hundred percent debt free in one year what are your car's worth\nYeah I'll call the work world corner\nOK each\nUm her to a newer model over oh they're so\nProud of hours or who are hers is worth what about Thirteen thousand mine is about ...\nMhm okay\nWell um you can do what you want to do I if I woke up in your shoes I have to tell you I've worked with families that were in dire straits over the years that were forced into bankruptcy you're not one of those\nIf you choose to file bankruptcy just cause you to dead young lazy to address the situation let's say even say you did it over two years it's only Seventeen five a year\nAnd your debt free other than your student loan which I'm not talking about the student loans will be gone in one year I'm Talking about the credit card debt and be gone in one year\nSo how fast do normal people that call the Dave Ramsey show that work our plan pay off a hundred and thirty four thousand dollars making eighty five about four years probably\n... yeah\nThat's the normal routine for people around here that would be student loans and everything and um you know I I Would not move down in car initially\nOut of your wife's car into a into a six thousand dollar or five thousand dollar car initially I might end up doing that as we go along we'll see how it goes what do you do for a living sir\nI'm operations manager\nI'm okay and what does she do for a living\nThrough the past the\nOkay All right cool um does she ever do any outside speaking for money\nI'm no windows wider but that's about it\nGun or does she do speaking Miami's does she speak on Sunday mornings\nYes he does very well be designed to\nOkay All right I mean I Wonder if if you know she might\nSell do some ... occasionally for somebody that was ill or on sabbatical or something in that congregation pay or a little bit or maybe she works in an evangelist to outrage and they pay or a little bit for speaking skills or maybe dot dot dot you do something I don't know I mean if you add ten Fifteen thousand dollars a year to this equation\nOf income and you guys tightened down your budget to nothing I mean nothing where you have no life because we're going to clean this mess up you know you can clean up\nThe whole thing in four years maybe three but four for sure\nUh any clerical student loans really really really fast as a part of that equation I'm Sorry though that credit card debt as a part of that equation really really fast but you've got to cut them up you've got to quit using them and you've got to stop living the way you been living goes it's not working agreed\nOn despair is that makes sense yeah something like that\nThe Bible says that no discipline scene\nThere's just not working agreed\nOn was where does that make sense yeah for like for you know\nThe Bible says that no discipline seems pleasant\nAt the time\nBut it yields a harvest of righteousness\nYou guys make good money so I Know you're not stupid people you're not ... they're not dumb you just been doing some dumb things which makes you just like most of it was added a lot of dumb things in my lab dude a lot of money in particular as high end up teaching is because I got a P. H. D. and D. U. N. B.\nUm you know if\nI don't I don't know who it was they gave you this advice but you need to stay away from them\nAs they gave you really really bad advice that's my opinion I think you can not only can work through this I think you should work through this I think it'll be a testimony to God's power and you're all his life that you turn this around and that you attack at an attack at an attack at and that you could start having a sense of self control the sense of discipline\nAnd it'll change your marriage um communication levels it will lower the stress when you're working the plan they gather\nIn you can do anything how old are you guys\nA cue twenty eight I'm I just turned thirty two\nExcellent show when you're thirty six and she's thirty two year debt free as I feel\nSorry for the life no vacation with no eating out for a short period of time\nFor a short period of time you live like no one else so that later you can live and give like no one else I think about what how much how much money you would have and how well the you could become and how generous you could be if you didn't have any payments right now\nOh my gosh\nLike about the peace that would be in your house the stress that would be going to say it it's worth it to pay a price to win but there's a price to be paid do as a project that you got\nYour own home and you don't get out of a whole by jumping out usually you climb out\nScratching and clawing pool and dirt on to your fingernails you know what I'm saying you can do this man I'll help you I'll help you I Want you to go through our non weight class on how to handle money and I'm going to pay for it it's called financial peace university\nYou hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we'll get you and your your wife signed up I'll show you how to not filed bankruptcy you are not bankrupt not even close thanks for the call\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five you joined us America we're glad you are here Robin follows me on Twitter at Dave Ramsey which is wise or David lump sum pension\nAnd a roll over our\nMonthly annuity checks\nOn a lump sum and rolling it directly to an IRA where there's no taxes in good growth stock mutual funds\nThat will cause you to make more money monthly than the monthly annuity check would have been because it is based on a lower rate of return than the mutual fund should perform at and when\nYou die with a pinch and the money's gone then it goes to pinch and have and not\nThe your heirs\nWhen you roll or take the lump sum and you roll it over and an Iranian die [noise]\nStill there when you die [noise] goes to your heirs so the you make a higher rate of return while you're alive and they one hundred percent higher rate of return when you die [noise]\nThere's a piece of money in our age they're there for your face [noise] always be some rollovers mutual funds\nThere's a decent money is an outrage they'll they're so you're saying [noise] always some good mutual funds that transfer into [noise] good IRA so that with mutual so they don't have any taxes [noise]\n\n\n\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care if the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just get rid of it they're horrible they\nAnd I mean again and we do need to go crazy on kids cars here the ... the thing is I don't want you to move down and relax the pressure to figure out is there a way to get the income backup I Want you to look down and keep the pressure on\nRelax the pressure to figure out is there a way to get the income backup I Want you to look down and keep the pressure on is there a way to get the income back up just for the fun of it because you know what are you right now may and ensure fun to make it again\nExactly in the house we're moving into to me is not step down the beautiful house that I mean it it's a house that everyone would love to live and it's you know I'm not going to be able to see the sun come up with the Atlantic every morning but I can live without that\nYeah and ... and again it doesn't have to be permanent and it's not like oh it's a great house so we're just going to relax I that's the thing I don't want to do here I don't want to just accept defeat\nI don't mind moving down you know pulling back to get back behind the wall and but now we're going to fight again we're back behind the wall you know we we can you know we're not taking fire were not you know we've got we're back undercover again okay would retreat enough to get undercover in the battle but we're not gonna as we're not going to surrender\nTo the to that we want to take that ground back again someday\nBut for today are for the next two years or whatever it takes to turn it around absolutely I make this move definitely make that move it all sounds very logical to me good question all ride Derek to others in Phoenix, Arizona Hi Derek welcome to the day Ramsey show\nFailing donors honor to talk to you have you too sir how can I help\nYou while you're telling a money maker of a book or just changed our lives I got it as a wedding gift and it was the best wedding gift we implemented it\nAnd pay off twenty two thousand dollars a day and eight months and then that ... free sense so it's been awesome good um my question to you need your help with this because sometimes I feel like I'm controlled by fearing over thinking when you quit your day job which is good\nTo go full time entrepreneur\nDo you have the full time job or do you have the entrepreneur gig running\n[noise] yeah that's what my wife does she sells the clothing for the ... um [noise] and she's doing very good at it and so I work for a local government here in town a mechanic just trying to figure out when that time is to leave that retirement and benefits the security\nYou wouldn't believe it was her the mechanics thing to sell women's clothing yes full because she are you already involved in the business\nShe's a she's been selling it for a year and a half um she's she's killing it she she makes in one week would I make a gross in a month as a mechanic mhm um so I wouldn't be going fulltime helping her with in Boise and shipping in the back office stuff while she sells all the dresses skirts\nMhm okay and and what do you make a make fifty two thousand a year\nYou can hire somebody cheaper and fifty two thousand dollars a year to work in the back off a ship and stuff\nWould that be the the best route to go as\nWell at least ten okay you walk away from fifty in order to do a job you could have hired somebody for twenty to do\nThat can be a short\nWhile she she grows says she's gross two hundred ten thousand so far this year\nI don't care what she groceries okay unless you're going to add more to her business in savings okay or in revenue than what you are making now then it's not making sense\nOkay 'cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't at three hundred and then\nNo yeah she's\nOkay\n'cause grossing two hundred and ten is fine as long as your expenses aren't three hundred and ten\nNo yeah\nShe's got costs of goods sold out of that that's not profit we're talking about there\nYeah ... is is around a hundred thousand out of that she's going to have taxable income of a hundred K. and she needs somebody to do are shipping\nShe need a lot of helps you were working to fulltime jobs that were working from eight AM to kinda eleven twelve sometimes mhm okay\nSo the question then becomes what are you gonna add not can you quit okay so it's just a business perspective because the other thing to scare me here is if if this thing a ... out on you\nThen you're both out of work if you quit yes if it flamed out on you if the fad the ashes on this particular clothing line five years from today is this thing still operating this multi level they All right\nUh well we're I guess you'd call multi level\nMarketing and I would call it it's a network marketing thing your recruiting people\nKnow that's that's the misnomer a that's a misconception of ... I buy wholesale financial retail just like a discount tire store buys Michelin or Cooper Tires I you don't ... you don't recruit people\nValue can but yeah you can\nAlso okay so seriously on it [noise] um no I I Would hire somebody to do the shipping for twenty thousand first and then when it gets so big\nAnd you're making so much money [noise]\nThat that you can't see the failing the money and you want to quit and then that's fine but right now I think you're caught up in the high\nDesert Iran's you show\nLet me tell you a story about two families that are very much alike and a lot of ways both families have two working parents in a couple of young kids each is dead and the struggle to make ends meet but they're starting to make headway with their budgets and smarter decisions with money\nThey have dreams and plans and the only real differences that one family is the right amount of term life insurance and the other doesn't\nBig difference if one of the parents die\nAnd that does happen their wellbeing would be destroyed\nPaying for the mortgage utilities food and other bills would be impossible let alone saving for education or retirement that's why every day I talk relentlessly about getting term life insurance just go to Sandra insurance dot com or called eight hundred three\nFive six forty two eighty two and see how inexpensive it really is the the family that takes those deliberate steps to be different and responsible\nIt really does make you the hero of your story and it puts you on course for better things ahead\nThis Halloween you can find treats for everybody at Walgreens like the princess it only likes cats or the superhero who's allergic to peanuts [noise] even the which to try to sneak more imminent when nobody's looking to find the traits that are perfect for them all at Walgreens with great prices and easy and easy out it's All right here now through October\nThirty first select Mars regularly and Hershey candy back or buy one get one\nFree shot for your Halloween treats today won't gains tested since Ninety now one [noise]\nI'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments at Quicken Loans\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list and I get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com apple on your smartphone\nFor anywhere\nHey Sean Spicer gave the midterm elections are approaching any anticipation is building with each passing day President Trump in full stumped traveling the country and campaigning for his fellow Republicans in Congress it goes without saying there's a lot on the line when Americans go to the polls on November sex\nThat they the latest news and information by describing to our new podcast everything's going to be All right it's available now on radio dot com I tuned or wherever you go to download your cat\nThat everything's going to be alright described today don't miss out\nI'm voting in the mid term elections because my ...

we're at the point it means a paint and flooring and you're living in it no no um well we were living in a mobile home um but then we got this offer to live in this house basically for free and he pays a live here and take care of\nI got that okay so that's ... so you've never lived in this other house no okay it's gonna be tough to sell it and the conditions than yeah\nThey can't get financing on it right so you're going to take a whipping a what will it take money wise to finish it\nUm\nWhat never had a professional answer on that but probably about eight thousand ten thousand dollar\nYeah and what is your household income um well my husband he worked forty hours a week what her household income [laughter]\n\nProbably thirty seven thousand a year\nOkay so your husband's the only one working well we have a business um it doesn't make it out again running but it doesn't make money\nHis income is about twenty seven thousand in the business makes about Fifteen thousand nearly okay and then during the care taking convictions or will be making about forty eight hundred\nCash but we get housing for free\nYeah I got up or until you get into if he decides he doesn't want you to care take anymore and then you don't have housing for free anymore that's right so I mean he could walk into more and fired you pretty much I changed my mind and then you have a housing issue again right right so um\nYou have any idea what the house you have shorter built would bring as it is\nOh well we had a appraisal and if it were completed it would be about a hundred and sixty thousand smart completed so probably a hundred and fifty hundred and forty five\nNo no not if it's not completed it won't know um\nBecause you you it's a further discounts and the cost it takes to complete it it's a lot further discount because basically the typical consumer cannot bothers house\nOkay because they don't have any money and they're trying to get a mortgage and they can't get a mortgage on those files\nSo that limits your in but they didn't limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that um\nThe south and so that limits your invent that limit your selling pool to investors and they're going to discount that a lot deeper than that if you get a hundred out of there should be flying I'm thinking so um [noise] how much will be borrowed against it so far\nThe house itself we owe thirty thousand but they're from property attached to a tell all the gathering a hundred thousand\nYou owe a hundred thousand against the house and the property yeah which would bring a hundred and sixty if it were fixed if you sold the property is well\nYes okay alright\nYeah I I Would look at trying to pick up the other ten thousand dollars in an additional loan and get this house finished and let's get it so as soon as possible\nAnd then just continue tanning money in Cali yeah\nYeah we all have you know you should have some equity in your pocket at that point I mean I'm not a ton but you're going to get a little money out of it so you know it it just hasn't worked out for you you realize that right yeah\nYou've got way too many hours in this house and and really didn't get much out of it went all the smoke clears here right you'll get a little bit but it's not it is not worked out very good so you know you're going to have to reset that and then the second thing I'm going to tell you as you guys need to look at your income\nBecause your household income as you I'm very very low income and ah so I I Want to think about careers what can we do to get our income up long term and I want to think about some part time jobs in the meantime\nBut um yeah I Would get that house finished up I'm saving scratching and clawing painting and [noise]\nYou know if you borrow three thousand bucks or something that's fine but let's let's turn around and get it sold as fast as possible now if the land is such that you can sell off a piece of the land without selling the house in order to have the money to finish the house that's what I Would do first\n... showing acre also corner use that money to finish the house then get the household and that way there's no more debt involved Olivia is with us in Lexington high Olivia how are you\nGoing to hire you better than I deserve what's up [noise]\nAnd I had a question and I had it can it can amount of debt and I'm I'm wanting to pay that off the air that right [noise] and then I saw in ... and ... and and that is going to therapy so [noise]\nAnd I use your income ... budget and\nPet therapy at the end it likely not going to get aid and how kind of scared to quit that I'm not really sure way to put it in the budget for how big of a priority like\nHow long have you been clean and have any kind of\nGood for you well then what is it\nActually addiction and an older\nCat well no I'm not going to therapy on hold right now this is something you need you need some accounts were to walk with you as you finish this life transformation and that that is essential to you having a life would you agree with that statement\n[laughter] now what I Would do is is number one it's not a permanent situation\nUm the therapies not permanent is not going to be there the rest of your life fifty years from now you're not gonna still be going to the therapist okay I Hope I'm and then uh otherwise there is just not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the ...\nAnd then uh otherwise therapist is not very good [laughter] but ah at some point you'll you'll pull back from that and the second thing will happen is is that as you continue to address your income injure outgo you're going to find ways to make more income and as you have more emotional healing\nYou're going to feel more energized to make more income and so if this month\nYou don't pay any extra on the debt ... therapy good\nIf next month the same thing happens okay\nBut by this time next year we ought to be making more money right let's do something let's kick our life in gear and let's start to clean up the mess to but for today Seventy five whole days you been clean\n[laughter] that's a great start\nRight but it's not like you told me you've been clean for two years\nMhm by the time you're going for two years we ought to be have different having a different conversation about the money would that make sense to you [noise] so let's get Hugh healed and then let's see all your money and as you and it's not going to be suddenly\nLike a switch flips and you go okay I'm okay now I've got the money no smog all or nothing can be gradual it'll be incremental you'll feel better you you know when you're\nNinety Days or years four months you ought to feel different than you feel right now and you ought to be able to do more and make more and save more and more and you know you're you all have more focus on the money 'cause you'll be more healed and\nHave to spend less severe emotional energy just coming through this right now your game on just getting through this is that right [laughter] okay well I Want you to finish turning the corner you turn the corner you're finished turned the corner and let's let's gone out and then as you\nMake incremental progress move more and more than money from your new income and your increased income to\nThe debt shot for today we want to take care of Libya you need to be taken care of and you're doing a good job on your show brought up this is the director\nShow [noise]\n\nHow often do you look at your bank account and wonder where all your money went how often or you're stressed about bills and afraid your paycheck will last the whole month you shouldn't have to live like that you shouldn't feel powerless over your money and you don't have to you can take control of your money\nUm and ... those uh you know that those things that we really thought it was sort of a macabre is opening thing up because we were starting to do things right and really what I see now is that he was preparing us through what was what was about to come which is that we have a we have three boys the youngest is ten months [noise]\nAnd uh our youngest has downs syndrome\nAnd so uh right now we're actually coordinating the legacy journey class at our church\nAnd we're just getting to the part where we're working on whales and so because we have this special needs a issue we we get involved or attorney and getting our wheels together good and through that conversation we uh you\nKnow I'm a we've been discussing a special needs trust or world I'd have to play in planning for our baby's future yeah you know I'm\nSure uh originally a kind of had that chalked up in my mind is that that special needs stress kind of function the same way with the other boys have a college fund in baby steps five\nUm the uh and that we would you know we'd be saving for all three of them but the one would have some some special conditions with special rules because of course\nAh you know his his features are boring it's too early to know what is your fully what his needs are we've been blessed that he's [laughter]\nHe's healthy developing well you know there's this guy to limit for him just like anyone mhm um and we don't have to uh uh you know it's hard to really didn't know if he ever have any limitations [laughter]\nBut uh but now as we're as I'm getting into it and we haven't find anything quite yet but it would come down to the wire why things that I'm uncomfortable with is that you know if I start investing any money or finding try I I lose control of that to the trustee that we've named and while while I trust the ... the inability to go with their wishes that makes me uncomfortable\nNo you don't you don't need a special needs trust unless both of you die right the special needs trust does not need to be funded prior to your dad okay so that\nThey don't want it sounded from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay and it's not ... I wouldn't even have it\nDon diets haunted from your wealth or your life insurance until you've got wealth\nOkay\nAnd it's not ... I wouldn't even have it formed except upon both deaths both of you dying okay as long as I Want to have you with a live as long as one of us alive to manage your ass that's one of the things you're going to do is care\nFor this child that flew out of those assets now that the when the trust is needed is if both of you die it gives the trustee me the\nThe the the direction on how to handle the assets and disperse them to take care of this child's needs\nAnd um and what that needs to be is a a big hairy term life insurance policy that drought that is the beneficiary of it is that special needs trust or a portion of the policy you know thirty percent or twenty percent of the policy and the beneficiary line goes to the special needs trust\nIn the event that both of you die kind of a thing where the primary beneficiary is your wife okay but then past that the secondary beneficiary is\nSome portion would go while you've got minor children into a family trust to take care of the minor children your oldest two until they get them through college the other portion would go into the special needs trust to perpetually care for this other child throughout life\nNot just through college and so it's a larger amount needed to do that and then what happens is let's say we fast forward Twenty years\nAnd this child is Twenty years old and you've got a million and a half dollars in mutual funds\nOK mhm your other children are grown and gone or close Twenty years from now right that's the dream the dream that law yeah we're kicking them out so they're going [laughter] that's the legacy by [laughter] but it's out of that than what we've got is we've\nGot you know some portion of my million and a half dollars I'm In my example is gonna be parked in the special needs trust in the event both you and your wife or to pass the rest of it would go to your ... more traditional airs directly\nTo her but you know we put a million dollars in a in the the youngest child ... special needs trust at Twenty years old because he's going to need care and that's eighty thousand dollars a year it'll produce that'll take care of him and may be one of his brothers is the trustee\nBy them you know would you would you build it had like we're doing right now would you formula trust as illegal activity now and we've been unfunded or would not let it would have would make it a clause in in the ...\nI Would just make it a clause in the will to be formed upon\nBoth of your deaths okay because you don't need it now you don't need to be filing tax returns for the next twenty five years on this thing you don't need a shirt that all the time you don't need to go all the legal expense to form a trust so let me give you another example okay ... as a as a special conditional\nVersion of just taking care of minor children right then the differences that might be perpetual okay but you know my children grew up and moved out on her own their own show my need for a trust to cover my minor\nChildren in a in a live in both of our best expires at I formed a trust for my minor children at that time in the need for that expire\nAnd I would have done it for nothing in this case is not going to be ... you're going to need a trust for most of that but I wouldn't be doing it until you die only mess when you have it on the phone down in the ...\nThat's what I Would do everyone and that's that's how we do\nI get asked all the time about what people need to do to improve their families money situation to the most overlooked things are term life insurance and disability insurance both plans make sure that you have income to pay bills\nAnd take care of yourself and your family if something were to happen for term life you need to carry tend to twelve times your income and I

M. i.'s law\nMhm you know just like you and your face the amount of I don't get down to ... percent\nNo you're you're you're not turning your two broke to buying a house you're in day out okay you're in debt you get your borrowing against your retirement I mean you're straining every corner to pull this off okay um and besides that you if you're moving from an eight Seventy five rental to six hundred dollar payment you're moving down in the house substantially\nSo we're going to move down and how substantially moved down to a different rental and let me tell you if the rental market is squeezed because of a plant that has come in the buying marketed squeezed as well\nSo what you're telling me is not logical you're using this as a rationalization to buy out of order I if I were you when you call me and I ask what you should do it I Would rent something else move out of that rental moved to a cheaper rental that'd be fine\nAh for a short period of time that while you clean up your debt your debt free you build your emergency phoned up three to six months of expenses then you have a good down payment and you can do all of that in a few years if you're careful and watch what you're doing and then make your purchase\nBut when you buy a house in your broke you're asking for trouble I mean a Murphy will move in your spare bedroom bring his three cousins broke desperate and stupid owning a home when you're broke and be a financial curse\nRather than a blessing\nSteven is in Virginia Beach Hi Stephen how are you\nI'm doing pretty good how are you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI just wanted to know what would be smarter to deal with right now I have a ... and my name and I know you can only put five thousand five hundred into a year yesterday hypothetically at me and my wife only had\nThat ... that amount of money five thousand five hundred it go toward the investing whether it be smarter to put all of it into my rock IRA out there or should I open up a rock for my in my wife's name and I split the five thousand five hundred and put two thousand seven hundred and fifty in each of them and watch it grow that way\nWhat's your household income or a household income at fifty thousand okay All right\nSo Fifteen Percent of that going in it baby step forward into retirement is more like\nA ten thousand no it would be more like Seventy five hundred okay um [noise]\nSo you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter\n[noise] um [noise]\nAnd so you wouldn't fully fund to but you could put some it it doesn't matter uh which one you do mathematically let's say you chose the exact same mutual fund and you put\nThree thousand in more than three thousand in another okay one in one Roth IRA and your name one Roth IRA and her name or or um you put six thousand in the same mutual fund it's going to grow exactly the same so it doesn't matter\nUh he'll I even had like a thousand dollars I can I could open up ... ... ... five hundred in my name and five hundred her the exact\nExactly it doesn't it doesn't have you any mathematical advantage whatsoever [noise] the only advantage is just a relational in that if she feels like that you know you're fully funding yours and she's not going to be paying for retirement which is not true because if you ever got divorced or died or anything else\nShe's gonna get half of that money even if it is and your name\nOkay okay so it's not true but sometimes people just you know like she just wants some and her name that's okay so you can do half and half if you want you need to get to the point you're putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement that's maybe step for and that would be after you were out of debt and after you had your emergency fund them ...\nWhich may be why\nYou don't have the money right now\nThat's why we put baby step for after getting out of that and after having emergency if we'd do folks temporarily not to save for retirement until you clear your dad's that way you have the money to put Fifteen Percent away\nAnd a Fifteen Percent is more than one Roth I'm ready for you guys but conceptually if you just even if you did Seventy five hundred\nThirty seven or fifty bucks each ah that'd be fine or if you did fifty five hundred and two thousand and the other name that's fine if they're in the same mutual fund you're going to get the exact same results whether you split it or not doesn't change a thing James is with us in Fort Smith Arkansas Hi James how are you\nGood thank you for taking my call sure what's up\nMy wife and I are planning to buy a home next year and have a little trouble deciding or for agreeing on the house would not want to get ... up online and towards getting a fixer upper\nThere'll be a cheaper house with lower mortgage payment ... and that gives me the opportunity to learn learn how to do those holler payers myself\nMhm and she lets say moving ready house\nMhm okay and uh be your first phone\nThat they are sick at all and we had a house for a while ago and then we moved in with an rent printing for well over a year now you know\nThe other home that you had was at a fixer upper it was not it was ... ... ... and um so what is her fear\nOr it's just more of a ticket you know and it kind of a hassle to pick up the house ... ...\nDidn't want anything major just you know just some minor cosmetic type stuff\nBut I couldn't you do it for you moved in\nA financial aid I'll think we'd be able to afford rent and a mortgage\nNo I'm saying oh yeah okay so what you're saying that you use a fixer upper would take a few months maybe and you wouldn't have time to do that I got you\nI'm a part time real estate agent of I live in a house for two years and then

breaches or being reported every\nProbably would go to my wife is she still living would would continue to receive a lesser amount that's probably because I could take I can take you there is no survivor and probably get more\nYeah but are you healthy yes\nI Would take it as no survivor getting more and by Fifteen year level term insurance to cover your wife if something happened to you it's a better deal yeah go ahead and take all the money you can get you know\nOkay I currently have a four hundred thousand dollar term policy so\nOkay yeah then that she's probably All right without the survivor benefit because\nThat's going to replace your forty thousand dollars that you wouldn't have the she wouldn't have if your dad okay that that that are invested ... percent will be forty grand so that that's pretty good\nYou're in good shape and you can probably do it this way um I Can't jump up and down and say you're in great shape\nYou're you're in a way above average shape I'm In good shape is is is way above normal 'cause normal just sucks okay you gotta way better than most people but I'm living on forty thousand dollars a year for the rest of your life for the next forty years is going to get old\nAnd you don't really have any income coming other than that because your investments aren't big enough to create it and so I Would you know you can do it you can do it but I think you need to have in the back of your head you may be going back to work at some point\nI'm considered that I've thought about it for health insurance and um [noise] um and I've heard of these mega share programs do you\nSee how we reward is not driving this for me for what's driving it for me is you don't have much\nMoney right and you got the pension but I understand you know think about what what are\nYou know forty thousand dollars is going to buy in forty years when you are Ninety\nNothing yeah nothing\nThat's the problem with a guy out here so it doesn't have a good long term prognosis of you guys just being able to live and we can figure out how you could live in other words if you had a million dollars a mutual funds this\nBecomes like a no brainer\nInstead you got like a hundred and fifty two hundred thousand maybe if we scrape everything together after the sale the rental properties and you know the farms got value but it's not producing any money so what my what I'm thinking as an ... and again you can do whatever you want to I'm just talking it through with you OK\nI'm not saying you're you're you're you're wrong or you're bad or something but that's my concern of what I'm hearing\nIs and so I probably would think about what we always called an encore career and say what could you do that would be really fun\nThat you could make fifty grand or a hundred grand doing for the next five or six seven years and you didn't enjoy doing it start a business you'd have fun doing it and make some bank and bank all of it and\nHealth insurance as part of the deal I don't care if you're working for somebody else she started a business but just do something what you're doing out and make you smile anymore so you need to get out of there\n[laughter] you picked up on that her\nYeah and so you know but I but I mean when you're you're young you have a lot of uh a lot of\nTo humanity left inside of you that you could get paid for ideas concepts things you could do I don't know what it is but it's something that just I mean I I'm just a little bit older than you I'm fifty seven and do and I plan on work\nAnd it's not 'cause I Need money I don't need the money I got money coming to my ears but uh I'm working because I have a blast\nYou ought to find something like that and then you can work in hunt and fish\nI got money coming in my ears but I'm working because I have a vast\nYou ought to find something like that and then you can work in hunt and fish and worked in the hunt and fish and farm and you know\nBut but you know I'd like to see your bank another five or six hundred grand and the next eight years and have fun doing it that's what I'm saying that's a that's a the only challenge I've got is I think there's God's got something inside of you there's something you could do more the hunting and fishing that\nNot that that's what people are by this law you've earned the right to do that and you should get out of the place you're getting outta but what's your encore career you take a bow and you come back out to the stage for the encore that's what the encore career as a lot of people in like a lot of money on that Richard\nSo and and it's not that money's everything but I I just want you to have a little more ad between you and Murphy then this scenario gives me here\nAnd I think there's some magic left inside of you\nThat we all need still that's what I'm saying and it might be you take a year and you do nothing behind fishing farm and then you say at the end of that year I'm going to go to ... and that's okay but but Ninety for for the next forty years you're going to get tired of fishing [laughter]\nYou know bottom fishing [laughter] so find something makes you smile when you do that's all I'm saying so uh I'm gonna send you a copy of a book that like you know when George called start because you're starting a fresh\nChapter I don't think you'll enjoy the Ninety recalling him sort of alter your shirt [laughter]
