there's a lot or in the mail offering cash payout retirement anyway they don't let her have it for the person at the present value\nAt ... normal retirement annuity mhm I've heard to advise people on the path to pay the tax payout\nMet my concern is that there was that we've noticed that now that that the state treasurer um pet said that the pension plan had weakening financially\nAnd that kind of

there are about five steps too complicated to do here on the air okay but basically you can put in the amount of payments you would receive and put in an average death age of\nUh Seventy six for a male Seventy eight for a female\n... that's how they're calculated typically on actuarial tables\nAnd uh then you figure out what the president value of those payments are because that's what you're going to receive and that's what they're saying that they're offering you and it's probably the discount rate is the interest rate and it's probably six percent five and a half percent something like that so you probably make five and a half\nPercent on your money and if you die you lose it when you die not if you do when you die you lose no you're right and so if you took the lump sum you'd be

Know the bill or loan forgiveness programs but I'm just trying to figure out\nA loan programs don't work there ten years long you don't want to be in depth in years what's your household income\nSo take home between my wife and I we um we make ... about it\nAnd so if you put twenty thousand dollars a year on these is going to take you five years so I think I think you've got to look at ways to increase your income\nOkay you've got a lot of student loans for two teachers\nOr do we do where did you get your degrees\nOr so she has her masters I got my bachelor's receive we we vote for in a few northern Arizona university\nWow you must have put everything on their um [noise]\nThank you for Levis with those in Atlanta Georgia are welcome to the Ramsey show Levi\nDrawing that are not as Irma was up\nNow I have a job and I'm making making about forty thousand a year [laughter]\nMaking making about forty two thousand a year and [noise] um well I got another job offer for thirty three\nUh-huh and\nUh the only reason I'm considering it is because the the benefits are a lot better mhm um they offer for one came or paid holidays more vacation um they also pay one hundred percent of my health insurance from\nOld is your health insurance costs now\nI don't have any I Can't afford any mhm okay oh okay the company that I'm In company I'm with now it's it's like five hundred dollars a month or something just for me mhm mhm\nSo hundred dollars or five hundred dollars a month or six thousand dollars a year you're talking about taking a pay cut of nine thousand dollars mhm you're going to trade six for non\nIf you're doing it for health insurance four one K. benefit ... worth very little and the other benefits and you know more time off is not what you need you need more money\nMhm well that and the potential to grow with that company would be a lot more\nQuickly I'm I'm within the next year or two what'd you double your income on wouldn't quite know but now a quick which will be like I couldn't I couldn't be looking at and the next two years I can be looking at like maybe [noise] maybe another ten thousand a year back up to where you were\nUm yes plus the health insurance yeah yeah\nWell the the benefits are worth very very little in this equation um I Would not do it for the benefits\nOkay I might do it if it's taking one step back and I get into a career I Love shark and take six steps forward 'cause I Want to or how old are you a twenty three so the question is when you're forty three Twenty years from today\nMhm does this take you where you want to go Twenty years from today\nIf it's not telling you in that direction then you're doing this for health insurance benefits and that's a dumb idea\nOkay [noise] um I mean maybe maybe not this job or in mind I don't I don't know exactly how are you not only that much about the company quite yet but it it does open the door for for the [noise] it's uh it it it can turn it could help transition me into the career I Want to\nBe what do you want to be it is I Want to be a master diesel tech okay what do you do now I'm a welder\nOkay and what do you need to do to become a master diesel tech\nI Need to get my ... I Need to get all my diesel certifications\nOkay what's the shortest quickest way to do that\nOr at least will tell you that I Know a good mix along going forward to ... do a good diesel tech makes a lot more than forty two right\nOh yeah yeah I can be looking at like a hundred grand a year\nAnd that's what I was thinking okay so what's the shortest path there again we've got to get on the search how do you get the search um\nCommute or a technical school I guess at a at the only way I Know\nWhat's it like once you get into a company that would put me through the school\nDay you got what's the other hand like you're talking about working ... what's the other place you're talking about working what do they do\nUm they actually may work on a big or um or\nEighteen wheelers and trailers and stuff like that\nWhat kind of work that they do diesel that\nYeah they have them they have them there and stuff I Would just buy would be coming in and a different position to be coming in as a welder\nWilder and they'll pay for you to get your search and in three years you're doing sort of a ... sort of hard work and you go from thirty three doing hundreds then nobody gives a crap about health insurance we just tripled your income dude and you're doing what you want to do\nAnd in three years you're doing sort of ... certified work and you go from thirty three to a hundred then nobody gives a crap about health insurance we just tripled your income dude and you're doing what you want to do\nYeah now that's a plan\nSo there were three hours in the interview if you like it you say gently and kindly with a smile if you want me health insurance is not the carrot to dangle quickly getting made the search says the carrot to dangle and this rabbit will be going\nOkay but I Need a plan I Need to know you can start to search what you do you work in a year before will pay for your search okay I'm In I'll take I'll take a pay cut for a year to get where I Want to go by the time I'm forty three\nOkay but I'm not just taken a pay cut 'cause you gave me a little bit of lame oh health insurance okay wrong wrong motivator you follow me\n... yeah I I get ... you might you might want to ... percent chance soil\nSo Jack Jack in a nice way lovingly negotiate with them jak 'em up and go do you got you a new welder if you pay for my search when can I start\nWhen we were in charge you for a year okay you got your new welder where you put it in riding your bike from a short starting in a year and then figure out how long it's gonna take you to get through those search and then

to new on far graduated he thought it was on the book and I went and certainly and until I found I went to college in April\nAnd after we got married but we struggle with this thing motivating hum I tried he identified yet undo every dollar in fact I didn't write and by that but then I don't listen to every day more and more of them I found out of every dollar um but it's it's a struggle balance thing um\nI guess they really married and mining all her stuff and then continuing to try to stay on a Monday and we've been ran into my neck of a leg up on the phone with that\nUm that is how I'm trying to learn how to continue to my right hand and it and want to continue on to call that disagreement that family which\nGoes well\nThe thing is is Jesus said you're treasures where your heart is you know when you agree on your spending\nAnd you agree on your financial goals you really agreeing on your new lean your new marriages value system you're agreeing on as a couple our fears\nOur

got married thirty five years ago they used to tell us the hardest year of marriage was the first year\nJust like us on the follow us on Twitter on the news talk gate forty AM in the\nCaitlin is on the line in Denver high tailing how are you\nPaying games thank you for taking my call I think Kelly for taking\nSure on my quest and like [laughter] like cutting into my husband started his own painting ...\nDigits a few months ago and he's gotten some pretty big contracts but his label ability to work day and like it's a way to go up there by [noise]\nAnd so we're trying to hire somebody but we're not having a hard time finding good and reliable employees in the industry because it usually is rather late to hire\nThe how can the gadgets hoping I can break certainly the one way that we can possibly find reliable and get people to be a part of this law family that\n\nYou don't know any painters that are good and the law will we do know painters um that are good I don't really ... yeah that's the part of that there hasn't been reliable\nYou don't know any planners that are good and reliable people well if we do know that and it's they have their own business it as well\nMhm so the only painters that you know that are good and reliable people already have their own business\nFor the most part yeah because they were were trying like we we put 'em on that on Craig's list and like nobody's responding to it and so I just we just don't know where to look in order to get\nWell most of the turnout would rely lay people run around with good reliable people yeah and then most of the time do pushes run around with the ...\nSo usually when I'm looking good reliable people I look around other good reliable people not could be that you look in some of the other trades and you're going to Illinois attrition that's a good person or Trump carpenter that's a good person and you start asking them who did they know that's a great painter that you could bring on to the job\nI'm like you know and there is ample in our world it wouldn't be a painter but in our world that might be someone that's in technology\nSomeone that is a great Rubio unreal developer as an example there's a shortage of technology and Web developer is out there right now\nIn most cities including Nashville in Nashville is actually a tech hub\nBut um you know there's a shortage so where do we find those well we you know we'd go on like you've done websites you've gone on Craig's list but we get in technology groups and associations and but mainly\nGreat developers no other great developers great painters nor the great painters or somebody is not a developer but has other influence in and other knowledge of the tech industry that's a great person will no somebody's right developer and send them our way and of course you're going to pay them\nAnd pay them well and I'm a but paying a ... doesn't make them anything except that will pay ... so\nYou you want to pay people well but you that that's not the part of the only part of the equation as you've already discovered so the only way I don't know how to find them would be to find other people in other trades that are excellent and people in the\nPainting world that are excellent and try to move them onto your team once you get a couple of excellent people they will have a tendency to help you find the other excellent people ah sixty four percent of people that joined our team last year were internal referrals someone already working here\nThat was a thoroughbred wanted new in thoroughbred that wouldn't want them to work here in another area now we have the advantage of being a little bit larger and having a vast array of jobs not just a single job available but but how that's how I've always done it I've I've found thoroughbreds round with thoroughbreds and donkeys run with donkeys\nAnd so you know you just got to find out find your thoroughbreds and and people out in the community the thoroughbred since\nI Do there's a steak dinner in it for you guys send you a good guy you sent him a steak dinner you send him notch soon ... him and his wife through scripts or something because it's worth it to get somebody in there and you know being big good that way\nAnd I'll tell you I'm gonna send you a copy of a book that is one of my favorite hiring books I've read in the last two years and it's from a friend pat Lynch you only it's called the ideal team player\nAnd the ideal team player is three things hungry\nHumble and smart hungry humble and smart\nAnd that's what you're looking for in any position in any organization in every trade and every organization has some people to qualify that are high quality people every single one\nAnd if you can put them together in a trade that by and large is not that kind of people then you really a brand differentiated yourself from the other people in your marketplace\nSo hold on I'll have Kelly pick up and we will send that to you open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five that's triple eight eight to five five two to five\nOr ... is with us in Wilmington, Delaware Hi Lucia how are you Hi there thanks for taking my call sure

said\nOkay so here's the thing you just compare your searching her savings versus the risk of tracking were fairly healthy we don't usually run through the double so the hot adoptable lower premium makes a lot of sense for us and that's how you look at it\n\n\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nLife insurance is not part of the baby steps because it's needed when your family has debt and not enough savings to provide\nFor their financial needs that's when they're at the highest risk and no matter where you are and your baby steps it's a necessity\nMy hero yeah how do you do that or do you tell them what's the key to getting out of debt\nI think it's the budget you got to start there um and I think now on this side of it you just have to believe that it's going to work and just keep plugging away at it um and small steps add up to a giant stuff at the end\nAnd I I Would add to that ah the giving them the tie them um was really cold I mean where when we started I\nUsed to routinely think like while we're driving a church like boys what we're give what we are tied into the church today you know we could do this or do that and I'm just slowly over time that's changed and I don't have this um you know deficit mentality any more aware and taking away it's we've learned how to live\nHave joy within our means\nAnd once you hit that point it's um it just makes the road a lot easier to drive\nYou know so you have a two hundred and fifty thousand dollar mortgage approximately when you started this

and we just just piled on every month and it was\nIt just kept counting it down month by month we're going to make it and it was it was off\nIt but you don't have even going back to work if you didn't already have those numbers calculate knew it was just for a year now they're talking to this ... year were done by them so I'm In for a year yeah and you can embrace a year of paying so by Ben you knew it was really going to happen it was real it was before that that you believe that\nYeah I mean we were under water on her mortgage for about three four years oh language for me it was like when
