from there and so you know you step into right now we are currently saving for big step one\nAnd we have a total that her loan and consumer credit card debt of Seventeen thousand nine hundred dollars [noise]\nMy question is I'm including in that Seventeen I went ahead and rolled in our second mortgage that we purchased on the home we just moved into a ... total two thousand one hundred and thirty five dollars go\nIn my mind um from what I've learned in South you know working on call and we should a role in that second mortgage my reason why I think that is because that's been lower um or build won't pay that off to your\nYour side of mortgage it'll two thousand dollars\nA year or so my wife and I just recently got into her thinking how\nYou know a guy so crude ones they'd be able to two thousand dollar second mortgage yes it's part of your debt snowball and baby step to\nOkay good I was just curious I wasn't sure if that would be the best way to continue to attack this to areas that really true for us with her two daughters\n\n\n\nI give joining us American we're glad you hard here over the bones of Tripoli eight to five five two to five\nBooks is with us from Pensacola, Florida hot Brookes welcome Ramsey show\nBy Dave how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nService for taking my call uh my wife and I were moving up to a San Diego station out there or we have a four house here in Pensacola and um\nI Know you normally say not to buy a house if you're in the military\nUm but as make good money last two times have done it and uh I Am uncomfortable having my whole network and I'm In the stock market basically 'cause we'd be looking at the house about three hundred fifty K. um you know we have three hundred and Fifteen cayenne retirement already in\nBut I Would have to take a two hundred twenty five K. and non retirement investments in order to be able to afford a house up there and also you know I don't want everything and stock market also don't want everything in one house especially if I'm going to live their short time and I wanted to know your body [noise]\n[noise] [noise] um I don't have a problem\nAnd nice [noise]\n[noise] um I don't have a problem with the not wanting everything in the stock market I Would not long distance landlord in order to accomplish my goals though so you're talking about keeping the homeless by foreign Pensacola when you moved to San Diego is that what you're telling me\nNo sir ah we have it on the market I I I only to cash out of this now is on the other guy how well they sell for a a ... about three fifty\nOkay and uh you're not going to be able to buy anything in San Diego for three fifty\nWell not unless I catch up on retirement investments uh you know at two twenty five ... and now I can afford something up\nThere with how much do you have in on retirement is that all you've got a two point five K. non retirement so you're talking about a half million dollar house then yes or what's your household income\nOr about one eighty okay\nThe reason we tell folks to not buy in the military in most cases is because you're not in the home long enough for it to appreciate enough\nTo sell it and make a profit and also sometimes some military markets have an oversupply of homes on the market they're hard to resell\nSo you get stuck in it and you lose money on it in some markets in Pensacola would not be one of those markets usually and certainly San Diego would not be one of those market you're going to see incredible\nAppreciation and incredible market activity in both of those markets you should so so you should be able to get out of this and make a profit on the one you bought there and that's what it sounds like you're doing and you should be able to do the same in San Diego\nAnd I do agree real estate prices are up substantially um\nI'm not sure that you have to use all of that I Would probably if I were in your shoes what would I Do if I woke up in your shoes\nOr I Would either a rent or be I Would pay cash for whatever I bought in San Diego\nAnd that would mean one of two things that neither one of which are going to be comfortable one is I'm not going to I'm not going to spend as much as you're talking about spending instead of been spending five hundred maybe four hundred and leave a hundred and non retirement um or I'm I'm just going to get comfortable\nIn order to have a house like that with having no non retirement investing until I re sell this house now if you re sell this house let's say you bought it for five Seventy five or five fifty use up all your cash a non retirement cash and money from this other home\nAnd it goes up to seven hundred and when your salad you're probably next move moving to a cheaper market\nThere's not any more expensive markets for you to move to in the military than San Diego\nThat's about the ... I mean Hawaii ... Hawaii maybe okay by a there's a couple of other main there's one or two but most of the markets would be well most markets in general not just naval markets but markets in general would be cheaper in the San Diego I think we all agree to that so if you make some money and you're there are three years\nAnd you sell out you're going to put money back in on retirement investing in by a less expensive home may be a larger home but less expensive home the next by in the next station does that make sense\nYes or the so it's not\nReally a permanent decision even if you use all your non retirement cash although I'm with you I don't think I'd want to use it all I'd probably try to buy something\nIn the foreign hundreds instead of in the five hundreds leaving me with some cash and non non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't\nNon non retirement investing a but the point at your point you're making is from my portfolio standpoint I don't like it all in one house and I don't like it all and I don't like so much of it being um I don't like using up all my non retirement investing from a portfolio standpoint\nMy answer to that is is not for that long you're not going to be there ten years\nAnd if you are that that makes us going to change during that ten years\nUh but if you're not then you're going to reset your mix when you buy a different type of real estate agent expense of real estate in the next next location that your station I thank you for serving your country sounds like you're doing a good analysis on it I'm just kind of joining you in the discussion Jason is with us from Tucson, Arizona Hi Jason how are you\nHow you doing better than I deserve what's up\nI I own my own business and I'm a try to figure out how not to be climbing under orange is when I'm ... years old what ... retirement should I go or oh\nOkay well you need to start or retirement and I guess uh\nDo you ... well the first thing we teach folks to do is to get out of that and have an emergency fund before you start retirement and the reason is because if you don't have any payment you have more money freed up to put into retirement and then we want you to put Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement Jason what do you make a year\nA and bounced around a lot of average probably right about a thousand elite [noise]\nOkay so somewhere around fifty grand a year okay the affair and out are you I'm thirty four and okay good do you have any debt\nNo effect good for you are you single OK okay does your wife work outside the home yeah you're a nurse machine make\nA right about that and you\nKnow coming on so you got about a hundred and twenty thousand dollar household income\nAnd no data\nAnd you're thirty four years old well done well we want to have an emergency fund of three to six months of expenses that grandma's rainy day fund and then we would tell you to put Fifteen Percent of your household income\nInto retirement and that's going to be about Eighteen thousand dollars a year in your case going into retirement and now you're asking how to fund that if if she as a nurse has her four oh three or four one K. available at our hospital or a doctor's office you would put some money there especially if there's a match\nAnd then you both need to do\nA Ross IRA you can do five thousand five hundred each that's eleven thousand dollars of the Eighteen that we need to be putting in right there\nAnd put that in good growth stock mutual funds and Jason to help you set that up and teach you how it works just 'cause you need to learn how it works you don't do it because I said do it or someone else said do you do it because you understand it and you don't buy something you don't understand when it comes to investing\nThat I recommend good growth stocks mutual funds for your long term investing in your ... in your Roth IRAs and if you want some

listeners check out one dental dot com it's not dental insurance one dental as a dental discount program\nAt least in some countries [laughter] so yeah\nThat that was the big you know turning point for us when we put that big lump sum of money and our first a student loan payment and there was an awful feeling that hurt but a good feeling\nTo show how much of the six years did you make closer to Seventy five and how much closer to one sixty pretty much the whole six years a product of the last year last year the incomes doubled down ... and so that's a relatively new figure correct them and so really you know basically you paid off for about thirty thousand bucks a year\nFor six years while making about Seventy five right now so you really have been doing this ... okay and then the last year it kicked in and about the time you saw the light of the total income comes up ... yeah I mean what what was the hardest part of this for you all six and a half\nAnd a good um I think for me the hardest part was\nI'm starting it and just seeing the light at the end of the tunnel 'cause when you see that a hundred and Seventy thousand dollars on a piece of paper or to undergraduate degrees and master's degree it's just like is this worth it and um so I think when we paid off our first\nStudent loan um that was just such a victory feeling for us and I'm so it was really hard at the beginning to go from letting our money kind of flow out wherever to really nail down a budget and during the envelope system and that was hard for me to\nThink for me it's just the the sacrifice um you know the world we live in just the spirit of comparison and just seeing everyone around you spend money and buying the nice things and I'm just constantly you know tall yourselves that will be later and you know when we went through the class and I know it's kind of what you always say but it really\nHas been embedded in me is just you know live like no one else so that you can live like no one else and they're not really close to that because there were times where we wanted to give up or they would have been easy to just you know go by what we wanted\nTo be here now to be able to talk to you and all these people and just say that we do that it's just an amazing feeling so\nNear free you know those are those are the ... last three hundred pound it really does as funny as much of a lot of doubt yeah that's pretty incredible ... well I Know it was a long time and a lot of sacrifice was it worth it is or is it was we ever go back into no\nNo no we've never had credit cards we want to cash flow I'm where I'm baby step for well at the beginning steps to babysit for but we're wanting to save up to cash flow for a minivan\nHas ever known to say that but on during the world ... changes your goal is good\nGood for you guys like well congratulations to you have more cheerleaders are more detractors as you went along um\nWe had a lot of cheerleaders yeah we were and really you know supported by her family and our friends especially once we started getting the ball rolling and\nPaying off dead it was kind of just people who are in this belief that we were able to pay off so much and um\nAnd at the same time he went to the big things for us with our journey was um being smart with our money especially all the extra income that was coming in and things like that but we also wanted to still I'm available or in use our money for him and so\nI'm a lot of you know for the first few years\nWe also wanted to still I'm available or in use our money for him and so\nI'm a lot is you know for the

joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money or for you call a AAA eight to five\nFive two to five that's AAA eight to five five two to five Scott's going to start off this hour in New York ... Scott welcome to the Ramsey show\n... thank you for taking my call ... ... you to serve what's up well\nUh recently got married a couple of years ago and we're looking to I'm trying to figure out whether or not to pay\nAnd we all uh I work for the government my wife's a teacher [noise] uh so we're already putting a a ten to Fifteen Percent of our income into our a shirt myself um I actually am a I went to the government version of a financial peace university [noise]\nUm so where are you talking about the ts ate at home I have my job my wife has a ... a three day I'm funny thing is is I'm actually one of the ... coordinator for oh\nFor for that so you're working for five and six you got your return going your debt free you have your emergency phone inflation you have a house that you live in and you have a I guess a rental house as a second house but one of you used to live in is that correct\nCorrect and there's the other house rented\nIt's her her brother is living there um he's living there by himself he's paying us or alternately after the mortgage and the uh association fees and the taxes are paid we're actually losing about a hundred and thirty six dollars a month on the house\nAnd why are you know I said I was in her brother\nWell it's not that we're subsidizing him I'm old\nI'm ... I Would just rather ... at least this was the mindset was that I Would rather have him there and uh we get some tax benefit from the house so I assume that the hundred and thirty six dollars a month that we're losing our we're actually getting back at the end of the year to at least break even or maybe still make some money on on the home\nLike if I was on when they attend gee you talked eight forty AM anti\nMarisa is one of those in Lafayette, Louisiana ... how are you\nTired how are you better than I deserve how can I help\nThat question I Am Seventeen are graduated a year early and I stayed here when my parents made because of a scholarship opportunity I Do not know how does it work myself while going through nursing school because nursing school it's such a tie oriented program\nMhm okay at\nShowing no I'm Sorry ... show you how old I said anything you told me that I'm sure you know and you stayed there because of a scholarship Yes sir to nursing school\nYes sir it's a it's through the state I graduated here and my parents knew because the job opportunities\nOccur so the scholarship is partial Yes sir how much of a scholarship that you're good\nAt twenty thousand ever for years that it wasn't a large one\nTwenty over four years and it's a four year old program I took you Yes sir John and what does it costs it costs ... nearly no kind of which you have five\nKids are so we need eight Yes sir plus you need to eat yeah there's that detail right where are you living with friends family\nWhat I'm living with Frank we split a house out in the country because it's cheaper\nYou and some friends who are room age yes are okay and so you have rent\nAnd electricity or shear and you have food and you need to get out and you need eight thousand dollars\nA year and yet they're okay\nShow when we add all of that up what does your rent and other stuff cost you a month\nIt cost me about nine hundred thousand living on like that and I work\nMinimum wage and I do things like clean and people's houses and things like that trying to make a little bit of extra money\nMhm okay All right so let's let's call it had that up then I get about twelve thousand dollars a year for that and I need a thousand dollars a year for ... for tuition and some other you probably should books and stuff too but we're pretty close their she'll twenty thousand dollars a year is what you need to earn\nIt there and minimum wage doesn't do that isn't there sir sounds like you need a new job\nAnd I have an opportunity to start a whole sailing senator name brand clothing\nAnd and\nNow I don't have the money to put up right now\nNo need to get into that you know my job you need a job you need to show you can make more you can make a Fifteen twenty dollars an hour babysitting and managing\nYou can make\nGood money cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour ten dollars an hour cleaning houses a walking dogs\nMany cleaning houses Fifteen dollars an hour ten dollars an hour cleaning houses I'm walking dogs uh other stuff so I I think we need to get your doing something along those lines and the other benefit of those are not only do you make a lot more than minimum wage\nAnd by the way you make enough to work your way through with the numbers that you and I are discussing here I'm In um you are gonna be working all the time though and if you but if you can get a situation like that the semi self employed where you're cleaning some houses you're doing some nanny and you're doing some whatever\nUm and you uh uh you can control your time and you can make more money you can control when you work and how much you work now you are going to struggle\nBecause you're going to work and study and go to class and that's all you're going to but you can make it if you do that\nThe other thing I Would do is I Would apply for a bunch of scholarships the third thing I Would do is investigate some of the hospital companies that are out there particularly in your immediate area talk to the nursing school\nAnd see if there are any of them that if you agree to work for them for a couple of years after school how much of the nursing they would pick up for you\nOkay kind of an indentured servants type program if you've ever heard of those\nFacts and I married a hospital that actually planning on working at ... ... they will forget all life like it I like that in fact body\nWell let's see if we can get a job over there now and let them just pay for it now\nOkay rather than have to pay you back for student loans because I'm trying to keep you out of student loans with the math were you in are doing here\nSo I I Want you to apply for a hundred more scholarships you'll get turned down for most of them but if you get another five thousand it really helps the situation a lot I Want you to think about doing different things for work that make you a lot more money and you couldn't control the time\nAnd I want you to investigate with this hospital or what they will do and talk to the nursing school about ... anything they can do to help you as well that you're working your way through but\nYou you sound like you are to me just talking to you you're you're very very mature for Seventeen years old that sounds to me like you're a rock star thinking and so I don't think you need to play beer pong his real\nHot [laughter]\nThink you don't mind working in and grinding and hustling grind to get your way through this and not come out of this with you know forty fifty ten thousand twenty thousand dollars of student loan that you don't need to it\nBut you're going to have to make some very distinct and very careful choices to do this and the good news is you're living expenses are very reasonable and your tuition is very reasonable and the third piece of good news is you've chosen a fabulous career\nIn terms of employment you will be able to get employed instantaneously\nI'm mean nursing is just there's always a shortage so you're going to do very very well but I Would go talk to that they'll talk to the hospital administrator at the local hospital to set up an appointment with them and just walk in there like you own the place\nIs a kind of think you can do that and uh just tell them that they need to pay for your school and then you'll promise to work there how's that work\nAnd how can you help me get through school because I don't want a bunch of student loan debt I'm trying to not be a statistic and you know get get him impressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that a hospital administrator\nImpressed with you and and let him help you be a hero in your story and a him or her that hospital administrator\nWho by the white needs nurses so they're going to be very intentioned\nA very very inclined towards helping someone in your position especially someone who walks in and ask for help and walks in and says what can I Do to earn some help and so on and um you know get get some people on your side helping you accomplish this um\nThis task splits in front of you but you're on your way you're doing really good congratulations very proud to talk to you call me back if you need help is you're fighting through this Greg is with us from Milwaukee Hi Greg how are you\nDave thank you for taking my call how are you today\nBetter than I deserve what's up\n[noise] well I just have a question for you I'm On a way out our portfolio and get your opinion on a couple of things here um my wife and I don't have any debt out with the exception all of our house\nUm we do a lease our cars and um [noise] we do that um I have a customer and that and a good kind of mine that I reciprocate or the money that they spend with me back with them so it's kind of a win win situation\nUm for both of us here the main question that I have is we have\nUm [noise] some investments 'em over a hundred thousand dollars with\n'em too off IRAs and some mutual funds and that type of thing uh she has four one K. I. of four one K. actually has a pension Amish awhile and right now we are paying above and beyond our mortgage I'm at our house by about\nTen to twenty percent and and putting that toward the house with the amount of investments that we have diversified compared to what we're putting into our houses is that the right formula\nWe tell folks but Fifteen Percent of your income into retirement once you're dead free except the house and have your emergency fund and above Fifteen Percent of your income and going into retirement and your debt free except your emergency fund then I Will put everything above that towards the house till the house to bite off\nSo take your income sounds point one five\nMake sure the total of all the Roth IRAs four one\nK. close to reaching you're doing is essentially that enough right isn't that much greater than that back some of those contributions down a little bit and throw the balance of our service not up to that as you get it up to that that's where the balance of the house and um\nThen we suggested it was a mutual funds of categories gross roasted income aggressive growth and international [noise]\nI get asked all the time when in the baby steps is the right time to buy life insurance my answer is typically now\nYou know what I'm saying is that does that ring a bell with you yeah okay yeah you're back\nYeah they all use back and you got a future and it's right and it's going to be good and ah yeah moving in the condo but it's on my way to a house of them won't pay cash for 'cause my income is going to go up and goes back\nAnd uh yeah I'm ... I'm not going camping anymore fifty five\nIt was okay to do that for a little while no shame in that game but that but you you you know you got past that stage now your back is that okay yeah cool thanks for dropping by things open phones at triple eight eight to five five two to five Claire is with us in Atlanta Georgia Hi Claire how are you\nI'm good how are you know good how can I help\n[noise] um I have a question for you so we've been calling your data sets for a little less than a year now and I feel like we are on that it had on retirement that we're behind on college savings for two kids show\nHow old are your kids you and they are twelve and ten okay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement\nThey are twelve and ten okay and how old are you guys we are forty six okay and how much is in retirement I'm a little over a million little your head congratulations ... so what's your household income\nDefinitely feel that way I like yeah we\nWe are I mean when you have more than a million dollars you're a millionaire yeah okay yeah yeah right [laughter] yeah so ... what is your household income\nA little over two hundred okay\nSo why can you not say Fifteen Percent of two hundred and still catch up and get have plenty of money for college when you've got eight years before college\nWell let's hang or private school right now as well what are you paying for private school how much cash how much ... than a year per kid or total total okay you make two fifty went looking at you like it\nYou don't have to make two hundred I leave me one eighty\nOkay\nAnd if you can cash flow twenty thousand a year for private school that's ... ... that cash flow can be turned towards cash flow in college too if they choose a college that's a reasonably expensive\nYeah OK okay that's a good point and yeah All right\nSo I I you know Fifteen Percent of your household income going into retirement you don't need it you're in good shape I agree with you if you want to stop it's not the end of the moral\nBut I don't think you have to stop if you'll just sit down and actually do a written budget on a two hundred thousand dollar your income twenty thousand out for kids' school today we're going to offset some of that was cash flow in some college but some college we want to set aside\nAnd put Fifteen Percent ahead side so we're only talking about thirty thousand dollars that's fifty thousand bucks going into these two things\nCollege in return I mean I'm Sorry a private school in retirement and then we got to say something to college you saved ten grand a year\nPer kid another twenty grand you can do that\nA front for from now until they go to school they'll have plenty of money\nI mean you just Jack up to five twenty nine and pick out good mutual funds that you control inside that five twenty nine get with one of those smart vest or prose and they'll help you do that ... day Ramsey dot com for a list of them in your area the people we recommend them sit down when you were there five twenty nine together\nAnd pop ten grand a piece in those two I don't think you have to cut retirement back but if you're putting more than Fifteen Percent into retirement than you're not working our plan at this stage\n\nDoes you put Fifteen Percent into retirement until college and it was done and houses paid off only when those two things are done and then you're a baby steps seven to increase returned might be on Fifteen Percent and Fifteen Percent or two hundred thousand thirty ground\nSo that that's what I'm doing the math here I think you can do it I think you just gotta sit down and not have this vague worry about it\nAnd instead of having an actual game plan will lay out and go this is important this is more important than other things that we're doing that we need to stop doing so that we can do this\nAnd that's ten grand a year per kid for college to kids that's twenty grand if that's where I mean you've got is where you are so good questions thanks for joining U.S Open phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Donald's on Twitter at Dave Ramsey\nAt Dave Ramsey I

much at all okay as far as what it says income [noise] ah it's around Ninety thousand\nOkay in most states your attorney would have to advise you but in most states you would be do some alimony after twenty two years\nAnd that will going with your fifty thousand is how you will reset your life and stay out of debt and start working your way through these student loans that are outrageous and are going to take some time to work through\n'em but you're going to be working extra job you're going to be doing everything else taking any any money you can squeeze out of your budget and you are not going to Mexico you gotta mess on your hands\n[laughter] okay no I'm not\nSo um unless it's to escape no just kidding [laughter] ah but the ... so you know you're going to be on beans and rice rice and beans you're gonna get the cheapest department you can get you gonna stay dead free and address these student loans as soon as you can get stabilize ...\nAfter the separation which will lead to a divorce unless it leads to you all getting back together\nOkay but you pro care for separation the same way financially you would prepare for a divorce and that put you in a position of strength\nTo negotiate in the divorce financially\nUm and that's something that you'll have to do and your attorney and you get representation and you'd be ready to pay them pile up money for deposits and we're paying them don't pay extra on the student loans until you get the other side of this and I'll just put 'em on ... and pay nothing right now\nBut let's get the other side has but but my hope is is that you guys you can see a counselor who can give you some words to say some tools to give Bob I'll wake up call maybe the two you sit down with a coach a counselor and walk you through turning the corner on all of this before you get so far around the corner we can't get you back\nAnd may be you can save this thing I I that would be best for everybody involved I'm\nAssuming the issues that you have that are causing you such concern or addressed and I'm sure that I'm sounded like a pretty long list but I'm just an address some ... see a counselor for your sake call your pastor say who can I sit down with can walk me through\n'em\nIn the right questions to ask myself the right questions to ask him um 'cause he may think you're kidding oh he may think you're bluffing and when you actually move out it may it may wake him up and he may be willing to work on that list at that point I don't know\nBut those kinds of things are best guided by a really good marriage counselor that's really experienced and wise and\nA godly council a will help you in that situation I sure hope you guys can turn that around that would be my hope for you\nIt'd be better for all of you are financially as well as everything else so good question thank you for joining U.S Open phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find you jump and we'll talk about your life and your money interesting\nJoining U.S Open phones a AAA eight to five five two to five you jump and we'll talk about your life and your money interesting data that just came out on the article I read on the air about marriage\nAnd um [noise] the men who are married and make more\nOn average about Fifteen Percent for the men who aren't married women make twenty five to thirty or something more that are married than are married I don't know why that is exactly but it's an interesting discussion of this is the day Ramsey [noise]\n\n\nListen up leaders if you want to be a better leader if you want us to arrive at not just survive in today's market I got some great news on November night where to live streaming are on trade leadership one day\nCats I told them so I'm a lot more concerned about his lack of grass that this was the family goal than I Am whether or not you keep those ring ... personally I take it back I mean I've been married thirty five years old and they're just you know it'd\nBe nice to have an ice rink and you can get another ring I mean there's a stupid rings everywhere I mean there's not a big thing it's not like at your wedding ring or something and it was a an anniversary gift that you all couldn't afford\nOne way and he I mean sweet but dumb who you know right yeah I think so but I think\nThe thing is here yeah I'm probably taking it back but more importantly I Want to take his brain and screw it back and a little bit better you know in the two year old is are we really doing this or not because otherwise you're you're never going to get there\nBecause apparently he's not on the same page or on that's big thing I mean Ninety percent of this question is around that ten percent on one of the keep the ring or not so young and so this ring is not going to make or break you get out of debt plan one way or the other but this behavior will\nAnd this lack of being on the same page will so\nYou know what let's just talk this through in and make sure we're on the same page and then you guys decide together what to do with the ring and I don't know I I it just represents dumb and so I'm not ever going to really be able to enjoy is\nIf I'm you know because it's just in violation of where you thought your whole family was heading and it's like just kind of you know it's you know you guys are just too old to do that kind of stuff so I mean that's twenty year old stuff rather\nOpen phones a AAA eight to five five two to five Shay is with us in Fort Worth ... how are you\nI'm good how are you there better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um so I recently discovered you like as recently as about three years ago um started doing your thing and play a we ended up going out to get out of debt I'm from New York teaching a my father\nDied about five years ago on a motorcycle act and and um there were a bunch of life insurance policies that went through our personal financial adviser has been advising my mother ever and then\nUm and the question that I have is\nHe put her in in in ... about um\nFive years ago whenever my dad died a three hundred thousand dollars and the annuity um and then the other investment Peter and back then and they've been growing a little bit here and there\nUm but the question is the annuity recently we've got the five year mark and ah he's advising to pull the money I started that fan which I think is a good idea however the question is is that\nShe should have should she had that the money impacted initially at the beginning of the uh time you know instead of putting putting in ... she brings home about thirty five hundred dollars a month and retirement and Social Security but he doesn't need the the drawn anybody at all you know and he knew that at the beginning of the time\nYou know well yeah you're right that makes me question and other things that are going on that I don't know what they are from you\nI'm but I I I I and I am\nI personally would have put all of it and the good investments at the time um you know it is the home paid off\nAlmost paid off one hundred percent cars are paid off she has the wrote that\nHe wrote good good okay and how much is investments total this three hundred plus I'm\nYeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty thousand\nOkay and how much is in investments total there's three hundred plus\nI'm yeah we're looking at probably about four hundred and twenty four hundred and fifty dollar an hour with all the investment of you to out another fifty to sixty yeah how are they really honored their\nOld is she\nUh she ... she just turned sixty okay All right cool and then she didn't write out she's not like an old ... year old on her way out right out\nGood I'm feeling better fifty seven there you say that so um [laughter] ah I'm not on my way out today either a anyway or at least to do them out to my knowledge anyway so yeah I I'm probably going to question all of that I mean it's um it's not it's not like you\nPut her in Hawaii policy which will be like a deal breaker or something silly like that I mean that just the annuity is is you know got a lot more fees to it a lot more commission to it and if it was a variable annuity in the money was in good mutual funds are probably performed okay\nUh they're okay um but it's not my favorite thing to do but it's not to the point that are like question his entire competency I just really want to know\nIf it wasn't right for her ... if it's not right for her now why wasn't right for her then that's a good question in your mind Mr advisor\nAnd um I think you got the right to ask that question and talk it through with them and if you can't get a comfort level or if he goes up on you and starts having an attitude and that's when you know it's time to move any to anyway so you do that with any financial people are people that are advising you on technical matters when they start\nGetting like ... like you have to owe them an explanation instead of vice versa it's time to move on\nInsurance lady gets an attitude it's time to move on right in your state plan or\nIs too smart to sit down and explain something to you then it's time to move on so you know you just you gotta get folk in your corner that have the heart of a teacher so if he if he can walk you through what his thinking was or you can get comfortable with it than you stay with him
