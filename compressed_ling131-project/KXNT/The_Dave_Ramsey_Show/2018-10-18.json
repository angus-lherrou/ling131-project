Ramsey your host this is your show America 'cause it's all about you [noise] it's a free gall and some say the advisors worth what you pay for the phone numbers\nAAA eight to five five to Tucson that's AAA eight to five five two to five Isaiah is with us from Columbus ohio Hi Isaiah how are you\n[laughter] Hi Dave how are you better\nThan I deserve what's up\n[noise] same here you're kind of on a constant loop and our home my daughter called the uncle Dave\n[laughter] um so I wanted to know um [noise] we watched that a lot and uh one of the shows or someone said something about a pack of and uh I at the time he laughed until it was pretty funny apparently but I just wanted to know since my wife and I are worth saving up and working to uh\nStart our own ranch and a raise alpacas I Want to know if you knew something that I didn't and maybe\nUh I should change course or something\nI don't even remember what you're talking about but um I guess I can comment on our practice I was trying I think we were talking about ...\nI Believe that he was younger though went broke several years ago 'cause there was this emu fad\nAnd a bunch of people bought him use and then there was just supposed to be there's a huge demand for the meat and it was basically a bunch of crap there was no demand for him your meat and I'm pretty soon people just said daddy muse everywhere but\nI'm a you know alpacas I mean I I Know I'm not an expert on alpacas I'm not even an expert on branches um but from a business perspective I think you're entering a pretty narrow market\nAgree yes\nAnd you better really no your stuff and you better really do this you can't do it just goes you read\nSome article about how ... can be rich\nGoes or not I mean any more than any more than cows are making people rich cows make people pretty poor all the time and some of them they make people rich but it sounded as do other running a business um called cattle you know and in a business and when it ceases to be a business and starts to be a sad\nUm or never becomes a business goes all of this was a fad than there you go so what is the deal what are you what do you get out of ... what's the product\nThe product the fleece or you can use me [noise] um you can turn into sweaters and socks and so forth I'm very similar to Kashmir and the ... the police you know um [noise] and ah there you can also breed and a\n\n\nScott is with us from Denver welcome Ramsey show Scott\nIs said to myself sure [noise]\nUm well I work at a truck\nDriver I'm never home so I'm trying to find out later in life like retirement and I'm Wondering what would be a good idea on how to invest that extra money I have to put my out the middle east now you know that's a\nGood question how old are you a fifty or fifty four near single\nOkay and how many years do you think before you buy a house\n[noise] um I'm thinking oh he's sixteen\nOkay All right cool well as long as you've got more than five years I Would use a simple growth stock mutual fund\nOr a series of them for something like that I probably would just using the F and P index fund\nBecause it will grow virtually without paying taxes on it until you pull it out as a what's called a low turnover ratio which means the taxes aren't charge much on the growth until you cash it in and so I started to uh go to ... five hundred fund an index fund\nAnd use that to grow for the next five ten years or so until you buy a house as long as you leave it alone as long as you plan to leave it alone at least five years you can survive the gyrations of the stock market and you should be fine\nIn that and that that's exactly what I Would do I do a similar thing Scott in sometimes I've got some extra money and I'm just saving up for my next real estate purchase as an investment\nAnd um even if I don't know five years in that case I'll ride the market with it and I 'cause I can afford for it to go down if I mess up a little bit but yeah that that's the direction I Would go good question Robby is with us in Pittsburgh hey Robbie welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHey Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\nThank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick\nYeah hey Dave how are you better than I deserve once up\nA thank you so much for taking my call yeah I had a quick question [noise] ah so I Am a nurse or by profession and my wife is a nurse and that that as a I Am wondering if I should go back to school again next year\nOr so my question is if they work for me to go to school now I'm thirty two years old and my wife is\nUh twenty nine we make a combined income right now off a two hundred and a two hundred and twenty thousand a year and um so if I go to school it's going to cost me three years of not working\nOn that tuition of around Ninety thousand dollars mhm uh but uh our gross income after I go to school and be successful uh together would be close to a three hundred thousand\nMhm so\nUh but it's a year now ah right now around Seventy thousand\n... you're saying this is going to cost you a three hundred room three years and get them for three years of Seventy thousand missing plus nine out of pocket yeah okay can you cash flow than any out of pocket and can you live on her income or you're doing this\nI can live on her income for sure that's how we did it when she was in school [noise] um but I don't think I can catch anything right now because I and I also don't have a house or at the moment so I was you know planning on buying a house or or putting at least they're putting a down payment for a house\nNext year before I start school so then you need to wait until you can pay for school or whatever but you\nNever in Thirty years of doing the show recommended somebody borrow money to go to school\nOkay\nYou got the cash flow to do it it's just a matter when you do it and what you put for what you put second you might plenty of money to come up with ...\nYeah plenty of money and you don't have to have the whole money up front you just got to see in your budget how you can cash flow would um I can see it pretty easily ... owns it take to go through the class again or go to ... ... it's a three year program so thirty grand a year\nA thirty grand a year yeah and and she makes what\nA she makes a hundred and fifty thousand\nYou can't catch ... already granted I'm a hundred and fifty\nA law not when I'm not in school\nNow if you're in school she makes a hundred and fifty thousand dollars in ... thirty thousand over a hundred and fifty to go to school year for three years\nI I'm I'm Sorry fifty thousand it's ... it's a it's going to be around a sixty thousand a year\nI thought you said it was Ninety thousand of sorry I got that wrong it's it's a sixty thousand a year seems high yeah it is that is or if it is an expensive program you know go to a less expensive program\nSo that but cash flow it whenever you're going to pay for it figure out a way to\nPay for it if I usually go you don't actually have an old style stacked up ahead of time but you've got to see where it's going to come from I Would not recommend you go get student loans because here's the thing everyone starts that program doesn't finish it but every one that takes out student loans just aren't that program has on student loans whether they're finished or not\nAnd then you've got what's known as a freaking mess\nAnd so I'm not suggesting you're dumber you can't pass the test or something like that my life happens to in the last thing you want the only time debt works as of everything works\nOther than that that doesn't work\nAnd so we tell you to stay away from it thanks for the call\nOpen phones a triple eight eight to five five two to five Joshua is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you better\nEight to five five two to five Joshua ... is in Dallas texas Hi Joshua how are you\nI'm good how are you better than I deserve what's up\nSo basically I Am stuck in between whether I should file for bankruptcy or just go ahead and start paying 'em all my debt off what y'all ball basically all my debts except my car are in collection\nSo that's why that's the only reason I'm basically contemplating\nUm bankruptcy why are they only go actions um they're like oh medical bill um one is that is a car they got a ... ... ... I lost my job mhm and uh I think I think like a phone bill and then there too mhm\nOkay so how much is the ...\n[noise] um [noise] that one's actually only like a couple of ... um ... it's what I have on there is a Ninety\nFive thousand four hundred and forty five dollars from an old apartment mhm how long ago was a three and a half years ago\nIn time and how ... how much how much money on your medical data began\nI Would say about two thousand and one of the doubt if you go to\nThe rest of it is it just makes the narrow like my ... a ... I think a phone bill and oh it's a payday Lowe is well you know\nSo your your total that's less than twenty thousand dollars\nRight and then I have um my car which is a twelfth out mhm okay and what do you make a year I'm\nA little bit old for forty five I make a thousand a week I'm a independent contractor\nMhm and you're single or married you're married owner and\nI'm twenty eight on Saturday that happy birthday does she work outside the home\nUm you know she stays at home and take care of her daughter\nOkay yeah mhm well\nLet me tell you what I'm hearing okay and I think I'm hearing maybe I'm wrong I'm a ... cat used to say that debt is not the problem is is a symptom\nOf something else that's going on I'm right and it sounds like you guys have never told your money what to do you've never had any savings for emergencies so every time an emergency comes up you get thrown out of an apartment suit your car gets ... and you end up with a mess\nYes they're so we've got to get you on a plan where you are telling your money what to do or you're going to be back here if I waved him on and made all this debt go away which is what bankruptcy might do maybe I'm if it did that make you have a zero down all of a sudden except your car\nIf you don't change the habits that causes this mess in the first place you'll be back right where you are someday do you agree\nYes there you know so we really need to get on there that says bankruptcy doesn't solve that are you going to solve that in the mirror you and your wife learning how to handle money I don't think you're bankrupt I think you're scared disorganized don't know what to do and have done nothing so far\nI think you can probably settle that old apartment death for three or four grand if you saved it up and offer them a lump sum settlement uh I\nI've actually called them by multiple times when I started listening to you that was one of the first videos that I was looking up is how to get that collect bears you know a ...\nDon't it doesn't change my answer to whether it's nine thousand and three thousand new film I think it's still about you getting control your money and when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not a problem but have you\nAnd you get in control of your money and when you do that then you're going to see your way through this bankruptcy is not a bad problem that you have your problem was gone and I'll help you out I'm a singer stopping the total money make over ... read that take an extra job sell everything in sight and let's get as much cleaned up I'll

because I Love her because you love her and you don't want to see her in pain and she refuses to do the things she calls the pain to go away\nMhm okay\nAnd you're more concerned about her behavior

more organized when it comes to our financial um so I guess that on the phone and resold and um ... because it was a private loan chase 'em so\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] somebody up at the bottom of the ...\n[noise] coming up at the bottom of the hour Ramsey personalities rented personality Anthony O'Neill's will join us I don't think he's got to probably one personality and he's going to join us at the bottom of the hour\nAnd he is a teenage experts many speaks with teens all over America just did a wonderful talking smart conference on what your teenagers want you to know whether there's something to think about\nNow he's the author of the graduate survival God's five mistakes you cannot afford to making college if you are a teen or you're a college student or Europe parent of one of the above and you've got questions\nAbout anything Anthony will be here the phone numbers triple eight\nEight to five five two to five were opening up a couple of lines for that right now Heather\nIs in the lobby of Ramsey solutions from Spokane, Washington where the question\nI Heather Hi Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up and I just finished baby step three and now I'm working on baby steps three ... saving for a house got your emergency fund good for ... yeah and I wanted to know how long is too long in baby step three being the flashy lives on today the step for\nWas not a magic answer the concept or the other critical thinking skills for the answer is simply this\nIf you stay there so long that you don't save for retirement you screwed up your retirement right or if you don't stay there long enough then you don't have a good solid down payment and you'll end up with other problems on the mortgage so it's the it's the pull between those two things\nAnd most people that means you know three years four years something like that um but if you're if you're fifty nine that might not be that long or you're not fifty nine now how old are you\nAnd twenty eight on friday\nOkay cool and so I mean if you stayed out for four years and never started any retirement until thirty two but you had a really juicy down payment on a house and got a ... at you know how to plan to pay it off in a few years because of that you're not you're you're still going to retire multi millionaire you know if you do that at it but if you stayed out for Twenty years\nIn called that baby steps freebie see what I'm that's yeah that's kind of how you think through it from a critical thinking skills standpoint so how long were you thinking of\nLike just started in June and I'm hoping to have it done in two years\nOkay and so Thirty years old you're your game own on retirement taken out a Fifteen year mortgage by forty five the mortgage is paid for if not sooner and uh you will of saved thirty five years at Fifteen Percent of your income which unless you just don't work\nIs going to make you a millionaire multimillionaire usually I'm doing this so you're in a safe zone there but that's how you make the decision more importantly than they Ramsey says never go more than three years that's not how it works it's just you're pulling those two things are pulling at each other or because you're not saving for retirement the longer you go yeah that's all it is I thanks for stopping by think states\nOpen phones at triple eight eight to five five to to find Julian is in New York City Hi Julian how are you know\nI ... it can you hear me okay I can how can I help\nThank you very much for taking my call so I'm In a a bit of a unique position I'm I'm twenty four next year I'm going to medical school and uh I was I'm very very lucky and very appreciative uh I'm not going to have any debt to after graduating medical school but at the gate the rather than the included\nI I decided to specialize um and uh would you get a fellow or what\nUm uh yeah I'm not certain is that what I Want to do yet I no no no I'm I'm asking how you did that\nOh oh um yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um wow I'm very very bad\nAnd how you did that\nOh um yeah so so if they get from my father and my grandparents um wow I'm very very very appreciative yeah\nGood now yeah you should be that's amazing wonderful so how can I tell\n'em yes away when I was Twenty one uh I was given a essentially control is funny 'cause it's under my name I'm but I'm Sorry I Apologize I'm so I'm\nA yeah I was I was given controls this money and uh I've been given a very good financial advice from my father who's helping me manage it but\nUm because it's under my name and he he's essentially hacking the rain stopped me or I Would like a a second opinion as to what to do with this money I can give it a little bit of\nMoney for a living expenses um and I said that about five thousand dollars from some small side jobs at hospitals but I Want to know how to capitalize on this and a half that myself up as best as I can for after medical school\nWell the the thing I Would be most concerned about is that the money is available and enough to get you through medical school\nUm it it definitely is um about one third of it is invested very securely and two thirds of it I have in savings or at least two thirds we were discussing putting into at AT T bill on three months when duo basis until I needed to take them out that the pay my tuition and then I Would just reinvent the rest\nUm well I probably would not do that and the only reason is is that the bills basically or bonds and a bond interest rates were yields a go the bond values\nRather go down as interest rates go up and we are in an increasing in the interest rate environment so if you put a hundred thousand dollars in the bills or could turn into Ninety pretty quick\nAs interest rates increase so that's not a very safe investment in the environment that we're in right now um but if you wanted to have some portion of the money invested I probably would go to something like gross income type funds I'm but I'm okay if there's enough there to do simple division and it doesn't have to really earn anything\nIf you want to keep it all very very safe that would be okay with me because the most important thing is for you to be able to graduate with zero debt\nAnd if you screw around with his money in some way and it loses value and you're not able to do that then the whole you know is like a ... we were concentrating on the wrong thing\nAnd a Julian is the right thing to concentrate on Julian ... debt free graduation is the most important part of this math equation not what this money is paying\nA it'd be nice to be a little bit sophisticated about it but if you get caught up in some kind of a sophisticated process and you end up losing money trying to trying to just get a little bit more on this lump sum a you've defeated your own purpose Detroit yourself in the foot so to speak so um\nThat's the process you're looking at I'm going to keep it pretty safe or if you want to go toward something that's fine but I wouldn't use bonds for anything right now a possible play Kimberly is in Pensacola Hi Kimberley how are you\nEven though I'm great thank you so much for taking my call sure I I just want to thank you for all you do this thing can very Well Mark I think seven years and it's not and I had paid off very bad and following their plans to go for that\nAnd of course they it's I'm not an hour at all concerned about our parents' killer and how can you give it some advice on how they got them um\nUm my sister now are a little concerned about our parents are hoping you could give us some advice on how they could got them um my parents live in North Carolina and they live in a flooded area of flood prone area\nAnd I'm so every time there hurricane come through um they they experienced some flooding it on their on their property at their home as well as my dad is\nAnd we were just wander and what you can end as far as the shit they sell it and then um they have now that they do have um the savings and my mom has a ticket for one\nTo fall off and does his property blood\nWell and not enough on a um it flooded and it was it got like forty inches in the house and I think about ten feet in his shop\nAnd then two years ago um it got and my dad shop I think about three feet or so and it almost at like about six inches from getting in that house again\nAnd I'm so ... there's only been two major flood but um but they're in their sixties and it it's very emotional for them at any town a farm and it's just\nIt's throughout this past down we actually packed the or I didn't and my sister was able to help them I was out of state but they packed up all their belongings and let them put them away and you know because they were afraid that\nThey're so what else are is living there has become more painful than not living there\nBut those are the fear of rising water even even the fear is not founded we once on Twenty years is not that bad but bottom line is is that it's developed a phobia for them\nAnd they're not have been living there sort of a fun living there why wouldn't they move right I don't I mean the actual threat a\nFlood statistically with what you've given me I wouldn't be concerned about but if they're absolutely panicking Everytime the weather person comes also draining and it's just not going to live there so you know it was more of an emotional decision the role that Islam liver move\n[noise]\n\nYou've heard me talk about id there for years and now it's only a matter of time before you become a victim but I run across some numbers that even surprised me and shows the real nightmare that people go through when they become a victim of the sixteen million victims of identity of last year yes sixteen million\nA life skills book to someone just because we're successful in one area or in sort of you got a twenty six year old music star yeah um well they're good at music but what happens is we see them being very successful there\nEven me I'm fifty eight I Know better I've worked with NFL players for Twenty years off and on\nAnd um I Know this is a a a world class\nOne half of one percent athlete um but they are twenty two guests there and the rest of their life skills are not developed at the level that they're football skills are developed they are the size of a key uh yeah [laughter] but that doesn't mean that their life skills have developed [laughter] at the same level and you know so\nIt it's it's kinda weird I told somebody during one of these rookie camps as like you're looking at this guy the size of a key but when you look in his eyes you see a Thirteen year old yes um because he still is football skills are are the best one of the planet here\nI'm In his physical acumen his physical uh IQ the things you can do this body and MIT error or it's just circus like it's amazing what those guys can do\nIt but what happens is when you watch that skill level especially if you're just watching on TV\nYou think of that guy as you know a forty year old who's a mature developed a ... as you know strong marriage has all these other things and these guys are college kids are out they were in college last week yeah you know there's twenty minutes ago and I'm\nEven a player that's been in the league three years yeah they're still young and they're still I'm twenty five years old ... and so it's uh it's interesting in the same thing happens with music people when they get a success level earlier a thing where you're spotlight and you get a success level\nAnd your skill is world class in that thing does not mean you have everything else together yeah yeah and that's true with a you know teenagers in general is one of the things we do this entrepreneur tool box\nIs they can start to develop some of those skills you know running a business\nYeah they and that's absolutely right you know you say this all the time when in America nosy nosy for saying this but the NFL stands for not for a long and are these football players young football players know that like hey I Need\nI went in America nosy nosy for saying this but the NFL stands for not for a long and are these football players young football players know that like hey I Need to develop something now\nBecause in probably in three years I Would not be in this league mhm um and the most money these kids were make will be within their first three to five years of the league if they make it past and\nAnd so I I I told them like ... you have to get focused but when we look at these twenty two year oh this is why I'm so passionate about that Fifteen you wrote about that Thirteen you wrote getting you know the peanuts one or two about kids get into graduate survival guide a book and also taking our financial foundations curriculum is out of a classroom\nBecause all of that teaches what the old they're professionals do not know ... if they can get it at Thirteen like these middle school kids day four out here now taking our middle school curriculum\nYou know they are um a head of the game like they were teaching me some stuff earlier today I'm like wow like winning the world and so just to see these young kids are getting it\nTaken our curriculum learning learning how to budget learning how what is the difference between a credit card in a debit card and these kids like me and I'm not financing anything like that just gets me excited\nYeah ... is dolled in ... in a life skill yes life skills stuff and you need life skills whether you're Seventeen or fifty seven yeah you know and this this money thing\nYou know the basic stuff of being out of debt being on a budget of having your emergency fund the stuff we talk about her every day on the air it it really does work for teenagers and the interesting thing is they're not um\nYou know that they're not like rusted into place right you know they're they're pretty they're pretty\nUh uh elastic in their spirits in that they can receive this stuff sometimes more than some of us are a little older and we get a little stiffer on our spirit and we don't where she was quite as well they're like okay let's go let's do that right\nRight and they're not like old docked in and go now to argue with you about ... ... ... ... it's a it's easier to get through most of the time you know a big argument or did it have to have a credit card you have to have strong loan you don't\nHave to have a car payment they don't hear all that from the fourteen year old when you're able to sit and talk to them they're just ready to go what is it we need to do to win\nYesterday and Dave you and I was talking about this as smart conference me when Hogan I was reading an article they're saying that this younger generation teams of millennials are not entrepreneur\nAnd I'm like man that's that's a bunch of bologna the ... he wrote that stupid [laughter] and so I get excited because I'm seeing this younger generation they are making stupid mistakes because no one never taught them once they learn\nThey tend to not make that same mistake in an area of the finances but they have to be taught at first\nSo that's what I Love about what we're doing is we're giving them life skills to business skills through the teen entrepreneur tool box kid we're helping them understand how to deal with their finances and how to make the right decisions earlier on with our middle school curriculum with the graduate survival guide\nAnd when I see these young people come up to me saying man I cannot do and it thank you so much for teaching me earlier on because we make learning about money Dave and our organization where young people coolest heck that are on you know and so it's fine\nAnthony O'Neill

D\n[noise]\n\nOffices in Jacksonville, Florida Hi Travis welcome to that I rent them hey Dave how're you doing today taking my call sure you've heard a settle the debate for my wife and all that ... or\n... future um we have about Seventy five thousand dollar the debt collectors we um we own our home outright uh we have a vehicle that is being chased Seventy five thousand probably make a decent money and we have an Iran\nThat has about two hundred and fifty and it sort of the court and on and what is what's decent money\nOr she makes about one twenty and I make about eighty okay\nSo the real question that are that are ... that we have is um her mother and father passed away last year and uh she was in an American that an ... and she has a certain amount of distribution every year for tax for my idea or the inheritance money I'm is who\nOne lump sum\nPay off all of our debt and then ... hey ourselves back off of that to an IRA I'm so that we don't have to worry about including repaying the interest game if you will or a worry about that is that she um you know she is going to be\nShould we go ahead and take the distribution hail all of our dads about why wander paying the um you know the interest rate or should we go at it I hated that down and we are are they going to be there for you when you when you're well\nWe've been using for almost Thirty years a decision making paradigm a decision making structure that is based on the idea of what is the fastest way to wealth what is the shortest distance the wealth\nAnd I'm In the process what in other words what gives us the greatest returns and what give what gives us the least risk what what has a level of wisdom to it um and is not just one sided it's not all investing mind that it's not all\nThat in mind that it's not anything it's just a process of financial planning process that process has now been proven obviously doing it for twenty five years in many many people have become millionaires and multi millionaires gradually not get rich quick using that process\nUm then the question becomes do you guys were you agree to use that process and if you're so that the way I Would answer the question obviously may being me is I'm gonna tell you use that process and that won't answer your question what to do with the money\nBut um but you've got a first aside do you want to do that or not I mean that's that's that's the core disagreement here what the process is based on the process is called the baby steps\nAnd what it's based on is a couple of things number one you're most powerful wealth building tool\nIs your income\nAnd freeing up your income and not having that not only lowers risk not only increases the peace and the quality of the relationship in the household but it also increases mathematically\nFreeze up all of your income just to make money with instead of giving it to banks and uh and the second part of the things are driving the process is is that personal finance is eighty percent behavior it's only twenty percent had knowledge stuff we're talking about it's not really rocket science here\nThere's not a lot to the math it's it's about fourth or fifth grade math is really all it is so having said that we say baby step one side of a thousand dollars you guys are obviously done that too is to be debt free everything but your house you've not done that\nThree is to have an emergency fond of three to six months of expenses I didn't hear that you've done that and then force you don't have that for a start putting Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement so how much is in your emergency fund\nCurrently we have about twenty five or so in our settings now\nIf the inheritance was not on the table or we would teach you to do that down to twenty four throw the or or take twenty four twenty five and throw it at the vet and then clean up this debt very very quickly it is absurd for you to have Seventy five thousand dollars in debt with a two hundred thousand dollar household income it was getting ready to bash all your\nLife or a couple of months ago and ah went on a on a life in a nice way to earn an eye on him or majority of\nOkay it's absurd that you make two hundred thousand dollars a year and you know twenty five dollars and that ...\n... ... you know you got to make enough money to have done this the right way you chose not to do it the right way so it's up to you guys but if you're going to do what we teach you know you would use this inheritance\nImmediately to become debt free so that you take all those famous as you don't have any more and you use those to build wealth with you have paid for home\nCorrect we we inherited it or not\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite\nWe heard it when I was like oh\nOkay All right and how much is in the inheritance in cash\nI I'm not quite a hundred or so about another somewhere north of ... Seventy five\nHundred and Seventy five thousand dollars correct okay and why she taking distribution says they're just taking it\nOn the ... we want her financial and her told her that she had to get a good in a disturbing to um [noise] um\nIs it cover or tax uh over they each year this year it at heart over at the most part because the way because the money out of town\nYou know it's a bunch of crap um the\nUh okay because anytime you start making decisions based on taxes instead of based on economics you make bad decisions so I don't know what this money's invested in but I Want to get control of this money and get it invested\n... when I Do I catch the whole thing out pay some taxes and I'm getting a different financial advisor and uh I Would pay off all the debt and I'm going to invest the rest of it\nOr in something that I can see control and know what it is in good mutual funds or in some paid for real estate or something like that I honestly don't think that's what\nYou all are going to do but that's what I Would do um because\nI think there's a lot of cooks in this kitchen\nThere's a lot of opinions flying around here and you guys have got to get inside this and as a couple decide what you're going to do and how you're going to handle money and then you start telling financial advisors what to do instead of them telling you what to do and it's a different different situations so I think she inherited the financial advisor to\nI don't think you picked him and um and that's really a bad medicine\nAs well Ninety percent of the time are you guys need to pick 'em or you need to re picking and hiring again and this time he works for you but I think he's still works for grandpa even grandpa was dead and and that's the way this stuff works usually bad bad medicine\nTravis what I Would do is catch the whole thing out pay off all my dad's and invest the money with what's left that's what I Would there and I would take your wonderful two hundred thousand lower income and become multi millionaires with it and that's what we've shown people how to do for almost three decades now\nHold on I'll send you guys are a couple a copy of the book the

month you'll save even more used to promote code Ramsey to get the best possible deal\nQuestion comes from Laurie in Iowa I was interested in opening a five twenty nine plan for my daughter she has autism so I may open an ... account instead would depending on the severity of or autism\nMy biggest concern is that I don't know what happens to the money to five twenty ninth planet if she doesn't go to college can you tell me what happens to money not used for education\nOr it will be if you don't transfer it to a sibling um it'll be heavily taxed in ... it'll be taxed\nAnd heavily penalize so um\nYou know the five twenty nine is not a good plan a for a child that you're not sure what's going to happen as far as their education is going to be and uh where you've got a special needs situation like this I Would usually able to count 'em and or I Would just use mutual fund\nJust blurted mutual fund and let it grow and then you can just take care of the child with that money you're just you're marking it for them for their future\nOr they may do a trade school they may do uh uh they may be able to do a full for your academic run 'em they may do a lot of things I don't know how the severity of this I don't know exactly what you're facing\nBut you simply going to save money it's as simple invest money in your name and you're controlling it and then you can decide to help your child however you want to\nThe only advantage of the table or the five twenty on it's just the tax advantage\nStill just an investment in a good mutual fund\nAnd the question is is at our as it grows is going to be taxed\nThat's the only thing so it's a it's an advantage if you have a real high probability of them doing our education\nBut again where you've got a a special needs situation most of the time I'm going to say just save it in a regular count saving it in a mutual fund if you want to use the cable that's fine that's what it's designed for you all kinds of stuff with that but it's a good plan but\nI probably would just keep it were and get my hands on it and I'm not a big deal either way the the thing the reason we push of our twenty nine just does two things uh ... in a traditional set your situation\nIt teaches you to brainwash your kid to go to college which is not a bad thing at all and the other thing is it allows that money to grow tax free and so it's a ... that's a wonderful benefit but is that ... is that the only possible way you can care for your child no\nInterest in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is ...\nIt's just in a more traditional situation it's the best way the most um you know the least taxes on the thing which is generally what we want to do um we're letting it grow but in this situation I I'm not the tax benefit is not worth the\nPension you in the corner and actually hitting you harder later I'm making you wish you just pay the taxes\nAnd and that's the way to work out open phones a triple\nEight eight to five five two to five ... on Twitter David I'm thinking about studying abroad next summer but the cost is at least five thousand dollars\nReally don't want to go into that um but I'll be out of college soon and this was once in a lifetime opportunity what should either was actors a hundred percent chance that they Ramsey is never going to tell you to borrow money\nFairly predictable I'm\nThirty years I've been doing this for almost twenty seven years I've been here and there are never told people to borrow money\n... if you want to go study route I suggest you get your motive job five thousand dollars would do just worked your little tail off\nAnd then go and enjoy your study abroad experience from pay cash for it and that way and we'll follow your home\nThere was a point um be amazed what you can be really really want to like for instance if I told you that you were going to die if you didn't say five thousand dollars\nYou could go work out as long as they're not die it's amazing what you can do when you really want to but I'm going to be a little lazy here and I'm just gonna borrow my way into a mess and I'm going to say well
