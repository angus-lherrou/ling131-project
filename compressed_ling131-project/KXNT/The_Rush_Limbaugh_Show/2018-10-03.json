became a subject for CNN or national and Chris ... we're talking with author Rebecca Traister about a new book good and mad the revolutionary power of women's anger\nRush Limbaugh says something completely predictable I'm going to play it and then let her read something that Steve Bannon said and he is considered the on screen the real politic today is the Rush Limbaugh first\nMilitant

thing or two about\nFor their stay in the same thing ... you just don't get it\nLet me clarify I'm not even talking about the me too movement I disagree the me too movement is going to become the Tea Party but I I because I don't I don't think that it's it's a organic and I don't think that it's\nI just don't think it has much in common with with what the Tea Party is or the or the Tea Party was up but there really isn't an aside from the explanation of what's going on Bannon and I are in total agreement here I don't think it's just sexual harassment I didn't get paid for the men and I said this\nAnd I'm I'm exploring the reasons why I think terrible things have happened to these women some of them over the course of their lives and they have become enraged and instead of just blaming the men who did what ever happened to them they're going to blame everything and I believe the country they're going to blame all man they're going to blame the founding\nWas true and now here's the

to see is the OJ FBI silent coup that was run against Trump on this\nBogus Russia can look at all of the allegations against Donald Trump they've turned out to be nothing nothing can be proven established nothing can be made on them and they have a never ending from the moment Trump got in the campaign\nWhen they really big things like Trump colluded with Russia maybe that's what we're finding the tax returns was all about I have to make this point again the left one of Trump's tax returns 'cause that was going to be the end they were going to be able to prove that is why Trump wouldn't release them remember they said it would prove that Trump's wild comes from Russia\nAnd that's why Trump is a potent storage\nThat Trump would be nothing if it weren't for putting in the

the late\nTeens by that time Kevin almost ... so foreigners re casting it'd be attached to the summer of any two is suspect and that happens after ... in other words this event if he had happened\nShe had all kinds of potential dates where it could have happened and every time she reported\nThis the date changed it became the summer of eighty two only after she began to consult with Feinstein staff and Anna Eshoo staff and her lawyer Deborah cats and I am convinced that they decided to claim the date was eighty two\nHer lawyer Deborah cats and I am convinced that they\n\nDecided to claim the date was eighty two so asked to coincide with where Kavanaugh might have been able to be placed\n\nShe still and this is fundamentally crucial she still cannot specify\nWhen Trump was right she can't specify where\nMeaning the house\nShe can't specify the time of day she doesn't remember how she got home the ... the floor playing for the house also changes\n\nShe ran out of a small bedroom door bathroom on one instance of the story in another and she ran out of a small bathroom into my living room family room combo room\n\nSo much of her story is fluid and the Democrats know everything that I'm telling you it doesn't matter because this is purely political it's not\nAbout sexual abuse it's political and therefore she is going to be believed did anybody you find it strange the minute she makes the allegation here comes a movie or a video of Hollywood actresses and all these Democrats senators I Believe her based on what\n\nWell not based on the necessity of believing or because this whole thing\nWas strategize this is what the left\nDoes meanwhile the country is being asked to feel so bad and so sorry for a woman who was so mistreated\nAnd don't forget\nEven the number of

a constituency who said I don't want to be known I don't want to be named and I don't want this taken any further\nWell then\nIt just it just it doesn't make any sense on the last\nYou put it in the proper context of what the express purpose of this is which I happen to believe is forcing Kavanaugh to resign to withdraw or for Trump to withdraw it and I think it was beginning to unravel because Trump and Kevin all have hung in and my unravel I mean be exposed\n\nFor the phone is that much of it is any weight Suzie I'm Glad you called thank you thank you very much Miami, Florida next Robert

the Mueller probe ... if you\nDon't well now that's an interesting question what's going on with the mother probably here's the latest I heard on the ... the the story actually has a sentence in it the\nSpecial counsel's office and Robert Mueller absurd us choir most in\nMost most honest man on the order what it is shedding prosecutors shedding process now when your cat or dog sheds it means losing hair a mother is losing prosecutors meaning\nThere were there during the jobs almost not in their ... their ... their moving away and they're going off to other things\nThere's less and less for his team of Trump haters to what to do I'll just repeat what I said at the very opening of the program I don't think this tax story would have run today\n\nIf Mahler we're still hot on the trail and had something and if the Ford story weren't beginning to unravel the New York times story wouldn't ... when I saw\nOn drudge this massive New York times during my first reaction is remember folks I Am a student of the media and the left\nAnd nothing happens by accident the times didn't just finished the story\nBy deadline last night there by making it able to be published they'd been holding it\nThey've been working on it for a year and they've been coordinating with the Showtime network they've been producing a documentary for the past year documenting how the times found it\nHow they reported it how they ... how they wrote it the fact that this thing was released and published last night for today\nFirst reaction I had was the cabinet thing must really be unraveling 'cause it's time now to turn attention to Trump from a new angle\nAnd it's not really new its taxes the latest news correct me on this Mr ... if you've seen somebody more recent but the last story I saw on this is Muller\nMr ... if you've seen somebody more recent but the last story I saw on this is that Mahler [noise] I don't know what to believe in that Muller is showing various people Roger Stone emails texts and asking them what they know about it\nWe're down now to Roger Stone\nIn an investigation that started with everybody thinking Trump cheated with Russia\nAnd Muller was the guy that was going to find it and when we got Trump's tax returns we were going to see\nThat it's important\nThat enabled Trump to hold onto his money and get more But Trump's wealth is directly tied to illicit activity when Russia will there isn't any Russian anything in the New York times story\nSo [noise] um [noise]\nWe're getting down to the nitty gritty I'd you know ethics say that a special counsel should not right and release a report within this close proximity to an election because of the impact that it would have and they of\nCourse are ah unbiased end of the only objective in the Justice Department and they're not about affecting the outcome of elections I\nWhich is all they've been trying to do it for two years I wouldn't be surprised if they released a report you know a couple of days before the election which excoriated Trump for irresponsibility excoriated for a bad attitude experience in for having a really really shady friends and all that but does it accuses them anything\n\nIf it's not supposed to happen before the election that's when it probably will happen\nIs the way these people operate but but maybe it won't outside of that\nI'm like everybody else I don't know what Mueller has I don't know what he's going to be a lot of what he's going to report um the zero not at\nAll I Know is\nThat the drive by media decided to try to make something else a bigger story today
