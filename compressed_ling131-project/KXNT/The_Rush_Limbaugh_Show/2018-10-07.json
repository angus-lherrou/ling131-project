wonder if I could put that carpet in the bedroom\nI don't see any reason that you couldn't do that um you know pulling the carpet up is pretty easy to do as long as it was put down correctly to begin with and I will caution you if that space\nIn the living room turns out to be not one piece of corporate ... carpet with seem in the middle of it that she could be your weak link\nAnd he met seem may not be obvious to you if it was done well to begin with but when he took the carpet up you may find that it's basically two pieces of all the wall carpet seems together would seem tape and then if you try to move the peace upstairs the tape could break apart because now you're kind of disturbing it\nAnd you may have a bit of a mess on your hands [laughter] but I see no reason why you couldn't use the carpets\nPossible that said I think the most expensive part of this project is going to be the labor because you're going to have to have a professional carpet installer do this work\nAnd considering the fact that the upstairs bedroom is fairly small the added cost of brand new carpet might not really that much to the overall project so think about the economics of this okay\nIf you're going to spend money on those dollar that's going to cost you X dollars to to have them come in to build carpet out kind of new piece of set upstairs move it upstairs how much more can the carpet possibly costs too especially if you bought a room that or something of that nature\nI say yeah I think it's one long piece I really\nDo it depends because usually the votes of carpeting or Thirteen feet\nSo if you've got a run of the room that's bigger than Thirteen feet than you know\nYou're probably going to have seen somewhere in there the other thing to consider is that twenty year old petting might not be reusable so you might have to get new patting whereas if you got new carpeting they're going to throw in padding for the most part so you know think of all those things\nAre a little bit of luck with that project gave me some stuff to think about it eight six six six three nine seven four\nWell if you save energy or not waste water you're probably and environmentally responsible shop are but when it comes to shopping for floors knowing how that Flora has made is really key to knowing if it's an eco friendly option for your home we've got tips on how to do just that in today's foreign hip presented by lumber liquidators\nNow there are two types of words that are generally considered to be the most eco friendly first there's court and it's a good choice for several reasons first of all it's sustainable\nThe looks great it lasts a long time and it's white now the flooring is made from the bark of the cork oak tree which is stripped every nine years and then it goes back and it looks no damage on the tree whatsoever\nNow bamboo is another great option than before and as manufactured from the band or plant which is actually a type of grass which makes them super sustainable\nThen but it's going to grow very very quickly and it needs a little water to thrive that bamboo is going to grow back within five to ten years as opposed to the thirty to one hundred years that it takes to grow traditional hardwood and that makes ... one of the most eco friendly foreign products available\nBut the other big advantage of bamboo is that it's really durable I mean during the manufacturing process strand bamboo becomes one of the hardest most durable natural boring options in the marketplace and even though bamboo is a grass it actually looks deals and most importantly you're kind of reforms just like aren't with\nMhm and it's gorgeous it's really a great choice\nAnd that's today's Florence have prevented by lumber liquidators where you'll find him

you have these rules\nGet as much insulation in the ceiling structure and because he rises and you've got that ceiling up there you're going to have a warmer second floor so how do you combat that well there's a couple of things\nOne of which is do you have ceiling fans up there right in the ceiling fans on helping or they pushing the warm air down to that or it can be cool in the summer\nIt killed\nOne of the things you might want to do is considering supplementing the second floor with a split duck with system or him and his foot Douglas\nIt's usually easier to do that then to overrun the air conditioning air conditioner should get the second floor cooler in the long run you use less energy that way\nSometimes in in a in the morning on the home designed you're going to get a warm area of the house that just can't get enough air delivered to it because of its design\nYou know in in my home I've got to an office on the west side of the house and it just happens to be pretty far from where\nThe air handler is and so it always stays a bit warmer and I put a split Douglas system in there and just to kind of supplement the central air we still have central air in the same space for the split duck with supplements it quite nicely does a really good job of keeping it very cool uncomfortable in those warm summer days so I Would suggest you consider that as an option here\nOkay now what it helped to like a ... you\nKnow because you don't have an addict you have an addict you have a procedure also there's no attic space there plus those uh exhaust his editor exhaust fans typically take as much air conditioning air out of the house and they do hot air because the depressurize the addict so much that they tend to draw down into the house and steals Americans there at

season right you've got pumpkin spice lattes\nYou've got to worry about the relatives coming into town and we all have to worry about making sure that we make the right decisions for healthcare especially folks\nWho are having to deal with their Medicare and you'll election period\nI Can't do this all by myself I needed approach to help me out with all the facts and figures I don't want to lead you're wrong so joining us is Mary Granger Humanae broker relations manager for Nevada thanks for joining us thank you for having me first of all let's start off a about and talking about the Medicare\nAnnual election period what's the time period that we're dealing with\nThank you for asking every year between October fifteenth and December seventh Medicare beneficiaries not just seniors you can have Medicare if you are disabled are invited to explore their health care options before they're locked in for another year\nAnd that's the whole key this this is the key because we all know about it whether you do a Medicare or whether you you do regular\nIt's that you and I were talking before he went on there and it's when you get locked in to a program it can be so frustrating and and honestly I think one of the problems that I run into when I'm doing my regular health care and I think people go through this with Medicare as well\n[noise] the time gets\nYou know smaller and smaller and all of a sudden the deadlines there and you're having to make a decision and you haven't done your homework on this issue or that issue and you are stuck and you you can't pull out for for an entire year so this is really one of the big things that we're trying to do to make sure that everybody makes the right decision\nI agree you don't want to make a rash decision although Medicare does have a few\n... periods that might allow you to change your mind for the most part you're locked in for a year\nSo all plants have been posted at Medicare dot Gov throughout the country and anybody on Medicare plan or considering the Medicare plan in the near future are encouraged to at least go to that site if not one of their favorite carriers like humanity\nAnd explore what the plants are and what they have now and make sure they have everything buttoned up come December seventh which is the last day to make an election for January one\nOkay so Wednesday October tenth one day only six AM to six PM what's taking place\nWe're going to have a Medicare cue and they tell us on we're going to offer state license insurance agents who are extremely well versed in\nHow humans human humans this is a virtual fly real people into\nPersonable people that will answer your questions without any pressure just to make sure that year in the right place at the right time\nI was once told it would be very wise to know a lawyer before you ever got put in jail and I think the same thing applies to insurance you want to make sure you have the right insurance package emotion God Forbid something catastrophic hit you or your find yourself in an emergency situation\nI Can't ... you know\nCount the number of times I've heard friends and family as well when something happens and you never know when something is going to happen\nWhen you wind up at the hospital it's\nToo late at that point you need to have all of this is why they call it insurance that you need really it's a safety net\nTo to just in case\nYou you want to make sure that nothing happens you try and take care of yourself get plenty of exercise and eat right and all that stuff but your body has its own a mind of what is going to\nDo and you need\nTo make sure that you do have that that kind of safety net like a circus performer or that you really have the feeling of to me it's it's just the feeling of tranquility that you know you've done the very best you don't have to be sweating it\nAbsolutely if we have\nThe luxury of time to plan a surgery or a minor procedure rarely does anything go wrong as far as insurance because the eyes have been ... been crossed and yes that hospital or provider is in my network and they will be paid but it's the emergencies that you need to prepare for well in advance\nAnd life is full of emergencies every day's an emergency\nOr so for a Wednesday Tobar tent rehab for one day only six AM to six PM\nWe want you to call in the right down this number and don't worry if you don't have a PIN right now or you're driving and and you need to pull over you have to do this when you go on because I'm going to be repeating it all throughout the show it's seven oh two seven six six nine one two three four\nSeven oh two seven six six nine one three four and ...\nA chance to write it down all you have to do this is even easier is go to our a K accident T. dot radio dot com website and just click on the Medicare help line a graphic that you see there there's a doctor\nAnd ... and we have all the information that you're going to be needing they're one of the the biggest problems that I have from you know what I'm doing my health care and I think a lot of folks shows why\nI'm sticking with that story I Believe are not alone or but especially some of our ah our seniors that are going in in in signing up for a for Medicare\nIt can be confusing and and sometimes it's in language that you don't understand or sometimes you're seeing as being like hold it if I Do this plan to do I have to do this and is this connected to that that's my big problem is when you click one button it cuts out another\nThat is very getting there is is half the battle we're talking with Mary Granger she is Humanae broker relations manager for Nevada talking about the Medicare and you'll election period and for one day one day only Wednesday October tenth\nFrom six AM to six PM or you're going to be able to call in and get all of your Medicare and questions answered and there's no question that's too stupid trust me I'm the guy who usually ask them the number that you want to call the\nSeven six six nine one three four seven oh two seven six six nine one two three four and don't forget Medicare's and you'll election period as October fifteenth\nThrough December seventh this will be taking place both for that period starts this will be on October tenth\nAnd the whole point of this really is to make sure that you have the information you have the tools you are armed you are filled with knowledge you know more than the website\nBy the time you go in and you start making sure that you've got all of the coverage that you need one of the little things that you had mentioned we were talking about the four sees the convenience care cost in coverage\nIs\nI went to the doctor this past year we go in quite a bit this one of those years we all have them we're just like okay what broke now a and that is if you have a situation that a doctor is looking at and you're going to come back in three days or a week or two weeks mentally I've decided this\nI've already done my co pay well no you're going back again and there's more and there's more and there's more you have to factor that in it's not like one one copay fits all\nCorrect and those co pays for office visit not for initial treatment and diagnose his yeah so you want to pay attention what is my maximum financial liability this calendar year should something happened\nAnd dying in and out of these offices or complex diagnostic survey cage or hospitals\nWhat are some of the questions that people should be asking if it if it's not on your you know starting off your list just to get going what are some of the basics that people should be wanting the answers to when they're making their Medicare and you'll election\nThey should be asking do I have full Medicare and by that I mean Medicare and be do I have a plan and doesn't meet my needs this year shit I explore for next year\nAnd by the way too because this will be me and I still do this when I hear the commercials and maybe you know the answer you don't if you don't know the answer asked the question no such thing as a stupid question what's the difference between a and B why do I need both isn't there see that covers all I mean you can ask anything they know the answer to\nExactly and that license agents that are receiving the cars are bilingual English and Spanish so they can fields lots of costs and lots of folks\nAnd when I was saying by the way they they speak in plain English I mean we're playing Spanish they just peeking is speak in plain language that you understand in it and it isn't over your head and here's the key to this is always really important and I'm Glad that these folks are doing this\nIs that if you don't understand if they say something that you don't get tell them\nJust stop and say I'm Sorry this just doesn't make sense to me it's okay they understand it's not the first time they've heard of before I Would do it I Would do it too because what you want to make sure as when you call these folks seven oh two seven six six nine one three four on October tenth\nSix AM to six PM\nThat you are armed you are feeling confident you're feeling sassy for a change you finally know what is going on ahead of time so you don't have to worry about this any more this is something that I've gone through two and I've been doing my health care\nIs that you think\nYou've done a really great job and then the year takes place and then you get those big surprises if you educate yourself ahead of time you don't have to worry or think or fret like is this going to be covered you're probably going to do more than the receptionist\nI like to look at insurance in a worst case scenario so I Know what I'm On the hook\nFor one time it's okay to be worse case scenario it was definitely half empty yes just\nTo make sure you have those proverbial ducks in a row um and there are several ways Medicare beneficiaries not just seniors can get Medicare the federal Medicare program is a beautiful program again it works from San Diego to Rhode Island in this eighty twenty fashion\nBut another way to get it or through these Medicare Advantage plans that were introduced in Nineteen eighty five and had been running strong since\nMedicare Advantage plans is when you hire a company like Humanae and they assign co pays to all of those Medicare benefits you would get when you flashier red white and blue card mhm but they reduce your financial obligations or\nUm level of expense God Forbid there was something catastrophic that happened and then they put in a whole bunch of extra I'd like to call it the advantage and Medicare Advantage\nTransportation services dental allowances for vision and eye glasses Medicare will ensure your eyeballs but they think guy glasses are a luxury they'll often have you on the\nWay the troops are run into it with my aunt before they do and just like why would this not recovered\nExactly science and commercial plants I think that's a huge assumption people entering Medicare think well it was covered on my employer plan so naturally it will be there and naturally is not right Medicare plans are different than commercial plants and you're going to want to ask those questions when you opt in\nJust in case it's not part of the plan maybe you're going to need exploring different insurance or additional insurance besides this but Medicare Advantage plans will give you exactly what Medicare does an ad quite a few additional benefits\nOftentimes for no monthly premium other than the cost of your anti intimate care\nOr again we're talking with me a merry Granger shoes Humanae broker relations manager for Nevada talking about this and that is going to be taking place of Medicare help one of going to take place before this is important before the Medicare and you'll election period so when you go in and you start making your decisions\nOf between October fifteenth and December seventh you are so well armed it's taking place five days before the election period starts it's going to be Wednesday October tenth\nFrom six AM to six PM one day only and you can call and get literally anything answered that you need at seven oh two seven six six nine one two three four\nLet's talk about how people can learn is it going up to this dissident taking place how they can kind of arm themselves a little bit more what other ways can they get more information what websites\nThank you so naturally Medicare dot Gov a ... it's Medicare time dot com and every state in our United States has what's called a ship program yellow pages white pages you\nCan find a way this morning on my on my porch your Medicare book uh no my my wife pages oh go ahead and see what I was looking at is in there it is in\nThere it is in there and then every Medicare beneficiary today should be receiving if not already a Medicare new handbook you can also find them at the libraries and the Social Security office\nOr it looks a recap some of the things that we have been talking about in case folks have been missing this or they wanted to do sometimes on these things are repeated actually everyday things repeated to be quite honest with you who\nIs there going in to this period maybe they haven't signed up before maybe they just need a a a reminder\nIf anybody has any doubts about their Medicare eligibility they should call Social Security but most people who are us citizens or have worked in the United states for at least ten years\nThey may qualify for Medicare and anybody who has Medicare part a and B may explore one of these Medicare Advantage plans come October Fifteen\nAll right and then also we know most of us when we're doing our health care and I think this the supplies most of the time there's some outs in
