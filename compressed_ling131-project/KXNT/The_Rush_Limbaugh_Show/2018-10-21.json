well Rubio with your host the best selling author Chuck Oliver is mission is helping you discovered and uncovered your hidden wealth protect yourself from taxes inflation and marketing lawsuit\nAnd now here's John [noise] by this junk out are welcome the hidden wealth radio well we're talking\nTax folks and for those of you listening that you're concerned about your taxes\nFolks you should be um I'm going to talk to you about the biggest trap that prevents baby boomers from having the retirement outcome that they could have that ends up being different because of not having a proven tax savings strategy to save them the most unnecessary tax\nFolks I Want to share with you that what you do now has to be in in in implemented before the end of Eighteen for you to save taxes\nFor twenty eight team and why I think this is so important\nUh you know I'm I'm somebody that writes books and has national radio show but I I work with a certain number of clients each and every year and a half now going on twenty three years in the financial arena\nThat I've seen firsthand the uninformed and I think a former federal judge hand said it best he said you know in America there are two tax systems one for the informed and one for the uninformed both\nAre legal and I think this article kind of says it all so if you're somebody listening and you save money towards retirement let's say a couple of hundred thousand or more typically for those of you listening to save money in tax deferred accounts meaning the it hasn't been taxed yet 'til you take it out\nYou should have some concerns and and I'll tell you why because there's so many tax traps that the government's counting on you believe me they're counting on you in a big way and it's what I write about my books you become unnecessarily the perfect taxpayer\nYou see one of the articles out this week says why retirees tax rates may be higher than they expected says higher income retirees may see their tax brackets fall\nBut still face higher levels or levies of tax because of ... tax on their Social Security or tax on their Medicare part B and de right through the form of higher premiums considering the additional taxes many will see a marginal tax rate that could jumped as high as forty percent\nOf folks think about it in in in at a time when the greatest tax cut is ever been passed and our country's history people are going to face higher taxes\nAnd it's like I've said for years with the government give us the government taketh away and you've got to be informed right if you're going to save the most you've got to be informed the most talked about a few clients like yourselves friends and neighbors other boomers that have basically said well you know\nWhat we've been talking about taxes and here's why that's so important the windows are still save tax is still open but folks it's closing very very quickly because what you do in twenty eight team has to be implemented in twenty team\nFor you to say tax in twenty teens and the reality is this the tax sale that we have with this new tax reform bill as great as it is is causing a lot of problems in his ultimately causing people more tax which I'll teach you but the tax sales only good through twenty twenty five and then it goes away\nSo the time to act as now ride like any sale you want to take advantage of sale before the sale expires well every year leading up through the end of twenty twenty five is the opportunity to reduce your taxes the most because what you do this year and have a dramatic impact\nOf how much less tax you pay for this year and next year forward fact we've been talking about an article that was out that this rather alarming and I see this again I I Am not just the best selling author or national radio educator I'm somebody that works with clients individually baby boomers and business owners and have now for over Twenty years\nAnd the number one trap for those that have worked the hardest that of save the hardest and ultimately and accounts that haven't been taxed yet like for one case in IRAs right those to be listening to save save two three four five hundred thousand or more in retirement accounts\nYou become what I call them my books is that found through my experience the perfect taxpayer because unfortunately the government has a better tax plan for you then you have for them\nAnd I think a former federal judge by the name of learn hand said best he said you know in America there are two tax systems one for the informed and one for the uninformed both are legal\nFolks now's the time right or the sale goes without saying but what you ... the ideas what you get done this year is what has to be implemented this year in order for you to save the tax for this year forward and you can eliminate\nYou ... the ideas what you get done this year is what has to be implemented this year in order for you to save the tax for this year forward and you can eliminate the government from your taxes or reduce the amount that they take from you and the reality is this right the the\nThere was an article out this week that said the tax cut isn't paying for itself\nNow think about that because the Treasury Department just released figures this past week showing that the federal budget deficit wind by Seventeen percent\nOr to over seven hundred and eighty billion dollars\nWhich is an unusual jumped the article goes on to stay out of New York times in in within a year in which the unemployment hit a five decades low in the economy experienced significant economic expansion right but the increased demonstrates that the tax cuts signed into law last year have reduced federal revenues considerably\nEven right against the backdrop of a booming economy now think about this before the federal the congressional budget office pass the tax cuts a few months before it passed they predict the government would take in three point five three trillion in revenue\nThis past Monday the treasury reported that the revenue was actually only three point three three trillion eight two hundred billion dollar shortage folks guess where they're going to get the shortage from\nI think you're probably guessing yourselves and if you're guessing yourself you'd be right especially those of you listening that have worked hard and save hard in tax deferred accounts like four one K. is IRAs for three days et cetera folks that doesn't need to be that way and the question becomes what have you done\nTo have a tax savings solution plant right not an ... everyone can say they have an accountant right serve you share with me while I had no idea about they said well tax saving solutions you guys are tax planners\nNot tax accountant such as a big difference between people that know what boxes to check in what dates that that there needs to be meeting deadlines\nOr you can do that on line folks\nAh but there's a difference of getting strategy is specially like we do with our clients and have for years before in that fourth quarter is vital to have reviews to know exactly what steps can be taken to strategize to legally reduce morally and ethically not just legally reduce your taxes for that\nActual tax year\nAnd folks the windows closed and very very quickly but the opportunities still there and I'll tell you where it becomes so important you know ten thousand people retiring a day and is this article goes on to say which I think is rather alarming says why retirees tax rates may be higher than they expect\nRight is is high in higher income retirees and they see their tax brackets fall\nBut still face higher levies of taxing the form of taxes on Social Security benefits and higher premiums for Medicare part B in the in fact it said considering those additional taxes right there marginal tax rates could jump to be as high as forty percent or more\nNow think about that in in a year that we ... the first year implemented of the greatest tax cut in our country's history\nMany retirees taxes are actually going up and folks I see it first hand I've witnessed it I can talk to you about a few clients that that hit home that we just met with this past week right so for example\nUh I think of Marty and daddy okay and mommy and daddy had no idea about having up to eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed\nRight but they also didn't realize that they could actually zero out their entire taxable income for two thousand and eight team with just one of our kid well tax saving solution strategies\nIt could actually zero out their entire taxable income for two thousand and eight team which is one of our kid well tax saving solution strategies and they were able to do that\nI think ... um they had some highly appreciated assets that they sold this year and as a result of that was exposing them to a massive capital gain some of you may be the same we rented a lot of clients have sold now the real estate's come back they sold off\nOf the you know fully depreciated out rental property or commercial building a or a business and the capital gain is pretty sizable\nAnd unfortunately that game then gets transferred onto their ten forty and then it's looked upon to determine then how much of that as as a taxable income is then going to subject taxing their Social Security\nHow much of the as an example of they're required minimum distribution\nThat for those of you listening that's when you hit Seventy and a half some of you that er Seventy half knew exactly what I'm saying that the government then forces you to take a certain percentage of the universal percentage formula out of all the totaling of your I raise that you have one or more however many you have there and take the total\nAnd then force you to take out a distribution if you don't take it it's a fifty percent penalty of what the distribution should have been\nIn folks I just met with a client this last week whose requirement of distribution was almost Ninety thousand dollars\nBecause he waited and waited and waited he deferred deferred deferred and now the day of tax reckoning his hit him and as a result now in it he at AT and his wife at eighty eight they're paying more taxes in retirement\nThan the amount of taxes that they pay to their highest wage earning years books we see this time and time again but the good news is it doesn't have to be that way also think of mark and Donna\nWho legally untaxed their IRAs right so they they took money out of virus but they they that's a district distribution of of of tax exposure but they used another section of the code with the hidden well tax saving solution to them directly offset that tax with a tax deduction\nIn essence zeroing out the tax liability on their IRAs which means they will have those\nPesky required minimum distributions because there before the age of Seventy and a half which is the ultimate goal is not to have requirement distributions for those of you listening to have requirement of distributions let me talk to you about Mick mix somebody that had requirement of distributions and we actually eliminated\nHim ever having another requirement of distribution by using a proven tax savings solution this year in twenty eight team folks are you ready\nFor the taxes are going to pay in twenty four twenty team\nOr are you ready to see how much unnecessary tax you can avoid for twenty team right one of the most important steps that people can take is getting inform Dr taxes are on sale folks but they're not going to be on sale for long back Andrew shelling said don't wait to get ready for the twenty Nineteen tax season right\nAvoid making huge tax mistakes ahead\nOf the next year right or a head of retirement even goes on to say to validate seniors are likely to pay unnecessary taxes and retirement if they fail to avoid making financial mistakes before they retire\nAccording to marketwatch to improve their future right clients should not assume that they're going to move into a lower tax bracket and they should avoid ending up being forced to have a high or large required distribution because that sets off a triggering of other forms of taxation right\nAnd when you have more money in your pocket and let's go into the government folks that's money for you to use for your grandchildren for your travels to visit and do the things you can do while you're still allows you to do them and don't forget what judge hands said right because it's true\nFor travel to visit and do the things you can do while you're still allows you to do them and don't forget what judge hand said right because it's true and I've seen it I I'm somebody that you're listening to that for years overpaid unnecessary taxes and then got super serious\nAbout learning what the ultra wealthy do and what the tax savvy due to pay my legal least required amount share and unpatriotic folks I have no problem paying tax I just have a problem paying tax not required to pay and he said it best you said you know in America there to tax systems one for the informed one for the uninformed but both are legal\nFolks get informed here's the opportunity [noise]\nI'm going to give those of you that are very curious to say how much tax in my overpaying or how much unnecessary tax can I be avoiding and especially for those of you that are likely predicting your taxes are going to be higher in ... maybe you sold highly appreciated asset\nOr maybe you you this was the first year you had your requirement um distribution maybe some of you this is the first year you elected your Social Security maybe that's some of you ... have not requested or locked in your application or choice excuse me of election of Social Security because\nPatients of the volatility of the S. and P. five hundred that's the gold standard of what all of the wall street money managers aspire to get as close to in performance but long term none of them ever have that is what we called investing\nAnd there's a distinct difference between investing and indexing and I'm not talking predominantly about an indexing type of an annuity some people confused that\nThese are techniques that the ultra wealthy of used for years that I was fortunate to learn almost Twenty years ago and have applied for my own family that has saved our bacon\nAnd the safe so many other clients that we felt now for over these period of years and the time is upon us folks are the key is not being too little too late because many people unfortunately won't have time to recover\nSeat or CNBC came out there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts watching the charts right with the u._s. stock market in the midst of an October sell off some Wall Street ... chart watchers are worried the situation could only get worse\nCNBC also had this last week they're warning signs a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go a the a warning for boomers this was out of NASDAQ dot com what will happen to retirement savings and the next market crash\nAnd then sadly Fox News reported that both Amazon and Facebook just on this past Wednesday plummeted\nTo the worst day in seven years I could go on and on folks but I think you get the picture\nAnd let's review what we do to solve the stock market loss risk by first looking at some facts right last month\nWe at that actually under the longest Bull Run in history being at about nine and a half years no bull market has ever made it to its tenth birthday I've been preaching this the second longest bull market was the dot com right the tech boom and bust of the nineties which caused investors to lose nearly eighty percent\nAnd while there's no guarantee obviously that the bull market will crash officially right uh [laughter]\nUnfortunately the bank that many people think that this and that's my next market correction is going to cause will not be a whimper\nAnd as the experts who study behavioral finance note again and again we humans have an enormous capacity for getting you know for for getting per se the lessons that pain of past crashes caused as many people are still folks I see this on a weekly basis are woefully unprepared\nFor the next downturn right Peter shift as some of you are familiar with Peter uh he says the U.S stock market crashes long overdue but people are oblivious right now the exit its biggest game this past month since the year two thousand right as I said history has a way of repeating itself [noise]\nBack in the two thousand peak though it hit for many people from the trough in eighty percent loss\nRight now think about that so the fact that we haven't had a month this strong being the prior month\nSince two thousand should give people pause which we've been preaching day in and day out\nIt's long overdue Peter says\nIt can start at any minute which obviously this last week proved that people are oblivious in fact Jim Rogers who's and investment commodities guru with one of the longest positive return track records on Wall street said we're heading towards the worst ... excuse me bear market of his lifetime\nHe says when the problem in the stock market is going up is based on a slew of misconceptions about the U.S economy when reality sets in Peter says you're going to see the U.S market tank and folks whether it tanks whether it corrects whether it crashes the reality is\nSee the U.S market tank and folks whether it tanks whether it corrects whether it crashes the reality is retire your risk\nOf stock market downturn right create your own protected pension plan have peace of mind of having a secure\nFuture cash flow for your retirement income that won't be disrupted when the next market crash or correction comes now or when it comes later\nRight in ... and please be advised to stay away right of one of them are shared how much he had lost by being advised you're listening to more of a TV personality posing as a fraudulent financial investment advisor advice\nThat ended up costing him a ton of money and I won't name names but we kind of call it the entertainment channel of folks that are telling what to buy and sell in fact this particular a\nFraudulent financial advisor investment advice giver a TV personality said uh two days before Bear Stearns a celebrating its ten years of going under back then two days before said by all of Bear Stearns that you can\nLook somebody has a crystal ball that's why you can play it safe and have upside without downside now the second biggest boomer concern is not just number one as a as a reminder having a stock market protection plan but also having a tax\nProtection plan you see how you can eliminate unnecessary taxes is indirectly the form of getting a better return right if you're not giving up ten twenty thirty forty who knows where tax rates go fifty percent that's better than earning ten twenty thirty forty fifty percent\nAnd that's a given not a an assumption and avoid the government tax scheme folks because the government's gotta tax game I I can assure you they do\nSee a time in in in in in time again where people don't know what they don't know where as I like to say you can't be aware of something you've never been made aware of and they get exposed to now becoming what's called the perfect taxpayer they did everything right they differed their tax deferred accounts of their company for one care for three bees\nAnd then they hit that day of reckoning when they are forced to take require distributions or if they start taking distributions out of their irate early they then expose up to eighty five percent of their Social Security being taxed\nAnd then depending on how much tax they have to pay by the distributions they're forced to take or that they decide they have to take\nThen they can ... expose themselves to paying penalties on their Medicare part B and deep premiums but it never stops there the end up not realizing they're leaving a major tax burden inheritance to their kids\nIn fact one client shared I Know why you Charles Oliver reside in the state of Florida is a no brainer way to save taxes on a state tax level\nAnd folks we helped numerous\nPeople in numerous states and yes there are many opportunities ah by choosing one of the nine states that has no state income tax as a start right let me share with you the biggest over payment of tax traps the boomers face\nRight now right in fact a money talk at a an article out saying one of the the top golden rules for retiring rich one of which is you can imagine was minimize your taxes\nYou know it goes on to say the rich stay rich because they are savvy enough not to let Uncle Sam take too much of their money in America ... former federal judge Leonard hand said there are two tax systems one for the informed\nAnd one for the uninformed however both are legal folks when you look at the fact that the hill just reported that our deficit is already sorts seven hundred and eighty two billion just year to date and twenty Eighteen right and the overall federal deficit sword Seventeen percent and fiscal year\nThese sorts seven hundred and eighty two billion just year to date and twenty Eighteen right in the overall federal deficit sword Seventeen percent and fiscal year uh Eighteen stuff's far right according to the congressional budget office you tell me where you think taxes are heading\nYou think taxes are heading higher where do you think taxes are heading lower and the big question becomes are you ready\nFor your twenty team tax where you're twenty Nineteen tax no some of you can still say tax for twenty eight teams there are proven hidden wealth solution tax savings technique techniques that were helping people with on a weekly basis but it's also then the tax bill you're going to face in twenty Nineteen for the decisions that you have to make\nIn twenty Eighteen so here's the opportunity I'm going to be teaching this coming Tuesday\nAnd I'm going to be teaching an educational weapon are now a couple of things that you understand this Web and are how you can have upside without downside to have stock market correction protection but also how you can have hacks\nProtection from unnecessary government tax game tax loopholes now these aren't a deceitful their legal ethical and moral but many people have said oh my gosh I had no idea until I took the time to investigate\nRight what I needed to learn that no one had ever taught me but I just had this with the client this week uh an educator has been in the educational system for years said you know none of the advisors I met with the physician my retirement even talk about taxes\nAnd none of them are when I asked them about how you can have upside double digit potential returns with no downside exposure ah they wanted to classify that as an annuity and said well those those ... are kept like three or four percent growth focused not annuity\nSo she said I'm so glad I took the time to investigate it through your educational process and here's the

don't do that so mentally it was okay I got to stay quiet I Can't say anything okay I got to be much you can use the ready for that and I think the athlete as well they don't want it made it that either\nAnd be able to bring that safe surface to the floor every Wednesday or ... for instance you know\nBringing it up and just being around like minded people and that's a huge reason why we don't have the civilians in there and we don't have significant others in there we don't have therapist and they're either you know it's that\nIt's time to just put your phone away and just be with your

does just that emerge veterans\nProfessional athletes together you know when you go through an BP's Instagram page you're gonna see pictures of course Randy towards big laser ... Boyer who are involved with it some of the athletes that have come out\nI've got one up now little video on tier ... well through a champion of the U.S see when people ask like you know what's it like being around these guys and you say you're working out I mean are you doing some sparring with Tyrone Woodley or things like that [laughter] how would you describe the workouts are ... and the interaction with these these famous athletes at the MVP functions\n... it's it's [laughter] it's obviously a dream come true um if it's something that you go in there and you're wondering who's going to be in that\nUm I've gotten to be coached by Sylvester Stallone for instance and um he was there that they actually got hired as well I have a tattoo on my chest that says lip for nothing diet for something which still has her slow and actually says in the last round of movie and he's on the couch and I sat there like that so that's there and I would like a\nI have a cat too of what she had on my chest and you know at first when I walked in there it was\nVery nerve wracking but then when you really get to know these people and actually talking to them because they they actually because of the leadership role that myself and I'm like I AJ that we work with and Jake up basically when they start opening the eight trust\nUs so they'll come into the back office and they'll just start talking to us in this building there that still is you know even if it's if any of them they all come to us because they trust and it's it's a whole different\nPerson the people that you see on TV [noise] yeah a lot of time for that for summer you know and then when you actually get to have that heart to heart with them and actually get to know them on a personal level\nThey're completely different person than what the media does for persuade them to be a lot of the time so you visit them hanging out with them you know walking in and Tyrone will these right there and he'll stop his work out saying what's up rather how you doing how's that we said you know how they will be ...\nAnd it's cool to be able to walk in there and build up again you know that that's how I felt when I was in the military that's how a lot of sports athletes bill as well you know you need that love sometimes and somebody to sit there and say how are you doing and it feels good that these people are stopping I mean you know a lot of time\nWell you know you need that loves sometimes and somebody that sit there and say how are you doing and it feels good that these people are stopping I mean you know a lot of times we'll stop what worked or for that now it's kind of turn around and when we walked in there it's just a family family atmosphere now\nDenver if people are out there and hearing about this if they're in the Las Vegas or Los Angeles area and they say hey this is something that sounds interesting to me I'm a combat veteran this was kind of thing I'd like to get involved in what do they have to do to to get involved with MVP\nYeah just go to ... or a click on contact us and send us an email I'm I actually reply to emails within ten minutes or so not a normal and let them sleeping [laughter]\nGo straight to me personally and I I Try to reply back to everybody I I'd let them go hey you know where do you live I I I started personal conversation with them and a lotta organizations they have that automatic\nIt shows up to what was it that influenced their decision and and and all cause them to make that the the choices that they did\nA for DOD as as as work pretty hard to put out information both on their websites are for for folks to be able to get a information on the blended retirement system in order to opt end of the new system the individual service member has to go through a multi stage or training or a\nSession that did ask them multiple times as they go through it are you are you sure you want to opt in but it's sort of service members got to do that on their own says really ... I don't see where the opportunity for someone to put pressure on them ... would really come about but\nOne day they have to go through that and then at the end when they do make their decision to come into the new uh to ... if they choose to opt into the new uh B. R. S. the ... the decision once it's made his or a vocal ... so that's why I think deities really maintains a\nPush for it and and and put out at a training program in and that's one of the things we want to evaluate how really how good was that training program to ensure that service members are informed about the new system and also the spouses can get on and look at this information as well\nOr through a a a number of sources uh to find out what what it is because again spouse or going to be really ah important in making this dishes and along with her service member about what they should do and whether they should whether or not they should opt into this new system\nOr the but again going through that training program\nOr we're gonna we'll find out I think for them based on our survey how well that was done I'll adequate that was that information was and then really what at the end uh made their decision what and when we ask them a number of questions related to that was it was it the DOT training program that made you helps you make your decision was at your spouse was that\nYou know a mentor someone somewhere some other service member was it some kind of a financial incentive you learned about on the program made you decide to change or to ... that that made you decide to stay with the legacy system so we got we were hoping to find out a lot of information based on this survey so we really wanted it would really want to do is try to get\nA this survey taken by a number of as many folks that we can out there in the currently serving active in reserve component us we can get a pretty good idea uh on this and we've asked number of organizations also to partner with us to help us get that out there are in the widest a distribution possible\nWe're speaking with Mike Baron Mike retired from the army after Thirty years and is currently serving is the director of currently serving him retired affairs government relations for military officers association of America ... a ...\nWe talk about this survey what is the end goal of it what do you hope to do with that information that you gather from the survey as the programs already initiated that's not going to be changed is is more to\nProvide data an insight for future programs that are similar or the implementation of future programs or what do we think is that it will be useful for\nI think it's going to help helps provide a number of those uh those answers there as well but it's going to give us a good a good perspective regarding the implementation in the decision making process that service members went through an in it are getting really focused in on his opt in years this one time up in year\nI'm ... and also how well or the education program was implemented by DOD I'm used to give us some pretty good feedback on that but again most importantly\nYou know what made what went into that uh you know that that decision making process of the service members who are eligible to stay on the legacy system or to move on into the into the ... the IRS enterprise we think that kind of information and we're going to be sharing that once we get all that will want to share that information pretty widely as well\nThis could be the feedback we get a well we're going to share this obviously it was ...\nOf information and we're going to be sharing that once we get all that\nWill want to share that information pretty widely as well this could be the feedback we get a well we're going to share this obviously was DOD as well and we when we do we talk with ... very regularly the folks that are that are implementing the or the new retirement system and there's often year and we want to share this information with them I think it's going to reduce the number of answers back in terms of\nUm again the decisions here how well this you know moving forward on this and if you took place\nAnd if it if it went really well and we can provide you know again that from the ... the survey and build it back to you know do you think of something that we can use in our discussions with them moving forward on other programs that are being implemented maybe do something if we need to similar to this that allows that the kind of a transition if you will over into a new system\nYou can find you know take the survey I Am also a a gospel\nComing up how can you as a veteran that sell yourself to
