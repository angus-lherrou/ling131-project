exact opposite it's just more in a smear\nThat the Democrats on the left of engaged in and Trump does not back down from it and even as I say for Riley magazine was stunned\nThat Trump got away with dominating even with these questions a couple of more before the break up next she says do you think that climate change is a hoax\nSuck I think something's happening something's changing and it'll change back again I don't think it's a hoax I think there's probably a difference but I don't know that it's manmade I Will say this um\nI don't want to give trillions and trillions of dollars I don't want to lose millions and millions of jobs I don't want to be put in a disadvantage I Wish you can do it in Greenland\nWatch these huge chunks of ice just falling into the oceans raising the sea level and you don't know whether or not that would have happened with or without man you don't know\nExactly and you don't know that it doesn't happen all the time anyway you don't know when it started you don't want to and did you don't know how natural it might be\nBut did you hear her say that the chunks of ice falling into the ocean or raising sea levels I remember one time on this program way way back in the nineties discussing this in fact there are two things\nThe first I pointed out because I have read it and the Heritage Foundation are actually report that this was during the spotted owl earth first a natural forest station\nControversy that was all part of a global warming craze in the early nineties and I pointed out\nThat there were more acreage there was a more acreage of trees are more trees in America then in Nineteen Ninety ... act our founding\nThe left ... fatty they said I was insane that couldn't possibly be true that we had come along and we and chop down trees and we haven't replaced them and make things out of the trees and they thought I was just insane I pointed\nOut you people misunderstand something yeah we cut down a lot of trees but you know what we plant for trees this is the wood industry they need what right how do you get what you have to grow trees\nIt's not a finite resource and for every tree that's cut down for new ones are planted it's part of the policy warehouse there is one of the big companies that was doing this they wouldn't they wouldn't listen to what that didn't compute they couldn't begin to fathom that\nThey couldn't understand anybody seriously claim more trees more forest more forested acreage in Nineteen Ninety two then there was in the Seventeen hundreds\nDidn't make sense to them 'cause they don't understand capitalism or economics everything zero sum game if a company came along and dropped out a bunch trees to build a bunch of houses or whatever and and that's that was trees that were gone forever it's why they don't want your cutting down the redwoods never come back you know I'm\nThe same token I remember saying it's still true today there was another report just last week that there are more trees\nForested acres in America today than there were even fifty years ago the second one was when when I um when I pointed out that's a falling ice from us\nWas when when I um when I pointed out\nThat are falling ice\nFrom a glacier or light green is going to raise sea level I said it's like ice in a glass melting I said it's not going to raise the sea levels I said those ice cubes being jumped into the ocean and not going to\nRaise ... you're crazy it's crazy it's ... you know what you're talking about of course it's going to raise it no it doesn't\nGet a glass eyes and for some water in it filled up Philip Glass in ice\nPut as much ice in there as you can and filling up with water yeah I was going to melt you tell me what the glass overflow\nIt will not\nThe volume is the volume a bunch of ice chunks\nFalling off a glacier are in no way capable of raising sea levels it's too massive it's too big but it's all about they thought you know what you're talking about the other side you can see that\n\nTrump's his right to say we don't know if it's natural or not but we sure as hell and not the ones causing and if somebody gave you the order okay you need to make ten percent of Greenland now and have the ice follow what would you do to make that happen to think about what\nWould you want to she was always at work but he I have never closes Fifteen hours a week

I was not familiar with the case or anything like that um but that wasn't that wasn't really the the the powerful peace about it but I guess the\nThe\nWhat what made it what made everybody if they were all feeling like me and all sitting down and not moving after the movie was over [noise] was it was it was about an abortion doctor yes but this this was a movie about a murder trial\nAnd but during the murder trial the um there there were two there were there were two things that were portrayed and one was just the bar verity of what happens in those clinics but\nEven more than that was was that the white level what was the barbarian and what happened in the clinics oh the bar verity of what happens in an abortion clinic when\nNo no in God's nails in God's nails clinic what happened what was the\nOh that uh that he was he was allowing babies to be born and then after they were born then he would kill\nExactly that is the vast majority this is why he's called the biggest serial killer in American history God's now killed most of the babies after they were born alive\nAnd he did it by sniffing they're spinal cords with scissors now I didn't say this on friday I didn't say

generated graphics there there's not a lot of\nA special effect a real or computer generated in order to shock because of the story tells itself the numbers\nOf children born alive killed by this man is stunning\nThe numbers of children born alive killed by this man\nIs stunning and shocking then you realize that the mainstream media never even covered the trial much less whether you're done they've always done their best to suppress it it was nearly impossible to get this movie main precisely because of what it revealed\nHollywood doesn't want this movie made the actors in this movie were risking their future careers by taking it rolled people like Nick Searcy who um a is a ... and across the board actor he can take the lead they can take a supporting role he can take or [noise]\nWhatever you want he chose to direct this movie and all of these people in one way or another we're risking something major by tackling ... and doing it they couldn't find funding people that run the Gulf funding pages would not allow\nAny kind of public funding for the production costs a Facebook Twitter I don't know specifically which one that they wouldn't allow any\nAs Facebook would not allow any kind of a promotion reference or fundraising for this at all is actually kind of a little essay amazing or miraculous buddy if it was it was a lot of hard work at a lot of time\nTo get this movie made but\nAnd it was a real challenge for them but how how difficult is it\nJust focus on the fact that this abortion is did his murderous work outside the home he did his share of of ah of abortions in the world but the numbers of born alive that this man murdered\nIt's just stunning you know everybody thinks late term abortion is bad and by the way this kind of abortion and it's called an abortion\nIf you if it's got a term I'm having a mental block and with the term of this is ... in Illinois and so forth when when the procedure came up with a bill was sponsored to stop this I think it was but rock Obama who refused to support it\nThe left will not support any limits whatsoever on whatever is called an abortion and the the ... the ... that's the thing the leftist tried to
