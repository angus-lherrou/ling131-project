could be\nBut that's just my wild guess one thing about these storms are reporting a wins in a hundred and fifty miles an hour and they just showed a neighboring city is and what the wind gusts ... the highest wind gust right now around sixty four\nSixty five miles an hour in the Panama City Panama City beach area these one hundred and fifty miles an hour winds are in the ... they are not the entire storm a I have not tried to to to minimize the impact here it's just that the reporting on these storms\nAnd the education on these storms in general is I think one thing it's whacking\nSuch as the way they colorized the graphics of these storms to make it look like hell on earth when any any hurricane the strongest wins are in the eye wall and a little\nYou know extended from it\nBut there's not too many places are going to get a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds\nIt'd be twenty miles depending on the size of the I Will not from there it'll fall off nothing nothing a\nHundred and twenty five is no slouch if you think that you've experienced Seventy five mile an hour winds well that's not bad like and it's the effect of a hundred and fifty versus other Seventy five months is not twice\nWhen you're in it if there is a multiplier effect\nOf massive wind speed so that if if the fastest the highest winds you've been in as Seventy five miles an hour and you think OK\nA cat for its gonna doubled is it won't it on the ground miles per hour it is but the impact of a hundred and fifty mile an hour winds versus Seventy five the just the destructive capability alone is a factor of three or four\nOr five hundred and fifty miles an hour is dead serious that that's where the storm surge will be or the worst of it the further you get from the high of depending on the structure the the more the wind speed\nDecreases the rainfall pretty consistent throughout a much larger area of the storm but the devastating the worst wins of the storm\n\nAre only in the eye wall area and people can look at these storms in the graphics while a hundred and fifty miles an hour winds all that's all I met her whole career in it now it is it not trying to downplay the or the damage I've just I've learned all this uh we live in hurricane alley here\nAnd every time one of these things I moved here in Nineteen Ninety seven and I quickly became a consumer hurricane expert I became an expert in how to interpret and watch the media I became an expert in how to analyze the graphics that they use\nAnd I became an expert in where the actual worst damage of a hurricane is you'd do not want to get a direct hit everybody well yeah of course Russia everybody knows that yeah but but outside the direct\nHit the damage or the strength of the of the hurricane diminishes quite a bit it's always the direct hit that that\nIs the most destructive and then it it starts to decline as you get away from me I depending upon the\nStrength of the storm does is going to have a wide destructive swat as a as a category for a here's Governor Scott of Florida this was this morning a press conference audio soundbite number one just to give you a taste of how local officials in the

were you amazed ...\nI just keep hearing that the suburban women has completely left Republican Party and that was the exact opposite of what I witnessed left side of the political\nMonk and imagine you were surprised if you have you been buying into the idea that the women have Republicans because of abortion and Trump being a massage therapist and all that then you show up at a Trump rally and it's it's at least fifty percent women I can imagine it'd be a little boondoggle by that\nIt was I I don't know if you got any feedback from any other Trump rallies that you get feedback from but\nWhat about what about housing but you said mothers and daughters were the husbands there could you detect the men were husbands or are they are\nThe guy that I was sitting next to a broad his daughter he took a lot of small dates which brings daughter I was just amazed that ... that I don't think that there's any massage any whatsoever of the Republican base I think that\nOf course there isn't this idea that this Republican war on women is a completely manufactured ally\nAnd of course their buddies in the left alone gladly accept an allegation is fact and an act on it you know we needed to show a pattern here is Kristen Smith of Ohio your next I'm Glad you're waited high\nHigh ... very very cool to talk to you thank you um so\nI was just wondering I was concerned and money to get your thoughts you mentioned it's a little bit yesterday but with this mob rule as it is and with Hillary claiming that they're partying neatness civility right now I'm I just get worried with the\nMoms and they left his and the activists\nAnd them threatening or if they begin to help people um it just hasn't worried about provoking violence um you know to the point where we don't do anything perch on fire but come stickers in our yard on our cars\nBecause we truly are the silent majority we're not out there showing it I mean I've been to rally but um it just hasn't really scared and worried to still living my day each day\nIt's totally understandable you're you mean you need your your your support for Trump has not wavering but you don't\nYou don't feel safe\nPublicly demonstrating that are showing it was basically right\nCorrect couldn't I don't blame you a bit\nYounger who worry me is if you said you were thinking about dropping support for Trump just meant\nOh no [laughter] no no no I just it it worries me when I'm\nWatching a lot of people are worried about this I'll tell you I think ... I think there are a lot of people like you who just don't want to call attention to themselves 'cause this is an insane group of people and they're showing a willingness to assault and a timid David intact anybody and you're right to think that violence is just around the corner\nAnd who wants to bring that on so your point is that there are a lot of people like you who are going to vote the way Trump would want them to vote for him I ... for Republicans coming up in this election that nobody maybe counting\nYes um you know nobody's got signed in science and a yard sale everybody I talked to is a hundred percent mad guy though Trump and nobody talks about it and it's almost like you know we've with her about it like ... are are you okay with Trump\nOh yes it's out in the old in the old Soviet Union people would go to the bathrooms in their house to whisper to each other what they really thought because they were afraid that the state if the regime was listening to him and so you're\nBasically just driving describing the same thing the difference is that in in twenty six teams there were Trump yard signs everywhere you went in states across this country they're not there now without Trump isn't on the ballot leader so\nYou you might not be all that many Trump signs to be put in yards but but your point is the outward support for Donald Trump is is being suppressed by people to not call the countries themselves right where you're concerned\nAbout violence is shared let it grabs soundbite number nine listen to this ... this is Rand Paul it was on Fox and friends today\n... the air heart or you have a big fear about this rhetoric your fear is that somebody's going to get killed\nSomeone almost did I was there at the ball field when Stevens police almost died\nFrom a very very angry violent man who is inside and really via rhetoric on the left and this hasn't been reported enough when he came onto the field with a semi automatic weapon firing probably close to two hundred shots at us shooting five people in almost ... he was yelling [noise] this is for health care\nHe also had a list of conservative legislators Republicans in his pocket\nBut he was willing to kill so what happens when Democrats said get up in their face they need to realize that there are a lot of unstable people out there there are people with anger issues there are people that are prone to violence there is going to be an assassination if this doesn't ratchet down and I think the other side needs to really calling the rhetoric down\nPretty much what you're saying you're afraid of violence being visited on you and here's Rand Paul fearing that as an assassination is going to say the Democrats are not going to call their people back the Democrats are not going to ask them to calm down I think some Democrats themselves are afraid of these people\n\nBut privately I think the Democrats are encouraging this privately I think the Democratic party wants\nAmerica to think that this in ... on his behavior is\nPretty natural pretty normal that it is representative of of a majority of American people like Democrats want that perception out there they want the anger\nAnd the on his behavior justified on the basis of the trumpet so unacceptable Trump is so bad so dangerous so sick so whatever\nBut there's a lot of reasons they're not going to tamp down there's a lot of reasons they're not going to distance themselves from it and there's a lot of reasons why they're not going to ask these people to back off a little it'd be more responsible\nThey don't think it would help them\nThey think this kind of on the ...
