predict neurologist also a car credit physician ... gates way to health\nAnd today we're talking about Lyme disease what is gates way to health gateway to help we address chronic neurological chronic auto immune chronic pain conditions naturally without drugs\nAnd lime disease falls into what so many people with chronic illness have because a lot of people who have chronic pain chronic fatigue or then diagnosis having Lyme disease so that's why we're talking about today and I should be joined by my friend Kathy Kathy are you there\nYes I Am good morning egg mourning mourning\nSo Kathy any thoughts on Lyme disease before we get rocking and rolling\nWell let's first start with all those symptoms what why would someone look for because like so many times I hear that it's like flu mhm that sort of thing so\nI I I wrote my own notes have weird disease in this day and age we have immunizations for malaria is and things like that and why do I have I think for for line but let's talk about first that the symptoms and what people should look for if they're not feeling well why would they think they had Lyme disease\nIn the acute phase so usually Lyme disease is going to happen in the spring or the summer months most notably that's when people are out hiking\nThat's when the deer tick a is producing as their termed larval ... so it's the small little baby deer ticks that are more likely to spread Lyme disease\nAnd if you're out hiking you may not see that you were bitten by a tick sometimes the ticks crawl into you know little ... like behind your knee and the growing area and you can be bitten the standard out there is that they say you have to have a check on you for twenty four hours\nIt can transmit the wind bacteria ... free\nTo your circulation for you to be infected with Lyme disease now most typically the symptoms that present or about a week to ten days later where somebody starts to have a flu like illness you start to have joint pain they start to just have low energy referred to as ... and\nThey may have the rash now many of you out there who are familiar with Lyme disease have heard of the bulls eye rash\nBut the bulls eye rash only occurs in about forty to Seventy percent of individuals' infected with Lyme disease and so there's this pretty large gap of thirty to sixty percent\nTo Seventy percent of individuals' [noise] infected with Lyme disease and so there's this pretty large gap of thirty to sixty percent who aren't going to have the rash which creates a lot of confusion for patients that actually creates a lot of confusion for patient Dr interactions and we'll get into all that\nKind of Lyme disease is so complicated folks\nBecause there are so many aspects to it and our current society there are two majoring factions within Lyme disease you have your standard infectious disease approach you also have an alternative medicine approach and they are diametrically opposed there about is you know\nSeparate as the opposite ends of the political spectrum in our country at this point in time [laughter] yeah it's very diverse very contentious and I'm going to try to present both sides\nI'm also going to poke holes in both sides because you as the consumer need to be informed about Lyme disease use the patient you is the the grandmother of someone will find disease needs to really understand this condition\nBecause trust me you're going to talk to doctors and everybody has an opinion about it and those opinions you have to know are they based on fact or not and that's what we're going to go into today [noise]\nOkay so if we're going to attack and we need to paint the picture of the standard Lyme disease treatment first out like\nYeah we are says oh it's so let's say you're out hiking you're somewhere out in the mountains where potentially there's a deer tick or you're on the east coast you're walking through a field with tall grass\nAnd let's say you're bitten by a tick let's say you don't see the tech on you know when I said it has to be on there for twenty four hours I'm just telling you what standard infectious disease research papers in textbooks will say\nNow there's a lot of thought out there that you can be infected with Lyme disease even if the ticks on there for a period shorter than twenty four hours but\nYou have the tick bite you get infected you develop the symptoms you go to your doctor and you tell them you know have you know I just feel horrible I don't have an energy my joints hurt it's come on all of a sudden I feel like I have the flu\nAnd then the doctor may say well have you seen a rash you may say yes you may say no now if the doctor does diagnosed with Lyme disease they may run some blood test\nWhich are referred to as an ally is the test as well as then followed by a western blot test they may not they may just put you on antibiotics but the important thing with Lyme disease is that there's a critical period the critical period for antibiotics is basically within the first month or so after you were bitten by a tick\nNow what I hear from patients patient after patient for patient as many of you know listening to us we have a clinic in Reno we have a clinic here in Henderson well\nKathy you're still there correct yes I Am okay and we kind of gave an overview of Lyme disease and we talked about the acute phase we've talked about the bacteria but now let's go deeper I think after you had some item ... dog yeah let's jump into the post treatment Lyme disease syndrome mhm\nYeah so with chronic Lyme where the post treatment Lyme disease syndrome now understand when I say all of this there are these two major factions within Lyme disease that I Would have to in the first Fifteen minutes one it is the standard infectious disease model\nWho largely until recently did not acknowledge this post treatment Lyme disease syndrome or post wine treatment disease and robot however you want to arrange it basically that's just called chronic Lyme disease they didn't even knowledge it said chronic Lyme doesn't exist\nFlat out because these are our infectious disease specialist these are the experts you know that shakes a lot of people who are coming in and say hey I was bitten by a tech I developed this illness maybe my doctor didn't treat me and you know that thirty day window and now it's like my life has room because they have this joint pain I heard everywhere have horrible fatigue on and on and on\nVersus then there's the eye labs group which is referred ... as the lime literate medical doctor so these are people who say no chronic Lyme disease does exist\nIt is a much much bigger problem than we ever thought it would would be in fact they're way more people infected with Lyme disease than we ever thought as well as co infections which are microorganisms like ... ...\nAnd these individuals who are chronically ill need to be on antibiotics for a long long long period of time to eradicate the infection from their body\nSo that the dichotomy so to speak\nFor a long long long period of time to eradicate the infection from their body\nSo that the dichotomy so to speak surrounding this chronic Lyme disease\nComponent and that's where a lot of people who are chronically ill will go to their doctors searching for solutions I've seen thousands of you\nCome in and saying you know nobody can figure out why I'm so sick a lot of you are diagnosed as having fibromyalgia now [laughter] this is where if you have what you think of fiber miles or you may read on line where people will say all five ... Lyme disease which is completely bogus completely incorrect but\nThat is out there being pushed by this line literate medical doctor crowd and I'm not knocking the line with her medical doctors completely and I'm not knocking infectious disease specialist completely but we're going to go into the research on this and really kind of show you that there is a middle ground where researchers are coming to\nBut when it comes to post treatment Lyme disease syndrome there are a definitive things that are wrong in these patients\nAnd researchers are now finding that certain molecules can be tracked in the body of somebody who has persistent symptoms even after they get the antibiotics early on uh one of 'em is called C. C. L. Nineteen that's an immune chemical\nAnd there are other tests coming out relative to this too because a lot of the research is actually coming from Johns Hopkins there's if there's a researcher who I really admire their his name is Dr I caught a U C O T T all of you are interested in Lyme disease go ahead and look him up\nAnd what he has done is he is kind of said okay what's the reality here with this chronic Lyme issue and he went and he basically studied all these patients who have chronic Lyme said you know this is an actual entity there is something here that we need to pay attention to it so that's kind of disorienting post treatment Lyme disease syndrome\nLet me ask you I can remember clear back into the eighties where I had a friend who said that she had chronic fatigue right and she said well they're not sure what brought it on their thinking maybe Lyme disease on the ... the connection just stayed in the auto immune they now that\nYeah and that's where you know chronic fatigue is another one of those where everybody will say oh all chronic fatigue is Lyme disease there is an autoimmune component to a lot of chronic fatigue patients I've seen it there is also huge stress component that a lot of people don't talk about what chronic fatigue\nSo chronic fatigue is very very multi factorial which is why a lot of chronic fatigue patient's also get blown off by their medical doctors because there's not one definitive blood tests at this point in time or treatment pharmaceutical for chronic fatigue so all these conditions that kind of happened nebulous umbrella of symptoms\nKind of get pushed into this arena where patients get incredibly confused about what they actually have about what is actually wrong and that's why I'm the gates way to health radio show we talk about these topics\nBecause there are a definitive things that are wrong with a chronic fatigue patient their definitive things that are different that are wrong with a fiber mouser patient and there are things that are wrong and basically testable and the patient who has chronic Lyme disease so we should be able to differentiate all these\nDifferent factions within the chronic pain arena\nWell then how does the post treatment line to the Senate gum has that been used by the alternative community as an exclamation for chronic illness\n[noise] so [noise] in a lot of it is based on it's just you know folks a lot of this is based on very poor test for this issue um will go into the standard infectious\nIt's on it's just you know folks a lot of this is based on very poor test for this issue um will go into the standard infectious disease testing and how it's really not\nAccurate for Lyme disease and then now that we are going to talk about the line with her at world the highlights world we have to understand their testing so let's say let's\nSay your joints hurt let's say you're fatigued let's say you have brain fog you go and you see your general practitioner jump practice runs a bunch of test they test your thyroid they test you for rheumatoid arthritis they test you for lupus\nAnd you don't have it so they say we don't know what's wrong with you why don't you take this anti depressant I think you're fatigue because you're depressed at which point internally the patient says no I'm not surprised I'm just sick and you know it's very offensive to a lot of people\nSo then you start searching online especially in the era of the Internet like we have now you start searching online and you go on Facebook and you go in different support groups where people are saying\nAll illnesses like fibromyalgia or lime disease so now you start saying oh well maybe I should see a lime literate doctor so now you go over to the line literate medical doctors clinic\nAnd you say okay well I think I may have Lyme disease and they say you know I think you do too\nSo they run this test it's the most common one out there is called the ... test\nAnd they run the ... test which has a huge false positive rate huge huge\nAnd so now you come back and keep in mind the identical test has a different criteria\nFor interpreting if Lyme disease then the standard Centers for Disease Control and prevention criteria and basically they'll say well you're CDC negative but your eye Gen x positive or your eye Gen x in determinant we think you have Lyme disease\nNow the problem folks I have with this\nAnd don't have a problem and differences and diagnostic interpretation but the implications of a positive test for Lyme disease in the line literate medical doctor office\nIs pretty profound because a lot of you then are going to be sold on you had Lyme disease you need to take years of antibiotics years of IV antibiotics\nNow I'm not saying that there are patients out there who have benefited from this because some I've I've seen them where they go on to get antibiotics and they do feel better but I've seen scores of patients who come out of these treatment facilities\nFrankly medically bankrupt because the treatments are so expensive I mean I've had several patients who spent over a million dollars in ivy antibiotic treatments with language or medical doctors\nSome could afford it others couldn't and I hope that you get that point most of you listening out there\nSo now if we kind of look at it from the side so you have a patient who hasn't undefined a bull illness\nGoes and has a task that has a huge false positive rate\nBasically in their mind to have Lyme disease at this point now they have to take all these antibiotics\nThey become financially ruined him frankly their physiology gets ruined by the antibiotics and these are the people I see and it is a problem and we need to talk about it and I even was digging up research articles on this now too and it's actually getting to be kind of contentious because the standard infectious disease doctors are like\nYou know from a from a Health Organization standpoint we kind of need to blow the whistle on this\nNow I'm not completely anti going literate doctors but I Am\nA little concerned based on the current information that this is still being done because we're finding that Lyme disease is actually turning into an auto immune problem and immune deficiency problem and and my experience I Will say addressing\nTurning into an auto immune problem and immune deficiency problem\nAnd in my experience I Will say addressing it when it's in this chronic form lots of times without\nAll these antibiotics I've had tremendous success so this is a discussion I'm not saying I have the end all be all answer for this but researchers need to start discussing this and say hey this isn't on me from we need to start looking at this differently different management strategies that may not ruin someone's intestines because her own six years of ID antibiotics\nAnd you know what could we do maybe in lieu of that so that was my diatribe Kathy\n[laughter] have any idea percentage wise how many people benefit from all those anti banning let's let him best right in that sort of thing ... percent ten percent yeah\nAnd the spending thousands and thousands and apt to millions of dollars and when you're saying that are you telling me that insurance doesn't\nAnd he tested these individuals in thirty nine percent of these people who have a tick bite who have a rash who have all the signs and symptoms of Lyme disease come from by their general practitioner thirty nine percent did not test positive based on the CDC criteria\nSigns and symptoms of Lyme disease confirmed by their general practitioner thirty nine percent did not test positive based on the CDC criteria now that's a huge problem because now are taking people who have Lyme disease and we're getting alarming rates of false negative test results\nSo I talked about the line literate crowd we have false positives on this side we have false negative so people who actually have Lyme disease or not being identified as having Lyme disease who were then told that they are crazy were then told that they're depressed were then told that they're making up their symptoms now that's an equally as bad issue in my opinion\nSo so that that side of it any thoughts on that county\n[noise] uh yeah and I keep all you know me I'm visualizing nests in my head and I'm visualizing and it all the stuff that I hear\nFrom you and your patients that I mean you've mentioned fiber mild here today we've talked about the at chronic fatigue\nAnd now we're talking Lyme disease and how they whichever side you're looking at that kind of get bad it back and forth and kind of lumped together and again I think maybe this ties into what you and I were talking about that research coming at a UC Davis red guy oh yeah ... yeah\nYou brought that up yes so fantastic so how is it that thirty nine percent of people who actually have Lyme disease test as not having Lyme disease\nAnd this is where they did some nominal research at UC Davis one of the main authors his name was bombed guards or her name was ... the author's name is ... and this doctor bomb guards went in and they studied what the line bacteria does to our body and they realized\nThe Lyme bacteria actually destroys parts of our lymph nodes are lymph nodes are we we create our or military so to speak to combat infections and they found that the type of\nImmune cells produce from lymph nodes that are basically destroyed by the line bacteria are the ones were casting for what the standard Lyme disease treatment I e antibody so basically your body's ability to make antibodies against Lyme disease is completely impaired because the flying bacteria does a Trojan Horse\nType of deal into her lymph node goes in and are basically destroys\nThe part of your body that's trying to protect you\nThis is why people actually in animals can be infected with Lyme disease multiple times most of us know if you're getting infection well yeah it sucks but you should have immunity to that infection for the rest of your life\nWell that's not the case with Lyme disease and so they went and they discovered why this is and then from that now we can actually understand oh okay so we get you get infected by the bacteria it goes and it destroys the German all centers\nAnd you're ... so you can't mount an antibody response oh yeah and we're testing for Lyme disease by doing antibody test you know wonder about forty percent of you are labeled as being false negative\nSlam dunk that's a pretty big important issue for most of you out there so that's really important to ... oh yeah and if you're going and you're seeing the line with her medical doctor you're getting high Jenike stuffed in what type of testing does a lot of that surround it Santa body testing so we need a new testing model\nFor Lyme disease and I've talked to a sell your microbial researchers on this infectious disease research is is the best way to say I've talked to them about these issues and they're actually worse than other immune tests that were developed for Lyme disease but they are actually bought\nTo my knowledge I Can't confirm this can't can phrase framed blocked no but they were actually bought by the current testing regimen out there so the prevailing testing model of the allies in the western blot is still out there\nTesting regimen out there so the prevailing testing model of the allies in the western blot is still out there and it's still going to be pushed\nBut hopefully is more doctors like myself can talk about this out there and get this information out there we can have you know an awakening\nHim through this awakening more people will demand better testing in my opinion you're in New testing procedures are being pushed as well but I in my opinion something like to see CEO Nineteen molecule discovered by Dr caught\nWill become one of the the hallmarks of Lyme disease testing because frankly folks opposed treatment Lyme disease syndrome or this chronic Lyme\nCondition Israel Israel because a lot of you were told you don't have wind disease or your misdiagnosis not having [noise] so we need a test for it by the same token a lot of you don't have Lyme disease and you think you mind disease in your being sold a bill of goods\nThat can be really expensive to your pocketbook and your health\nSo\nWhat else did you have Cathy I think we have about a minute\nTo well I think in this method is a good point [laughter] place for me to point out to the folks that if they haven't put enough of that together today to figure out that you don't listen to the norm right that you're asserting dig under under the pile of blankets or whatever they're putting it under a to find the alternative that will get\nBring people some belief and that's that's the case is your take on the people who've been to like you said the lady who was bankrupt medically right and ended up with anxiety once you see or that your whole practice is based on getting to the root cause of the condition\nAnd once you find that cause than treating that to get them back to health\nCompletely completely yep we want to call it what it is we want to identify what the issue is we want to be real with you about what it is\nAnd we don't want a mascot with prescription that um after a bunch of stuff that's going to cause more

more money was the man on a mission to retire one version bumps keys\nAbout Goodell wildly radio show today we're trying to cover the sad sad story of why the common person out there or can't get ahead in life and what we're perceptions about the world and weaknesses they have the human beings to keep them from coming successful\nWere doing case study on an email the gentleman sent me about how from his early life he's changed his\nHis skill set over and over and over again to try to stay ahead of ah\nOf societies which were protected logical advancements\nAnd he has not been able to keep up I'm going to pick it back up where he says he just became a programmer and he says since there was a lot of demand for programmers background I was making a lot of money and figured I finally found the courage to rely on those stop right there for a second I was making a lot of money where it's all that money\nWhy does Neal five ten Fifteen houses wandering the on the part of a complex where's all the money\nSee this was the thing no matter what you do you think you're going to get ahead because you have a good job better job with the best job or an incredible job it's still a job and you earn and you spend in you earn and you spend your earning you're spending your not building any wealth\nYou're not getting anywhere in society and yet you think the world is wrong because they choose you up and spit you out\nThat's because technology will always change if you were a guy that made saddles two hundred years ago you probably had a pretty good business or really a pretty good job\nConstantly you either have to change with it\nOr you have to get out of line of change I'm an advocate you through this show today that you can do one or the other you can either change with it or you can step out advocate away from it by just becoming financially free and not have to worry about where society goes both of those items work\nSo it goes on and says that was a total social media became popular and now people can share their ideas on line without needing a programmer or hire a cheap one which I predict would happen some day in the future so I got out of this business so he ran again again it wasn't a business it was a job\nI change jobs again I'm a something for nothing instantaneously gravitationally diseased\nGuy that likes to hop from job to job to job or basically type a personality to not be so brutal does you know what uh type a personality is it somebody who will throw mud on the wall and hope something sticks he changes his mind or her mind\nOver and over and over again they start a thousand projects finished none of them right these are the typical Taipei People\nThat are up there just always looking for a way to make a fast buck there's no investment in the future in this type of mentality none what has he done to invest in the future and why should eat deserve do not have to work hard for the rest of his life he's done nothing to change that outlook\nGoes on and says I figure I Need to have the skill where I Do not have to compete with the whole world that is high demand\nTo think about that shape I now figure I Need a skill that I don't have to compete\nWhile\nIs that not complete and total giving up I mean that's just I give up I needed skilled is so low\nThat no human being would want it there's no competition for this job right and so because there's no competition for the job to job is so terrible that I'll be saving right so\nWhat did you do then became a truck driver which I'm currently doing and love it except now I hear about how they're making driverless cars and semis which I'm sure we'll workplace our job one day\nYeah one day they will and when they do you'll still be broke you'll see still be looking for another job\nAnd you know until they make guys that clean toilets there's going to be a lot of janitorial jobs around maybe they'll make a robotic limbs to Sunday then you lose that job too but what have you done to invest in the future and by the way why does he like driving a truck I've driven trucks before masses solitude no competition\nNo argumentation nobody to deal with\nYou just sit there by yourself in total solitude don't have to interact with the world boy nice job great job do you make any money you know we have a future know what happens when you can't drive anymore yes you'll be out of work and broke\nIt goes on and says here's the reason for this email I hear you on the radio recently stating that you are expanding nationwide and opening up new officers and other states that's a good thing for your business since you're already successful and say that you have more money than you will ever need\nI just wonder if you grow so large and add thousands of do preferred members that your second deal that the second a deal comes available it will be gone within two seconds due to so many people doing going after it\nWell my friend that's already true good deals don't last when there was an opportunity to make a hundred percent return it doesn't matter if we had ten people\nWell my friend that's already true good deals don't last when there was an opportunity to make a hundred percent return it doesn't matter if we had ten people or ten thousand people the deals are going to be sucked up right\nBut the reality is that what you're talking about is you're talking about the abundance mentality or lack there up you believe in the zero sum game reality of the world you believe for me to have a dollar I have to take it from you for you to have a dollar you have to take it from somebody else\nIs that there's not enough dollars to go round the simply isn't true\nAnd I must cover it after I finished your paragraph you're assist or worse a multibillion dollar company will see what you are doing and duplicate your business models that millions of advertising worldwide to point to the point where no houses or apartments will be available as investments since they will be bought before you can even see it\nI'll let me tell you a little secret about what's going to duplicate this business because lifestyles does something that no corporate America company could ever duplicate it gives back it has the abundance mentality and believes it doesn't have to have all of the business\nIt believes it can give it away to its customers lettuce customers become rich instead of it becoming rich in other words I could have been a Donald Trump I could have said I Want to own all of us real so I could talk people investing in me I get old billions and billions of dollars of apartment complexes\nWith all the members I have but I was not interested in me being a billionaire I was interested in my members becoming millionaires and so instead of me taking all the millions and adding up to billions\nWe taught people's go out and earn the millions and we help them do that\nNo corporation in America can be founded on that kind of generosity it's impossible no company could ever survived that business model except my why because I've already rich before I started in ... I'm not greedy and you just won't find that many people that are that way right\nMost people go to work because they want to make money that you you go to work every day because you want to make money\nI go to work every day because I Want to help people and I don't go to work every day that's the beauty of it I own a business that is out there I go to work on the radio one hour a day I go to work\nA once a month or two a two day just so I stay involved in my members and know that the message is still tight ...\nSo you take another corporation is going to allow somebody to do that I don't think so and so your premises wrong from there but it's even more wrong in another way which I'm going to cover when we come back from this next break because that lack mentality lack mentality that you're carrying\nThat as a product that's pretty hard to outdated self because think about it for just a second where did they get in that way for us to vaporize ourselves to go to bed at night and sleep we have to have a place to lay our head down at night to eat our dinners et cetera et cetera so until they have vaporize Asian\nWe have housing now with the vapors Asian guess what I'm going to invest in vapors Asian\nRight but until then\nHousing has been around forever and probably will be around for a lot longer okay so here it is the guy saying do you could steal all the deals no I couldn't do all the deals because if I didn't have a group of like minded people we wouldn't have enough money to go out and do all the deals\nNow the next point he's making is once we teach all these people all over the world how to do this there is not going to be enough deals\nNow here's a re out\nI've been doing this in Houston, Texas for Thirty years and we're still doing deals at a higher rate than we've ever done a map before so that part is why\nWe went to Dallas we've been doing it there for Fifteen Years still doing deals at a faster rate than ever before San Antonio Austin the same thing\nWould you have to understand is for twenty six years in Houston I've had lifestyles we still haven't even touched the market we put a dent in the microwave scratched the edge of the market\nBecause there's so many apartment complexes there's like three thousand apartment complexes in years to three thousand dollars three thousand San Antonio and Austin and that's only just taxes\nThat's not counting middling not counting the nine we own down in Corpus Christi et cetera et cetera tips so here's the point when we expand to a new area like Atlanta where we're going\nThat whole city has Thirty Years' worth prospect of action for us we haven't even begun it just like when they told us when we were high school when I was in high school the stupid idiots told us there was Twenty years of oil left\nTwenty years and that's it will be out of oil\nThat's the lack mentality now there's a hundred years of oil\nTwenty years and that's it will be out of oil\nThat's the lack mentality now there's a hundred years of oil left in each of about five countries out there right in Egypt falcon fact there's probably a hundred years while in two or three states in this country just one state and yet\nWe still believe we have an oil now we believe that there's so many apartment complexes that if we signed up as many people's rehab in taxes in every other state union they're still being a business from to do that and that will be Ken lifetimes before that happens\nBut my point is is with all of that said where they're being true to disguise totally miss the mark with his email my point you is how sad is it for him\nBecause here is now thirty six years of age\nAnd here's what he believes it seems like the only secure jobs for those who are not already rich are the ones that take many years of sacrifice and credentials such as being a doctor or lawyer which is something that everyone is willing to do that is the demand\nWill always be high there it is the only thing you can get rich doing as being a doctor or lawyer a thing that which\nMost of us are not willing to do or he just nailed it for himself didn't ... hey\nI'm happy that I'm not rich I'm unhappy that I haven't been successful my whole life but I'm not\nWilling to either go do something you would put me in the position that couldn't be copied or number to stick with anything and get better at it like I should have got better at electronics I should have got better at programming but I didn't I didn't I didn't I just kept running and now I'm a truck driver\nHe goes on and said I just wanted to see if you could perhaps way my negative way of thinking about this sense it's a very since it seems that every money making opportunity will eventually go way of the buggy whip they could buy\nEvery money making opportunities he spoke of\nWas about work it was about labor\nIt was about doing something to somebody else doesn't want to do and it's that belief system which is killing them think about\nIt if you would have started investing when he was Twenty years old and real estate doll houses that I bought twenty six years ago are still there people are still living in them I don't know because I'm like this guy I progressed in my knowledge of my business\nSo I went from houses duplex is the four Plex his small apartments to medium sized departments to large apartment\nI progress my skills that knowledge base right now I'm trying to do class apartments I'm pushing myself to progress my skill set because I Know that the old stuff will eventually be old too old to using the new stuff I'll have to understand [noise] so I have to be on the cutting edge that's what a class of ... got to be in the cutting edge of the business\nBut this gentleman doesn't want to be on the cutting edge he doesn't want to do anything he wants to go backwards\nHe wants to trade time for money secondly he has no assets the businesses will have assets\nAs inflation occurs our assets go up in value as income goes up rents go up the acid value goes up\nWe keep growing he keeps having to pay more money his job income gets watered down by inflation our asset values get increased by inflation\nJob your income gets watered down by inflation or asset values get increased by inflation my friends this gentleman's life\nHas been lived behind the prism\nOf the negativity of failure or we don't know if there's any possibility that you can never be saved if he's asked for help and I took through the mail today live this morning and I'm given to back alive today I Hope he's listening to a short

[laughter] you down and made out of these laughing I made them laugh so I wanted to do All right [laughter] what else what else are you on that line of Wells Fargo\nBorders arisen Asians tumble amid rising interest rates well this is a [laughter] it's right at home John right yeah and uh last time I checked Wells Fargo I'm pretty sure they lead them nation and mortars origin nations right\nUh because of interest rates rising pretty much has evaporated or most of the refinances out there right correct um which is has done for our team\nStill we get back couple few months so I\nBet you where are our numbers are probably similar I mean there's probably eighty percent originated\nIn an era goes there down twenty two percent feels like we're down about twenty two percent you know I I mean we're we're not Wells Fargo are dart team [laughter] about\nPercent feels like we're down about twenty two percent you know I I mean we're we're not Wells Fargo are dart team [laughter]\nWhat about what we're down right it's and it's because the low hanging fruit to gun yeah right the ... have only a lower interest rate\nWhen he gets out of mortgage insurance well there are still opportunities or get out a mortgage insurance but when you're rate goes up to ... percent or one on one and a half percent says makes it gets rid of the benefit for you right actually so they're a\nCease fire the originator forty six billion in mortgage is the third quarter which is down twenty two percent from last year's total fifty nine billion so [noise] um it is called market compression is real or if your mortgage originator you feel it I Know you know\nUh it's going to continue I think we're in about the third inning of this\nThe bottom line is it just a ... you know listen houses are still selling it\nI think it was even higher than that it was ridiculous so you know the bottom line is it just a ... you know listen houses are still selling if they're priced right in there under three fifty like that right and and especially in desirable neighborhoods like ... and even you know gosh\nSummer or winter or green valley something four hundred below that that bad boys going and about a day yeah it really is you know the problem is you know three hundred thousand that's a that's a half the number so affordability uh like I say every single show\nIs becoming an issue when you couple that with higher interest rates\nPeople were getting priced out of this market however we've done the show's before where we've shown other states\nOr cities meeting in sales price which is a lot higher than ours yup although their median income levels are about the same interest a little bit higher right\nNot as much as you think yeah I I agree with you know\nSo we are skies not falling they're still ... you know we're not at DEF CON five for affordability um but we we are ... is becoming an issue John ah if I have\nIt so you have to suffer September we sold a we saw Don homes condos in town homes um three thousand and five right right compared to a year ago September sales were down sixteen points four percent for homes down Thirteen point four percent pecan doesn't down on it now because we didn't have enough to sell\nClark County has an affordability score of eighty four compared to Ninety two for the entire nation a score below a hundred indicates that the median home prices are less affordable in the historic average Clark County score has been and below a hundred\nAnd uh has has been below a hundred in the lower than the country since the third quarter of two thousand seven teams so we are climbing into an affordability issue now we did a little a researcher research you know you're caught who we put some numbers together for you\nWhich I thought was interesting because if you bought a house back into thousands well John right when when the median skills prices one Eighteen okay if you bought a house of one Eighteen\nMy rates are like three and a quarter back then [laughter] right so if if you buy like F. ha right you know what your payment would have been seven hundred bucks a month seven hundred all in all and very conventional twenty percent down five thirty five a month taxes and insurance that's that's that's the\nTake that times four and that's my car payment [laughter] times five and I never know [laughter] yeah\nOkay so ah two thousand Eighteen a three hundred thousand he's the now the sales price the meeting sales price so if you want an F ha loan three and a half percent down mhm guy Nineteen sixty a month\nCompared to ... seven hundred a month John okay what little difference Beck conventional twenty percent down Fifteen hundred bucks a month for some bad right cause and that's that's taking into effect these higher interest rate mhm wild right\nNow it's forecast what's going to happen and why we're telling you this is okay you miss the boat and two thousand twelve right but ... you're renting an apartment right\nExactly it's like you've talked today a to somebody that makes Seventy grand a year still renting right and they're frustrated they're frustrated if they wait two more years my guess is that we could be hidden three fifty right now who knows right\nBut that's a that's a realistic median sales price the way we're going right now I mean I agree we years who knows\nOkay and I'll be I'll tell you what race\nIn sales price the way we're going right now I I agree ... years who knows\nOkay and I'll be I'll tell you what rates are going to be a\nBull [laughter] five percent anymore no are probably going to be in the Sixers maybe the sevens will give her the benefit of the doubt we'll just see six and a quarter guy well they say might not even be an option 'cause that's so prices too high and was Clark County while we're talking about oh yeah I'm hoping they raise it right actually I don't even have a payment for that so\nSo you'd have to go conventional three percent down right instead of F. A. J. yup well that's a shame payment now is Nineteen sixty seven if you wait we go up that high\nRates continue to climb there'll be paying twenty five fifty a month All right yeah so basically you know that same type of product\nSo that's about six hundred bucks last time I checked the math on that it's a lot of hot\nA conventional with twenty percent down right now Fifteen hundred a month you know and it goes up to if you keep on waiting twenty two hundred\nPretty close to Twenty one twenty five yeah you know so the bottom line is like anything in life right that stock you know when I told you six years ago I wanted to go buy a bunch of apple sauce and I didn't do it yeah yeah the real smart right\nBut I tell all your money they would if I did it a couple of years later I still be sitting on a lot of money John yep but I still didn't do it right or be with them by ... two years later I still be sitting on a lot of money but I still didn't do it right here in Dallas is the bottom line the raw says something like that anyway\nThe bottom line you have to own ... listen if you're renting at some point ... if you keep running you're gonna keep paying their rent and it's going to keep going up by something like the kinds I talked to this morning\nThey are going to buy what they can afford right whether it's a townhouse whether it's a Fifteen hundred square foot single family probably they're going to buy something no matter what it is because they're tired of paying rent and they're tired of the landlord knocking on the door and saying hey you're signing a new lease and when it's going up on an hour's\nHey you're getting kicked out 'cause I'm Selma how exactly right yes or [laughter] you know like anything I mean I've been renting sucks it now you're cool\nYou know people we talk to people all the time that ... that I mean look the lady that we send a ... maybe it wasn't as her that I sent the pre approval letter out today that spy Macondo huh ... who is the print the principal Shia decent credit score right makes a hundred grand a year Stacey yeah\n[laughter] yeah ... pretty much no debt and she was worried she was a qualified [laughter] go listen if\nIf I had everybody was worried qualify we're like you I my my life would be a lot easier you know is that\nWhy don't you wait so long inch and she's like I don't I just\nDidn't think I was going to ... you know I I mean I meet people like that every now and then I also meet people with you know four eighty credit scores with no money in a bank and you know a fresh out of a bankruptcy while they're also hard to pay rent and however they don't qualify as so but you don't know unless you call right and here's how you find out five\nSeven seven two six zero zero seven oh two five seven seven twenty six hundred that's how you reach those in the office you want to reach us in the studio we're going to cut to a break ... theory about it\n[laughter] that's a seven to first first show with being ... where he lived down I ... when you fill me fill me there you go that's all hip hop is like that now is that your film is still around right ... we still go with that right he fills five seven seven
