party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nParty promoting this this political party ought to be no where near winning any thing\nIn the next elections\nThere is not a single reason to vote for these people under any real breakup commonsense\n\nTake a look at the things they advocate take a look at the people they try to destroy take a look at the things they are promoting\nIt defies common sense to support this\nAnd frankly I don't think they have as much support as the media narratives would indicate I don't want somebody to say right now I don't believe\nAnd I haven't believe for a long time that there has been a slam dunk blue wave what we're being told right now is that six months ago nine months ago all the way back to December when the first generic ballots were taken a generic polls\nThat the Democrats had a twelve to ... gene point advantage that the American people will realize their mistake electing Trump with the Republicans I couldn't wait\nTo put Democrats back in power now that argued against real life real life since two thousand ten is the Democrats have been losing elections left and right but for some reason the two thousand six in midterms the American\nPeople were all of a sudden going to admit all these mistakes they made and put Democrats back in power I don't\nBelieve it but we got media narratives that a gigantic blue wave was going to happen and we had that media narrative\nGo on from December last year all the way through\nSeptember of this year and then and then the generic ballot started tightening and then it began to look\nMaybe it won't be as big a blue\nWave\nAnd Republicans look like they might actually gain seats in the Senate and oh no now the president's approval numbers is higher than it's ever been CNN's on poll forty four percent\nRasmussen has trumpet fifty one\nThere is nothing happening that suggests say blue wave is happening I frankly don't believe there ever was one I think as we get closer to the moment of truth I eat election day\nPeople have to start reeling in these mad and cat for addictions and projections because they want to get as close to accurate as they can for the sake of their business\nThere in the polling business they don't want to be wildly wrong again and again and again after all of that's the case who would hire them\nSo\nNow we're told well there's been a shift a little bit and it may be I'm starting to see stories here five ways that Republicans can hold the house seven ways the Republicans can hold the house foreign ways they could lose the house with a month ago there was no way the Republicans are going to hold out\nNow all of a sudden we're starting to see it as a blue wave may not I don't think they ever did I don't think he ever did exist I think it made up manufactured\nYou'll get to pull result you want depending on when you take the fall and who you decide to put in your sample\nThere is no way\nThere is simply no way that a political party openly promoting this invasion of seven thousand now eight thousand illegal American people are not angry that we have not\n\nStopped this the American people in mass are not wanting more illegal immigration\nThe American people in a majority no matter how you slice it\nAnd let everybody who wants to him in the American people are not there at the American people never been there the Democratic party is there and the Democratic party wants you to think a lot of Americans are there but they aren't\nGoing through your own poll wherever you hang around do you think we ought to basically eliminate the border let anybody wants to come in and I can guarantee you less than ten percent of the people are going to say yes and yet they can look at a drive by news media every day and you would get the impression is a lot of Americans that a lot of people to support this idea\nOf these are so poor people there there's the hungry we we we have so much they have so little [laughter] we mark what the that's not\nA position it's going to win elections if it were or we would have had amnesty back in two thousand two\n\nIf that was the position of a majority of the American people Donald Trump never gotten the Republican nomination if the\nPeople of this country wanted mobs of seven thousand or eight thousand to be admitted into the country no questions asked to be granted asylum Trump want to never gotten the nomination he certainly would not have been elected president so you tell me what's changed in two years to make the American people think we'd go up\nYou know what Trump was wrong we don't need a wall this proves we just need to let these people in that's the way to stop the chaos they want and let them yet and we should feed them we should house than they have nothing to report are coming from ... countries left them that's not a majority opinion of the United states\nThe ... is going to try to make people who think that way I look like they're mean spirited cold hearted heartless and all this but it's not the case\nThat's not an accurate description of the American people so I\nNone of this to me makes any common sense whatsoever that Trump is in trouble because he wants to build a wall that he's in trouble and the Republicans are because they want to secure the border\nAnd yet the media reliably very suddenly at this point sympathizing with the people on the quote unquote caravan\nTrying to find a way to make Trump look like the bad guy here\nAnd that's just not where the American people are one other thing

people to get Trump doesn't charging but again and he's got bigger charge people could probably make money off this they're clearly picking back piggy backing off Trump's doing and they want to get in

like all these attacks on the turtle and his wife and Ted Cruz and all these other Republicans that have been forced out like just in Nielsen it just reeks of copycat\nTo me\nIt just reek like Bill
