I mean that was kind of considered their job was to reproduce and you know produce the family so if you if a female didn't then it was that big rare thing\nAnd I'm whispered about because you didn't want to make her feel bad right right okay and\nStill today we don't want to make her feel bad but there are a lot more stressors and things like you were talking about\nNot conceding and a lot of health issues that exist today but didn't exist back then\nExactly and there are reasons for that in our society we talked about this across a wide array a broadcast we talk about diabetes we talk about weight gain we talk about the American food supply in essence folks one third of the population is overweight one third of the population is obese\nTen percent of the population is diabetic one third of the population is pre diabetic what that means to you is that we have a problem of gaining excessive weight in this country and we're becoming insulin no Jenike\nInsulin is a hormone in her body many of you are familiar with it because it's tied with diabetes [noise] woods principal function is to bring glucose into the cells of our body but because of the American lifestyle and this is seen in other countries around the world\nWe're becoming more sedentary were eating more carbohydrates reading more saturated fats\nWhat's happening is that we're gaining more and more weight because we're becoming more likely to produce excessive insulin\nSo now if you're the ... suffer out there and you're on a thousand calorie a day diet and you can't lose weight and you feel like being in your head into the wall\nYou need to understand that things have changed in your physiology that are not allowing you to lose weight your body has been programmed to be insulin resistant your body as program not to let the weight go and because of that the hormones remained arranged testosterone means hide the excessive hair growth continues\nYou know maybe bad body odor continues the menstrual regularity continue\nAnd as a consequence lots of times the show us patients don't feel that there's a way out\nSo that's kind of the explanation of why peace us is becoming so much more common but this is such an important topic and you know I really want to drive this point home to men\nBecause lots of times with us we're talking about couples\nAnd we're talking about in this situation a female who's not able to conceive and Cathy's mentioning how you know emotionally traumatizing this can be too and as a male who's a in a supportive role for that female whether your husband and your brother your father your uncle\nYou need to really understand this condition and the implications of it\nUm so I went through puberty at a pretty young age I mean I think it was like ten when my period started that and I remember I was having a horrible body odor at like seven years old\nWhere that would that have been a sign of at that young\nYes absolutely because probably there was some level of genetic programming for the adrenal glands to make excessive da da ... and two later which do you achieve or those you don't know what that is it turns into testosterone and some females are programmed to make too much testosterone from there during the ...\nThat's been eating I didn't know that the symptoms of it it says so young yeah that\nYeah basically so I you know I was on the pill birth control pill to regulate my periods round ten years old\nOn mhm and and they had at Jeremiah Wright that dream is an end dimitrius to flavor it out at sixteen okay and it ended up which\nEver regulated my period and three ring circus of doctors never head and that was\nGoing gluten free on my own in my late twenties that regulated my cycles for the first time in my life\nUh-huh and then and\nAnd then it was you know some years later when I may be going through all that dietary changes supplementation you know just overall lifestyle overhaul is reducing strapped in information which has now brought me to a point as pain free period\nBeautiful beautiful yeah so excited [laughter] I don't even hot yeah anymore which is pretty\n[laughter] believable\nBecause most women have a hotbed no matter whether for once a month need one [laughter] yeah\nThey don't any more than I I Know as a child they actually bring my cells if my hot pad to make cramped so intent but wow that it's been pretty remarkable\nAnd were those of you who don't know their stuff and he is in my opinion she's in many ways a guru now for this type of lifestyle change she is the model of it and you know she's always actively research into seeing new stuff out there I have tremendous respect for\nWhat she's coming up with them what she's seen and you've been so instrumental Stephanie in my career and seeing the practicality of changing one's diet and making it doable you make it do for a lot of other people to do kind of want to go into that a little bit\nTo me it was just um\nOh you're a patient should know that just not seen is worth giving up feeling good and you know for me I it's a very young child like there was always something going wrong so it was you know once they met you and I finally new\nWet feeling good could feel like there was nothing in the world that I Would allow that to come in between me and my body anymore mhm [noise] and um I I Love to cook I Love feeding people and it just all of it became such as\nLike a creative challenge mhm but also the Seventeen\nI didn't want to feel indentured too I wanted to feeling good is empowered me and I wanted it to empower me and all aspects of my life and um and that was just you know for me in our home that is\nHaving a positive attitude and not looking back not being focused on the rearview mirror of what we used to eat or what we used to do but it was [laughter]\nPlowing forward and we feel good and we eat this way now and and and that's it the the plowing forward God she said that healthy state so you're in a position where you don't need to look back anymore\nExactly yeah exactly so it's um and I think you know like like any new habit it just takes a little bit of time of getting used to and you know once you learn how to work with your new ingredient or to say you know\nThis is just too stressful I'm going to opt out and you know when you get in the rhythm of having your lifestyle modified it just becomes the new new ... and your bart continually raises you know I look at\nMy lifestyle now versus when I Lived in treatment with you and it's just ... Bari continued to raise for our our whole home in our children included that's\nWhen you feel good you kinda get greedy within\n[laughter]\nCall me a couple of years ago it's like I wanted to steal a hundred and Fifteen Percent all the time [laughter]\nOr one of those areas that\nIt's hard to go back right [laughter] yeah I don't I never I never ever even when it's eighty proof that and I'm only okay it's like not feeling well if I'm sick and\nUm I really actually pretty much it see that you know it unless we're we have some sort of illness and how we all feel really optimal\nThe majority of the time and that it's taken works but it's just it's all it's all been so worried that\nIn your mind that are really trying to learn the model of success for someone who has a condition with those because so many individuals and stuff and I've talked about this before [noise]\nAltered they'll change their diet and maybe they do feel better but then there's so many factors coming against them from spouses you may not be supportive to family functions to you know grandma's lasagna all these things are playing on people not allowing them to be successful when you say Seventy were you've just been so steadfast\nAnd what you experience now you almost refer to some of these foods is like being poison correct\nThey are [laughter] [laughter] yeah\nOur our kids will you know we'll joke about that um my daughter will say you know oh you don't want to talk just a little bit of gasoline\nJust try to [laughter] people you know in these free\nHe's very diet just that like you can't just habit by and I think um it's all in your mind that you know if you change the diet but your\nFocus on oh this is hard work or oh I Can't have this or that then you're you're putting up road blocks and\nIt just seems silly and inflammatory to get in your own way right on your own health journey and I think you have to not put so much value and\nNot breaking the bread with\nOther is much easier said than done and I think when you you just continually feed\nYour mind could thought about\nThis is working I feel great I'm only it's only going to get better from here I think all of that add up to an entire lifestyle change I think some patients focus on the one struggle or\nHow difficult it would be to have a spouse that wasn't supportive that would be tremendously difficult you know to feel like you have to cook two separate meals every night or\nAnd that's the point I wanted to hammer home because your husband is so supportive and show right there with you\nReally have any individuals as officers and dots or today's broadcasts is as important for the husbands as I said earlier the fathers you know the ... all the meals support system needs to be helping an individual to show us ...\nYeah yeah yeah and I think if I'm In or just how we did it in our home like I was the first one to go gluten free and um\nAnd then it was like I just started doing gluten free and like if you know it's harder piper went into how gluten at that point they did ... and um for me it was just a lot of it was just I mean these changes and for the most part\nMost people don't really know they're eating green free when they're in our home I don't think it\nIsn't it [laughter] right [laughter] you know Dr heard in the face [laughter] not aware of it and the stuff tastes just as good if not better ... than what they're used to exactly\nAnd it's neat because a lot of times we had some friends that this summer and I know after just eating at her home for the one week we've really inspired them they've totally overhauled\nHow they've and eating and they feel so much better as as a family and um it it's easy to just get into the groove of it\nAnd I was discussing this with my husband last night and he said you know so many people have a hard time going with the dietary changes in staying with it and they just give up he said what what does it take do they have to be just in that much pain feel that bad before they can finally commit\nAnd I think a lot of times they don't see that changed like you did stuff and have the thing is to come along and say okay here on that a hundred and Fifteen Percent I don't want to go back to sixty Seventy or eighty percent anymore I Want to feel like this all the time\nRight so\nI Wonder with both the patient you know I think when you get you get used to feeling bad I mean I I really I that resonates with me is just feeling bad and you're on auto pilot pilot it's like a\nOkay so that's where in the last ten years is in this explosion in the research regarding the micro biome the micro biome is the thirty seven trillion bacteria in your intestines and your coin you have more bacteria in your intestines and corn than you do cells in your body\nAre finding that these bacteria produce byproducts that heavily regulate our hormones regulates information regulates our brain functions this is very very important what we found now as it relates to obesity as it relates to insulin resistance in some resistance is the cardinal feature of most piece EOS patience\nIs that there's a huge tied to pieces of bacteria coming through the intestines at too high of rape not whole bacterial ... pieces of bacteria think of dandy line flowers or other leaves blowing in the breeze and it's like the bloodstream as crop dusted with this stuff\nAnd these leaves for all intents and purposes blocked insulin from binding with the cells of your body so belong in the short of it is you have to secrete more insulin\nWhen you're eating a carbohydrate so now that morning oatmeal\nThat used to be healthy when you were sixteen can now actually be a problem for you ten Fifteen Years later after the micro biome has been shifted towards an inflammatory state\nSo that's where diet is so important and that's what we're talking about with Stephanie and she brought up fasting because now I Am using fasting protocols is one of the things not the only thing but definitely one of the things we're looking at with these us patients why do we use fasting\nWe use it because we're trying to change the gut bacteria research shows that it takes about three months to remodel the gut bacteria through specific nutritional changes but\nSo many of you out there who happy so as sort of your loved one you know some of these us they go on a diet and if it doesn't work you know within a certain amount of time it's so deep moral\nIf there's not a significant amount of weight loss that will then lots of times the diet is abandoned\nAnd [noise] the reason why the diet doesn't work is that some of these got bacteria think of them as\nWhat example should we use in today's society these are bad\nTerrorist bacteria in the intestines that are starting to grow in so many Americans in great abundance because of the diets we eat\nBecause of you take something like a cheeseburger not knocking it but we eat really Saturday high carbohydrate foods all the time in our society is different Kathy isn't it them the way you grew up I mean you guys hardly win out you ate every day you have yeah and we went\nOut for a burger that way [laughter] like rats [laughter] and then he got a military that was Easter so I mean it was a huh yea you ate at home and stuff\nFrom the guard and your mother canned food and everything was much more naturally you didn't have the processed foods that we have today nor did she had the GMO stuff that I think still a lot of people when they go to the grocery store scratch their head and\nDo what the heck is this supposed to be writing and genetically\nModified foods\nAre in the mainstream today and they're they're modified for reasons just so that they get better production in the field and the farmers and at the whole big story that we are eating that stuff and it's not what we ate when I was young and women\nDidn't have the feel as ... and the woman who couldn't conceive with few and far between\nMhm not what we're seeing today so yeah what Stephanie's said if we can take that word diet and just change it to what she said to lifestyle change she ... she turned to hold leaf in her book to where she went from sounds like very unhealthy from a very young age\nTo someone who thinks she's running a hundred and Fifteen Percent [laughter]\nShe's on super high octane because she's eating healthy foods that are feeding that micro biome what I Need\nAnd when you do that in the in some resistance can change sometimes we have to use certain supplements to get rid of these bad bacteria I talked about it and the other piece us broadcast\nFolks they're finding that some of these nutritional herbs are more effective than medications for producing a live birth in peace us patients who are undergoing IDF treatment clinical endocrinology two thousand fourteen\nSo this is big big stuff you know lots of times people discount the importance of diet or lifestyle changes kept you say they discount the power of certain natural substances well the research is out there on this stuff\nIf you have the show as you should start paying attention because you can address this problem at the front side and if you can change the micro biome and you can change in some resistance then there's the probability that you can change how the ovaries or making testosterone\nAnd how much information there is in the ovaries if we can do that that's where my experience we've been able to see the changes were menstrual cycles certain normalizing\nAnd once they start ... oh my goodness now we actually have a chance for something like a pregnancy and lots of times you have to have patience this isn't an over the night process we are such a you know want it now society\nAnd you have to realize that your micro biome has been conditioned and the wrong way lots of times for your entire life I had to come to that realization but\nIf you give it time you actually start re planting this garden and it's more complicated than pro buyout actually if you can actually get this garden ... cultivated now we have a chance for good hormonal structure throughout the body\nAnd in the next segment I'm really going to go into the stress hormone physiology because there are some peace us patients out there who are really thin and we have to focus on them too because lots of times they're forgotten lots of times they're confused because of say well I'm not in some resistance I'm not ...\nUs and there are reasons for that as well any thoughts on that Cathy before we had to break\nI'm not really I think you've got it all together there are I think just important that we get everybody listening and paying attention that it's not just one set model there are varying degrees in here

had to had to find like finding a parking space in your laptop on us going to have\nThe forty ...\nSome more money conventional wisdom just send you the man on a mission to retire when there is one first genetic bums ...\nWelcome back to do on the radio show in the first segment we are talking about goal setting in about a a video that I watch today or by some guy that just doesn't look like he's what he thinks he is a which is a personal business coach because he's saying things like uh don't set a realistic goals do that too many goals less is more\nImportant and always talking about it say how to get across town from my job today I mean this is unrealistic is what it was all about\nYou had been given a set realistic goal from your childhood don't do this don't do that do play in the street you get hit by a car all this messaging you got your entire life leads to wipe quiet desperation think about the lives that were told earlier entirely\nDon't play in the street so you tell your kids do planes street what do you do\nYou take it away their ability to get anywhere because now they're afraid of the street when the truth of the matter is you walk out in the street you can play it at all you want as long as you look you left it looked you write because cars only come from two directions and you watch for big noisy things coming at you then you can play industry do you want\nWell the same thing is to take your money and put forward came I re because it's safe you what you've done as you've taken with the vehicle you take away the vehicle to where you want to be like the wealthy successful financially you can't put your money in a forward in an irate\nSo you've been told your whole life to do these moderately easy thing so\nAnd and you're saving ten percent of what you were under five percent of what you earn whatever now you go out there and you find yourself a spouse and you get married and now you have to go out there by yourself house this expected of using now go and spend your money on a house and the car now your car and house broke and then you get yourself a baby\nAnd then you get two babies and three babies and now you baby broke\nAnd then you're raising these kids in your life is miserable you get up every day you go to work and you're suffering you have a miserable life you come home and\nAfter the Boston Review crap all day long you come home and the kids give you a crap and your wife gives you crap and tells you you got to do all the stuff you don't want to do and you're tired and you're busy worn out but you can't do any of it and you know your kids loved you until they get to be about fourteen after that\nThe older they get the dumber you get and so you have all these things going on your life to make life miserable but every day you got to get up in the morning going dry for an hour to get to work and then work all day long and dry for an hour back\nAnd all this time your money's already know money you're developing no savings or not get any closer to being retired and you realize you have to do this for the rest of your life and then it happens\nRight if you're just you're you're almost nervous breakdowns at this point what you do is you need somebody who love you 'cause nobody else's loving you and so you get yourself a dog and the dog loves you when you come home you got somebody loves you problem is you got to pick up its towards in the backyard so he's leaving you crap everyday to now now you've got more people give 'em your crap\nAnd you do this for thirty or forty or fifty years\nThen you get to the end and you go I did it I ...\nWhat I set out to accomplish I did what the plan was to do I got the kids through college they're out of college\nWe're empty nesters don't really know my wife anymore we really don't have any type of relation anymore but we'll we'll get it back will tend to look back now which she's so old that you know I don't even really want to look at her I'm so out of shape that I really can't do anything if I did\nAnd you know we'll get back we'll try to live sixty five years or life in the next five to ten years\nOf our elderly lives\nExcept for one problem we don't have enough money to do that so I'm gonna have to continue to work part time or or if we do have enough money to retire it's just barely enough and we will not be able to travel the world because we don't have enough money to travel the world we're just going to have to live frugally and go to dinner at four o'clock every day to get the seniors discount right\nThat's right and that was a well late plan that was a serious set of goals that you had for your life\nBut there are mediocre\nWhat good is to set goals that are mediocre this guy is so crazy so out of it\nThat he's teaching the same lies everybody else in life teachers which is less is more don't set unrealistic goals wow and by the way don't set more than one goal right like you shouldn't have a goal that\nBy the time and during my entire Thirty years of working I could stay physically fit that I could create and maintain great relations with my spouse then I have a great cetera relations with my children\nThose goals are too many you can't have them all you got to get that money that you can retire with you got to get that forty years of work under your belt you got to have that big house and you become house poor you need two or three cars eat for college degrees little Billy can't even read or write and he's going to college\nBecause as the goals that were set up as my friends you have a set of goals and they are wimpy they are realistic aboard you really want him just because you\nIn the wimpy doesn't mean you have to be wimpy or that you should be wimpy\nYes we all have the capacity to live a mediocre life a life of quiet desperation we all have that capacity but does that mean we have to use that capacity does that mean we need to live down to society standards\nI don't think so I firmly believe that you need to shoot for the stars\nYou've got to go for something big hey I'd rather go for something big and not get their missed the stars and hit the moon than to go for something moderate that I can achieve\nYour way better off right\nSo to do that we go back to the questions you have to ask the right questions how do I retire in five years now didn't thirty five or forty or fifty years you have to have a timetable and it has to be an unrealistic one\nAnd that's what people do when they come to latch I'm going to retire and five years or less\nYou have to say I want to retire making more\nTaking home more cash then I take home from my job I don't want to retire because I'm living poor no I understand that I make a hundred thousand dollars a year but I only take sixty thousand dollars a year home\nThat's all I take all and that's what I live on after taxes and my four one K. contribution and everything else that comes out of my check so what am I going to do\nI'm going to take home sixty five thousand dollars a year of tax free income and keep it all\nThat water one sixty five thousand dollars worth because I Want to do better than what I did at my job\nI took um sixty now I wouldn't take I'm sixty five so I've got these financial goals but at the very same time I'm accomplishing these goals of the next five years I Want to lose twenty five pounds and I want to keep it off\nAnd I don't want to do something I don't enjoy to do it so I'm not going to do a starvation diet or joined up for one of these stupid diet programs I'm going to learn\nTo eat\nThe moderate way that I should to not only lose the weight but to maintain that while eating foods I enjoy now that's a good goal I'm going to learn to work out in a way that keeps me fit\nBut in a way that I can enjoy so I can maintain for the rest of my life I'm going to work in one or two date nights a week with my wife I don't care that we're so busy with our kids one night a week somebody's got to babysit those kids are going to go to my kids games\nEight hundred thousand dollars with a network than it doesn't really mean anything because it's a very small percentage so they have lowered this return even though they're out there doing stuff that's very successful investments\nBut they lowered the rate of return on those investments by having too much actually\nSo the number one thing that kills an investor is dead equity that's money sitting there doing nothing what are the worst culprits the worst culprits are your personal residence your four one K. and your IRA now I Know you think that you've got\nFour hundred thousand your IRA or your four one K. I'm Sorry you don't because you have to give up half of it to take it out even if you wait until you're six fifty nine and a half you still have to pay your income tax rate on that money to get it out\nSo you don't have what you think in there so it's really kind of delusion you're thinking wow this things making the money but it isn't\nBecause you have never got it if you don't get the money you aren't earning the money this is something you have to understand in Chile you earn money and get it where you can spend you having to say well it's on a piece of paper called my four oh one K. and I see that numbers on that piece of paper getting larger sure and they will in 'til the day they don't\nAnd that day they might go backwards on you\nSo you can't say well I was up to five hundred thousand now I'm Down to three hundred thousand so but I made the two hundred ... know you never made the two hundred thousand guys\nThat's the problem\nYou're not seeing it for what it really is\nYou've got to get that personal residents which you got four hundred thousand dollars you personal ... of your life savings in that house what is it or knew nothing\nDo you still have to pay taxes you pay the mortgage but do you still have to pay the taxes you as you still have to pay the insurance she asked you still have to pay for maintenance and repair yes you still have to pay them you know get to spend time and money to ... to ... whatever that maintenance I guess\nAll of that stuff\nYou have it burned a dime by paying it off none if you get sued\nAnd it's not your personal residents say it's a rental property they can take it away from you\nIt's just the thought of paying off the house is so common yet so ignorant in every way shape and form there's absolutely nothing logical about paying off your personal residence\nOther than this and this is the one logical one and that is you've got so much money cash to invest that you can make the income that you want to make\nWith the money you have liquid\nAnd not need the money in the house but if you cannot make with the cash you have available to you enough income to retire and live the way you want then that money sitting in your house is killing you know let's talk about the guys on the radio the other day he bought nine houses over four years\nAnd turn around and look back and say wow they're all good deals ... we did really well in each one of them but for years later he's got eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nEight hundred thousand sitting there must do some math let me get up to trust the phone here let's do some math just\nTo show you what I mean Iraq he's making four thousand a month for a thousand times twelve making forty eight thousand year divided by eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nHe's making six percent return to see what I mean\nNow what did he invested in those houses he probably invested less than twenty five thousand house will say twenty grand house times\nNine will come up with that number just show you the difference what he thinks he's earning or what most people think they're I mean twenty thousand times nine\nIs a hundred and eighty thousand dollars now take the the um four thousand times twelve forty eight thousand a year divided by a hundred and eighty thousand and he thinks he's making\nTwenty six point six percent return the numbers he's calculated in in the number of seats shared with us was that kind of return in their twenties high twenty returns\nHe thinks he's making twenty six percent return but in reality he's making six percent return on his family's network his network in those houses is eight hundred thousand bucks\nHe thinks it's a hundred and eighty 'cause he's not counting all the dead equity it's just like it's not even there just like your painful home that money's not even\nThere it's just kind of thinking guys that keep you for what I Want you to do\nFirst of all I Want you to figure out if you want to make any money become rich and retire early that's the first job but if you do then what do we need to do then we need to get on top of where your money's going to come from to invest\nOr do we have enough to work to start with without doing anything you just got money laying around we'll do that that if not where's the next easiest place to get the money that cost is the least to go get the money\nAnd we'll take a look at those options maybe it's borrow from your four one K. maybe it's liquidate four one K. maybe it's a liquid that your IRA maybe it's refinance and cash out refinance your house\nYou got rental properties maybe refinancing politically down and maybe it's time to sell them and move on to something larger like an apartment complex those are the kinds of decisions we have to make\nAbout your financial position before you even start making a move because if you start small and collect pebbles you're going to end up with a bucket full of pedals and you're never going to own a rock\nIf you want to own a rock you got to figure out how to go buy a rock\nAnd that rock may mean you have to trade in all your pebbles remember monopoly for greenhouses and then turn it over to a hotel and then three hotels yeah that's monopoly that's what we're playing in life same game\nDifferent name ours is called ... the short break we'll be right back on
