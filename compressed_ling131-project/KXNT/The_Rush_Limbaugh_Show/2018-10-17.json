lot of media uh nobody complained you're doing too much media it'd be a light dip\nOh like it I like getting the point across I've heard you say many times that the economy isn't covered properly and it's not that the economy's not covered properly by these so called mainstream media and it isn't\nA we went up almost six hundred points yesterday and they didn't even have it on the major news you couldn't find it anywhere in\nThe economy is doing probably better than it's ever done in history and they don't even talk about it and that's because they have their opinion and they'd like to keep your opinion going the way they have it they do not treat us fairly and therefore we do the news they owe me on the news so I can talk a little myself\nAnd what about the your tweets and so for these people say we don't want any more tweets everybody ever tried to tell you stopped waiting\n...\nThen he influenced the way they vote that means they will vote Democrat that's what the effort here is

media speculate oh it could be Trump will be removed after the midterms when mullet releases this report it could well be Trump's going to have to be removed to report might all of this is going to happen to one degree or another the second thing\nThis tells me is that Mahler himself is waiving just see who will be running Congress before he decides to really end\nThis because his report goes to Rosenstein\nWho is technically his bosses at the department of justice and to Congress and there is decided whether or not\nThat it is made public so if the Democrats do when the house they're going to insist that Mahler not\nConclude the investor you particularly if he hasn't found any collusion of the Democrats win the house they're going to tell why don't\nWe got time man we can all the time

not but there is no reason other than political\nReasons there's no reason for Mahler to say for anybody to leak\nThat he's ready to deliver key findings no reason to do that other than to have been used as a change agent in the upcoming midterms\nSpecifically Muller is close around during judgment on to the most explosive aspects of his inquiry\nWhether they're very clear incidence of collusion between Russia and ... [laughter] believe me that one of the league long ago there isn't any of that and the second thing is whether the president took any action as it comes to the obstruction of justice\nAnd Bloomberg goes on to say some things that make it look like they're pretending that there's even more being investigated besides collusion an obstruction but there is and\nThen they say there's the question of timing is critical Mueller's work won't be concluded a head of the mid term elections when Democrats hope to take control the house\nAnd and Trump's one party hold on Washington but this time line raises questions about the future of the pro it sells ... single he may replace Jeff Sessions after the election a move that could bring in a new boss for smaller Rosenstein my also resign or be fired by Trump after the election but you notice here\nMueller's work won't be included a head on November six mid term elections when Democrats hope to take control that not every news story is written from the perspective of its impact on the Democrats\nAre the words Mueller's work won't be concluded ahead of them\nHave you had done the Democrats\nAre the words Mueller's work won't be concluded ahead of the November six mid term elections when Republicans corn maintain control about no one ever think of writing that\nThis is out there to create the\nIllusion that Mueller has been gardens and it's only a matter of time before the world is officially told at Trump polluted that's what they hope to create with this\nAnd the media will be helping and it will all the impact votes and again if there was done to be this gigantic blue wave that was not in doubt why would any of us would be necessary let me take a break what's what's next\nIn the ...

fines Democrat and GOP voter registrations at the same level as past election cycles\nA but but but but but but but but but\nThe Democrats had Michelle my bell out there during all do a whole big voter registration drive out there\nThe Democrats have been registering voters in prison and they've been registering voters at the DMV they've been registering voters at the at the at the at the medical marijuana places they've been registering voters everywhere how in the world is it\nPossible that democratic voter registration levels at the same as past cycles the Democrats have been telling us that there's so much energy there is so much\nExcitement there are so much motivation there so much as ... nothing can hold them back and\nYet and yet the generic ballot once again is showing that this massive Democrat blue wave is not as big as once thought now\nNBC is is is very very worried\nThey're worried that something that's not\nA blue wave may be shaping up here that's what this headline news ... certainly they over a blue wave NBC News minds Democrat GOP voter registration at the same level\nAs past cycles comparing registration activity for twenty four team that funny sixteen with activity from twenty sixteen ... current helps put these numbers in the context but it should be noted that twenty fourteen and twenty sixteen include I complete picture\nOf registration in front of those years\nWhereas twenty Eighteen only includes registration activity up until this point in time well what that's all you need them if you're not registered yet the odds are you're not going to be registered in time to vote so it's that seems like a little\nHope will we don't have a full database or numbers for two thousand Eighteen well you've got enough to know\n[noise] [noise] so how can this be how can voter registration if Democrats are supposed to be smoking us\nIn voter registration 'cause there's so much more interest there so much hatred for Trump there's so many people that want to fix that mistake then they call 'em from the Washington Post by Megan McCarthy dull\nTrying to help the Democrats are she believes are morally superior and smarter than Republicans headline will the blue wave collapse before it reaches the shore\n[laughter] [laughter]\nI Can't see this happening but what if\nThere is a lot of pressure brought to bear on mother to reveal this release it are are Rosenstein whoever\nAnd somebody\nLike Trump says well okay hard if you want to see it go have and they release it\nAnd there's nothing that indicates Trump what do you think that does the Democrat turned out\n\nA couple of weeks from now three ... what do you think that does that's why I don't think there's anything in here on collusion\nI don't think there's anything in it on obstruction because folks and what are we just sixteen never Trump anti Trump paid mongers on Mueller's team if they had the guns yeah what a week and it would be leaking right now and it would be used to guarantee a blue\nWave if mother doesn't have any of that there is no way they want this released before the midterms that's why\nThey're linking ... or has it ready they're going to try to take advantage of what they can make people think the report says every member they have two years no more than that and a two and a half years of daddy reporting that Trump and Russia colluded\nSo in their minds they're probably thinking a sizable number of American voters believe the Trump\nCollusion happen so Mueller's report is ready to be released soon that create the impression that it's only a matter of time now before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that way to impact\nAnd it's only a matter of time now before Trump is tied to the Russians were collusion and use that wage impact\nVoting in turn out prior to the mid term Scott I'm just going to tell ya if this report doesn't advance this narrative that Trump cheated and stole the election they're not going to want this up before the midterms\nYou man gyms I'll let down that when you don't know you don't know how many\nOf your base\nCommon ordinary everyday democratic voters literally believe that Trump won this election by cheating with Russia you'd be done at the number of your fellow Democrats citizens in New York and Los Angeles and San Francisco in Chicago who believe it like gospel\nDespite all realm of common sense despite every bit of\nKnowledge we have that there is no evidence for just like how many of them believe ball Z Ford\nTheir politics requires that they believe it's\nMandates they believe that if they are told before them in terms that the smaller report doesn't have this evidence and will not lead President Trump being indicted on that basis what does that do to turn out\nNow don't misunderstand I think Mueller's report whenever it is released is going to really be targeted at Trump\nAs an incompetent as a boom ... who are in gay injured the United states electoral system with his hires and with some of the people on the staff like Carter Page I think they're going to fire both barrels at Trump as an incompetent who nearly brought the world to nuclear Armageddon\nBecause of his confidence in stupidity but I don't think there's going to be any evidence of it\nAnd the fact that there is no evidence is what tells me they don't want this out before the midterms I could be wrong only have to wait and see it won't be long you\nWant me to be said Russia on me I\nLive here on you know I\nHey folks the IRS does not mess

some last minute ... but you know the vast majority obviously are going to vote Republican but you know just keep it out there just keep reminding them of what the alternative is it\nSomehow they decide they are on the fence all of a sudden\n[noise] well I I Try not to do much differently has been trying to be consistent uh all the time of year round and so forth um\nSo important so crucial in

Alabama who shut up\nThat you won't ... well yeah and so you're you're demonstrating your your arrogant white privilege here\n[noise] [noise] yes I Am a [laughter] really uh uh I I was listening to the uh the article from I Believe it was ... that ah ah that they're going to release the mall or a report or sometimes after the election we're ready to that yeah understand\nThat we don't believe that we're not going to believe anything Mahler anyway\nNow that's an interesting point too\nI mean unless the unless uh he implicates or the or an Obama administration and Hillary Clinton and the DNC\nA in a a this investigation including with Russia which they evidently did then you know we're not going to believe anything that report says the [noise]\nI I just don't understand that the drop by media just doesn't get it they're not going to feel as people that voted for Donald Trump away from Donald Trump\nThey don't understand it like a you know the magnificent seven or both guys didn't you know when it came up there they and they didn't check into who they ... what kind of Christians were or or or uh you know if they are\nNot lived a a good life they wanted somebody did offend them and fight against all the things that we see a which have destroyed the country of the last uh eight to ah ah sixteen years\nWell I don't think that the media is right\nNow focused on separating Trump from his voters I think they they know that's too late I don't think that's what their objective here in the midterms is um I think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to and if they could be it would be icing on the cake but I think their primary objective now it's the\nIs um\nI think they're very frustrated they haven't been able to do and if they could be it would be icing on the cake I think their primary objective\nNow is to flood the zone with anti Trump voters Democrats made up of every disparate coalition a group you can find they are trying to assemble this gigantic Democratic Party that as a\nCombination coalition of minority here minority that just constant Adam altogether and get a big majority party and that's that's where they're trying to generate the turnout\nUm\nBecause they know they're not going to distance Trump from uh from his voters\nSo the the focus I think is on joining up a\nFirst time participation\nUm and that's why if this is Suzie as the thing is so important and the inspiration stuff in the anger so that's why I think\nThat they have strategic may become the party of anger I think they are using this anger and they are exploiting it to generate turnout\nBased on what they think is the majority of Americans have hate Trump\nI I think they they do move past the idea that there's a bunch of Trump voters that regret it and can be inspired to show up and vote Democrat as I say if they can make that happen to be icing on the cake\nI think you can see the frustration in them every day you can see the frustration in\nPerusing the news as I Do more and more stories that are starting to raise red flags about the blue wave and there are some\nRussian foreign minister during this on purpose they're sucking you when they're making you think they are given up they're making you think they're trying to despair or you know trying to make you think you got it in the back no they're not going to\nEver pull that off not here not with me\nBut I don't think that's the case either I I don't think that they are I Would have that much discipline to be able to have a media wide threw out the entire left wing media universe\nA disciplined approach to runs fake stories about the blue wave not happening I think it's legit\nI've never I've never believed there was gonna be a blue wave\nI never have\nI'm willing to put that out there and I if I end up being wrong so be it\nI'm not afraid of being wrong it doesn't happen enough times for me to be worried about it but it's this I have never thought because common sense does not suggest that like I said yesterday where is the evidence that Democrats\nHaven't been able to put together a winning coalitions and flooded the elections in when outside of areas they dominate like New York Los Angeles San Francisco Chicago they have been losing elections they had been losing seats left and right starting in two thousand ten that hasn't reversed\nThey didn't win with the cabinet thing they haven't won with anything trying to get rid of Trump they haven't been able to stop Trump on even they're stupid travel uh order delays using the judge is Trump is succeeding implementing his agenda some things he hasn't been able to do it like the total repeal of Obamacare\nBut they have not been able if you you would think if all of these things were true and people hate Trump regret their vote a wish it had never happened regret that Trump is president the pro wouldn't be getting anywhere near done what he's getting done there'd be universal opposition to it if the Democrats are right about all\nThis but they're not write about it I I I the evidence on the ground\nIf the Democrats are right about all this but they're not write about it I I I\nThe evidence on the ground isn't there that there is a blue wave waiting to happen there is evidence all over the place the Democrats are Ross didn't fit to be tied over the fact that they're losing\nYou couple that with their their mentality but says winning is their birthright power is their birthright they're entitled but\nElections haven't been going their way how in the world started to think if all of this that they're saying is true Hillary would've won in the first Trump would have never won in the first place if all this talk of a blue wave right now is true\n\nThey thought they had it in the bag in two thousand sixteen and they were revved an energized too there was one of the talk of Democrats not turning out back then anyway I'm a little long segments going to be short\nFollowed us for that I read
