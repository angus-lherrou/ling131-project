is meddling in that election\nInstead it was the aesthetic that this bomb story has totally destroyed all of the energy you had as what they're reporting out there\n\nIs that what the media is trying to do with all this over the top coverage of this Trump targets bombs received by Trump targets\n\nIf this is indeed the election meddling depending on how it ends up here this could be a pretty

are ... their troubled they are suffering psychological disorders\nThat has been brought on by be on the reading lending hatred they feel over the outcome of the two thousand sixty an election they

to run this another thing to not realize how plain and simple wrong it is and then to justify it based on the Mueller investigation\nWell there's a lot of interest either Mr Limbaugh Muller is looking into the ties between ... and then Trump there aren't any ties between Hillary important\nThere aren't any ties you haven't found any there never worry any they were known to be found there wasn't any

really good common sense points to make that kind of illustrate why we think these packages weren't actually mail 'em ... he's their commonsense questions and the first one\nTo me is how likely is it that someone could mail multiple packages to multiple places all over the country\nAnd having to show up miraculously at the same time inappropriately yeah and the fame they possibly the vaccine timed it that that's not that's not common sense I mean I still see how that could\nJust sort of the deniro packaged didn't arrive until late yesterday or maybe this morning the or George Soros package arrived the\nDay before truth CNN got their little Clinton who support\nThat there was a ... there was a whole group of them that they have like four or five of them shows up all of that same time well how do you know it was a priority mail\nIt couldn't have been I mean if you looked at the packages anyway obviously your first caller is your what I was going to one of the Congress else can they expect that there wasn't enough postage on it even\nThe post office he even accept it um the other thing is these these were these were oversized packages\nSo you're obviously not taking them and and paying for them you know having them weight and paid in profits properly um your you have to stick the post office box right will post office boxes don't even have enough room to slip an oversized package into\nHe got invitations to go to MIT and uh and other schools and really the the device he put together was was not my memory is it was not advanced of\nAll it was a it was almost the exact

Springfield, Massachusetts or next hello sir\nHi Raj cardio I'm good\nGood good I just wanted to dark you know on your point about America giving more than any other nation I think what you were talking about what the government itself but individual also give more than any other nation\nAnd the point is is that I have the choice when I get to charity I give it to I don't have the right how my neighbor who they should give it to and that's actually what the government's doing they're telling on\nWho they are going to basically what they got from our tax dollars they don't give a choice and that's my point\nIt's a good point too it's a classic illustration is reacting to the soundbites we play the John Case there was a wringing its hands and\nGuilt over the facts of caravans coming and it's just for the grace of God that we're not in it\nAnd it because we're not in it but could be in it except by the grace of God we've got to stop building walls 'cause God doesn't want that and we've got to realize that that were just playing lucky it's kinda like written Richard Gephardt out winners of lights lottery\nYou know we were just minding our own business one day and then we got conceived in a woman in America and we've got born into America and and man that's that's so much like that that we shouldn't feel weren't anything special so the fact that we weren't conceived in

so many people strive not to be governor it isn't hard to imagine we don't have a lot of people in fact uh most people in this country go up and down in terms of annual income\nOr people that are in a lot of money and lose it all there are people that are in an average amount of money all their lives and that's it but basically people in this country no poverty\nIf they've never they've never been in it they certainly don't want to be they know enough to know not to be and that's the great thing about America if you don't want to be there are ways to avoid being in poverty poverty in this country by the way it was a relative thing\nCompared to poverty around the world United States poverty is not really poverty I got in trouble Everytime I point that out but it happens to be true\nA statistic lay financially however you want to look at it but but the the way to look at these disparities is not to simply say oh oh that could be me and then to run around and feeling guilty about it\nUh\nThe way to deal with this is not the runaround constantly imagining\nWell you know if there's one accident and I could have been in that you're a man\nAnd then having that\nImpact the way you deal with it that doesn't help anybody it's not a ... but it does make you look like you have lots of compassion and lots of care but that's a great thing about liberalism it never sounds anything\nLiberalism is a\n... choice because she had never have to solve anything all you have to do is talk about how much you care\nAnd all you have to do is tell people how much pain you're seeing and how it makes you so one comfortable to someone fear look at the suffering and the starvation its citizens and you are automatically credited as a person with great compassion you haven't solved anything all you've done to say\nThat you recognize and you're telling everybody else they've got to do something\nAbout it and that's liberalism so lotions\nOr wherever the answer is and solutions to

he has a guy who grow up amazingly believing in the American dream and has lifted he personified as\n\nThey give you a quote from John James people in Michigan know this but I Want people outside you know who this guy is does he has an up and comer I'm a West Point grabbed the end in Iraq vet with two master's degrees my dad was a Vietnam vet and an entrepreneur his dad was a Mason\nHis dad was a share cropper\nAnd his dad was a slave\nMy dad my family never asked for free stuff we just wanted a fair shot we cannot allow the American dream to be crushed\nBy you stabbing now and the socialism that's what John James is twenty three points behind in September seven points behind right now but let's who is Debbie Stabenow she's the incumbent Democrat\n\nDebbie Stabenow second husband I don't think any of you will remember this was the vice president of Air America\nWhich was the failed liberals fund raising and they tried to mount a talk radio competitor E R B network and it failed when they couldn't get any funding and couldn't get on the audience\nThey didn't have any idea about commercial success everything was funding and they ran out of money they ran out of donors after a while and they never amount of doing anything serious anyway but her second husband was the VP she divorced him\nHer second husband when he got arrested in a prostitution ring\nIt was a sting but he was caught up in Debbie Stabenow\nNow has a life of compared to John James few accomplishment she graduated University of Michigan She has given birth to two children she divorced her father she is one civil actions she'd been a commissioner state house representative us representative and the senator\nAnd I look to other other than politics I Can't find where she's worked or or had a a career in anything besides politics she votes one hundred percent with the other far leftists in the Senate\nHer website says she's a true friend and fighter for Michigan\nWebsite says that she has a focus on job creation but she's never created any jobs\nThat Iraq\nAll administration didn't know how to go about doing that in fact the Iraq Hussein ordering this ration ran around Indiana saying up your jobs are gone to never coming back they got to get used to it is a new day coming it's a new economy America kind of end declined you've got to\nFind new ways you got to go to our government job retraining Sanders by the way how are those working for Trump\nIn decline to got to find new ways you got to go to our government job retraining Sanders by the way how are those working for Trump is Trump Trump up with a bunch of job retraining centers like the left always talks about\nThere aren't any new job retraining Trump brought jobs back Trump has reignited an economy that's creating new jobs but the left always comes up with these ... character I guess they sound good to people but they're a waste of time and money\nJob retraining center but how is that what a school for I mean even if you're going to have\nA girl diploma you should be qualified to do something why do you need to go to a job retraining Mr Limbaugh this is true you don't understand this is for people who have\nWho have worked uh and their jobs have left them their jobs have been moved overseas and they don't know how to do anything else other than jobs they were doing about that Republicans have shipped over really so you need to build a job or read training Sanders\nSays people show up and do what they read trained to do what nobody ever tells us what three training is in there that just a bunch of bureaucratic BS\nAnd the proof that they're totally unnecessary as the last two years\nJob retraining centers\nWhy even have schools what the hell are very well see schools today are where you're going to learn about women's studies gender studies climate change studies and all this other garbage that doesn't prepare you to do anything but be miserably unhappy as an activist\nUnable to change anything about all it's worth\nSo in this in this Senate race in Michigan we have a dynamic and a compilation of young African American man West Point grad\nTo a graduate degrees running against the old white woman the privilege\nWhose life accomplishments are winning elections which no chump change there I mean it's not hard it's not it's it's not easy but that's it\nNo I meant to say that she's white she's an
