of health with Dr Randall gates specializing in chiropractic neurology\nAt gave way to help we help you get into the real cause of your medical problems using non drug treatments if you have questions about near a logical disease chronic pain for any auto immune conditions color show now at seven oh two seven three three cats in the seven three three five nine six eight\nNow [noise] it's way down with Dr Gates [noise]\nThe morning every one Dr Randall gates board certified chiropractic neurologist also a chiropractic physician that gates way to health we have a location in Henderson as well as in Reno\nAnd we deal with a lot of auto immune diseases chronic neurological problems from a natural perspective a non drug perspective and today we're talking about fire Roy and fatigue so if you're fatigued if you hit the afternoon and you're tired\nThan you really need to maybe have your thyroid tested not so many of you had your thyroid test and you're to hold that you know you're absolutely normal and we're going to go into all of those details and I'm joined by my friend Cassie today Cathy are you there\nWill Sam good morning\nYou're mourning mourning so Kathy what are your thoughts on ...\n[noise] well I Can't tell me why we're doing the broadcast today why thyroid and critique\nEven though the thyroid has gained more notoriety now that social media is such a part of our life and a lot of people are searching on Google for answers to their health issues there's still a lot of misunderstanding out there about the thyroid and how somebody can have a third issue but their doctors will tell them that they don't\nAnd it's a really really big deal it's very very important because the pirate issues effect primarily women and there are a lot of women out there who struggled with weight gain or they struggle with\nThe tea or the struggle with constellation or they have abnormal menstrual cycle legs and the thyroid can really relate heavily to all of that or you know somebody with fibromyalgia thigh return related you know somebody vertigo\nDiary can relate significantly and you have to dig deeper than what is typically done for most patients who have you know the third investigations out there so that's why we're talking about they are today\n[noise] and when a person tells the doctor that they are ... what is their doctors thinking\nOkay so when you go to your doctor and you say hey I have fatigue your doctor's first going to try and rule out some systemic illness with your doctor has to rule out things like cancer or other more serious you can say it this way auto immune disease or something like Lupe is\nThey have to try to get to the bottom of it maybe they're thinking you have sleep apnea but once those investigations have been drawn out and it appears that you don't have one of those conditions\nThen your doctor lots of times is going to think maybe you're depressed and many people who are fatigued are told that they're depressed now why is that fatigue as a central component of depression [noise] now there's two sides to this\nAnd the doctor side is that if somebody is fatigued and maybe they're not enjoying their activities as much as they used to\nAnd the doctor side is that if somebody is fatigued and maybe they're not enjoying their activities as much as they used to\nAnd perhaps they're just a little bit down maybe they cry more often maybe their sleep patterns are disrupted use the patient have to realize that you're fulfilling the criteria for having depression and your doctors trying to give you a solution they don't have a lot of times so therefore they're going to say you know what I think you're depressed\nI'm not saying this happens all the time but this is what I hear mostly from chronic fatigue patients are patients ... on the patient side of it they're going to say well I'm not depressed if I Am depressed it's only because I'm tired and that's the patient viewpoint on it so that's kinda how we come to this crossroads so to speak of fatigue patients being told that they're depressed\n[noise] why aren't lab tests more commonly used confirmed the patience to take\nA lab tests or use it more often because you have to realize that the insurance companies dictate what lab test can be run and that's a big big point for all of you to understand so when you go to your doctor most of you don't realize that your doctor in some circumstances has really handcuffed\nBy the lab tests they can order on a routine basis and yes there are circumstances where they can order more labs but oftentimes if their contract with the insurance carrier the insurance carriers will say you know you're ordering more labs and we want to see ordered\nAnd that puts a lot of stress and strain on doctors also there you know a health care policies out there that say you know you only need to check for this or you only need to check for that\nAnd that really dictates of why we get a cursory examination of our thyroid so if you're suspecting that you have a third issue if your hair is getting thinner if your eyebrows are thinner if you're gaining weight like I said if your voices ... you may need to think\nI haven't had all this Ira tests done and you as the consumer out there needs to understand that they are at least eight tests that can be run for the thyroid\nBut commonly you're getting one or two of them in some of the most important tests as it relates to fatigue or not commonly run so that's a really really important point that we have to drive home so if you have these symptoms you have to be your own advocate and so many ways you have to find somebody who is gonna run these tests\nTo figure out these problems and that's what we do a gateway to health\nAnd that's really the cornerstone of our practice we figure out problems when patients don't have answers also\n[noise] okay so that is why I mean just you and they want her to test that's why people aren't getting their answers or why they're kind of back and fan or die really just normal when in actuality they do have some sort of problem\n[noise] exactly and again that may be hard for a lot of you to swallow a lot of you to comprehend you also have to realize that there there are different ways of saying if somebody has a tired issue we're not for example let's go through some pirate hormone physiology\nSo that's really important how she motivations have much much much more significant reactions to foods than non ...\nSo these factors have to be addressed because it's like your military which is your immune system is in your gut as we say an advertisement your immune system is in your intestines it's in your colon\nSo that's the explanation there Cathy I think we can go to a break and or any other questions that you had\nNow will pick it up I never got a lot to talk about in the ... and more genetics and some other things so\nOkay sounds good so you're listening to the gates way to help the radio show if you have a ... if you have a loved one was the third issue do you think they have and they haven't been properly tested give us a call eight three three Dr Gates eight three three three

morning everyone\nDr Randall gauge board certified chiropractic neurologist also ... musician at gates weighed a health we have a clinic in Henderson Upper West horizon ridge parkway also clinic in Reno we deal with\nImmune conditions chronic pain chronic neurological conditions migraines vertigo dizziness\nAll these sorts of things confessions were doing really really exciting stuff with concussions at this point in time but auto immune problems lots of times under lie a lot of these neurological problems which is why I focused so much on the thyroid\nAnd the thyroid as the nuanced hype of Oregon and oftentimes will use the patient are getting a cursory examination of your third I don't mean that as a den of Greece into your doctor's not one bit\nBut the fact is that the system is kind of put your doctors in that position and they're\nI'm tired and stay tired all day long and they're told they're depressed and they argue vehemently that they are not depressed\nAnd that's where you can understand this relationship to the thyroid between fatigue it will help you also will go until later on the broadcast about stress levels even things like early life circumstances that word verse and how that can affect energy levels how that changes genetics\nSo that's one area where genetics can change is called methylation of your certain genes and that's really important as well so we kind of went through siren hormone physiology some of the underlying causes of how she motives I re died us Kathy did you have any thoughts on that before I go further\n[noise] why is it over a hundred years versus a doctor how she Modesto\nWhat's his last how cruel yeah butler\nOr why is it taking so long to for his work to take root so that people are understanding north and utilizing it\nAnd getting to the ... it's not mentioned in in regular as [noise] college many books and so forth I've had him shoved in my face people showing me hey we don't talk about this they did it to test we do for thyroid and that's it right\nSo why is it taking so long\nI think taking so long because it finally took almost like a revolt or it's severe dissatisfaction by thyroid patience for that to get out there and then for alternative doctors namely to start talking about this and started saying hey this auto immune problems of the thyroid\nIs an issue that nobody's paying attention to and I think that's really prompted a lot of these and P. H. D. scientific researchers to start delving into this and they're seeing that the alternative doctors in large part were correct\nAnd I would just say basically the way our health care system is developed we have a hormone replacement model for the thyroid and that's what we have at this point it's kind of interesting because\nIf you think of Rome rheumatoid arthritis gives me rheumatoid arthritis\nWhat do you do for rheumatoid arthritis you all see the advertisements on TV at night for these different medications like ... and ... and you see somebody you know playing golf all of a sudden that couldn't play golf before will these new biologic medications it's all about\nCalming down auto immune responses to the joints of rheumatoid arthritis patients\nWe don't give her rheumatoid arthritis patient cartilage to fix the rheumatoid arthritis\nSo that illuminates that we have an auto immune approach for rheumatoid arthritis but we don't have that for the fire it basically the the understanding as well you know if your loans are able to give you a third medication hopefully you feel better you know and see you later and that's why you've had doctors show you the textbook saying hey this is all we test for\nBecause that's what they knew to do that's what they've been trained to do and use the patient need to have Temperance for your doctors to an understanding your doctors can't be responsible for every new research article out there if you're going to see a general practitioner\nThey're responsible for so much information to keep you alive they keep you well you have to give them that credit\nBy the same token if you're not getting the answers you need to dig deeper and say okay well maybe I Need to take the these matters into my own hands and that's one thing I really enjoy working with patients who listen to this radio show because they tend to have that tenacity they tend to be very independent and wanting to figure out their problems\nWhich lends itself well to dealing with medical problems that haven't been able to be figure it out before that so that's kind of the explanation for that county\nAnd that's kind of what happens is that people try traditional medicine long and asked they don't get the answers then yeah you kind of have to start paying independent and start thinking for yourself because you feel so bad\nTraditional medicine long an aspect don't get the answers then yeah you kinda have to start paying independent and start thinking for yourself because you feel so bad\nAnd it's gone so long that you feel like there has to be something out there is someone has to have an answer and you read from a research title nine them you have as many our answers is anybody out there [laughter]\nI Try [laughter] I Try as we all I Do my religion\nYou do do a blood test that we're talking about it gets like how you can order that was\nKind of answers laid uh-huh for sure we can dig lots of times as deep as you want to do so we can run tests to figure out are your gastrointestinal back to your abnormal and what where the abnormal what do we need\nTo duty either kill off the bad guys or replenish the good guys we look at dies we can check you for every food intolerance under the sun\nQuarters all is our stress hormone what they're finding is that patients who are chronically fatigue tend to have low cortisol\nThis led a alternative practitioners to say this is called adrenal fatigue this is what is happening in all these patients who have low energy levels it's called adrenal fatigue it's because you've been stressed\nWell the new research is actually find that it's not really adrenal fatigue adrenal glands can keep pumping out more months for as long as they need to but it's the brain the brain actually changes\nIn people who are chronically fatigue meaning the brain stop sending the signals to the adrenal gland to make the cortisol\nAnd I alluded to earlier in the broadcast that it was a genetic change and researchers are finding that the receptor for a quarter of all in the brain actually changes\nAnd its methylation genetically so when the body is producing these receptors the receptors or not produce it the right rate you can think of it that way and so we don't receive cortisone normally in that kind of leads to a down regulation of the entire system\nFor the cortisol feedback loop and this is why so many chronic fatigue patients are fatigued and researchers are even finding trying to find new ways to jumpstart this access between your brain and your adrenal glands\nNothing definitive yet but I always say I will say alternatively this is a really important point also when quarters all goes low adrenalin tends to be high end researchers are also finding this can lead to imbalances in the immune system and it's also hypothesized that this is why\nChronic fatigue patients have higher levels of inflammation\nThan people who don't have chronic fatigue\nSo if you've had all this checked and you're a chronic fatigue patient than I Will applied the doctor who's checked it but this is what we do and think about it gates would help when somebody tells me they have low energy certainly I'll Try to run the blood tests and I'll do the studies\nJust say okay is there anything else going on here that would cause us but once I saw that as a lemonade as a possibility you really have to think your teeth into these deeper elements of the thyroid we didn't even talk about sub clinical hypothetical isn't a lot of you have thyroid test where you're told a your diary this kinda borderline\nYou know you're right on the borderline you kind of in a gray area\nWe're not going to put you on a medication at this point well for those of you who are borderline or just a little bit high both irate if you're told that\nYou need to pay attention because researchers are finding that this is called sub clinical hype of fired ism in sub clinical hypo ... can be associated with things like fatigue also this low T three syndrome so you have to have all the tests run to figure out if these are issues\nAnd if that's interesting do you give us a call ... three three Dr Gates eight three three three seven four twenty eight thirty seven because we'll sit down with you for an hour and a free consultation with myself and my team to go through your history I Want to know everything because if you're going to come in and we're going to really try to make an effect\nOn your thyroid on your energy levels and whatever else\nThat's really bothering you from a health perspective or a psychological perspective addressing physiology any thoughts on that Cathy\n[noise] um no I just know how thoroughly [laughter] and from start to finish the answers that you get can make all the difference in how someone feels this is what's that my experience in the past [noise] mhm\nI appreciate that and for those of you out there saying well this is totally new you know I read an article this morning October ... it was published in October it's from the journal underground the title of the article is called cognitive functioning and quality of life and patience with hockey motives Ira died as\nOn long term leave with rocks and replacement what does that mean they're looking at quality of life mental health impatient\nBut it was there a diet is on long term leave with rocks and replacement what does that mean\nThey're looking at quality of life mental health and patients who have how she noticed I read I just who are taking medication what did they find they found what's been found that so many research articles before this\nThat it's really the auto immune problem to the thyroid that's the issue the immune information to the ... doesn't just go to the third the information goes right your entire body they have you ever had a cold\nWhen you have a cold how do you feel do you feel on top of the world or do you feel kind of down\nMost people feel kind of down to feel kind of less confident when they have a cold\nThey may not be able to think of course that's because you're getting immune information into your brain well if you're a siren patient\nYou can have brain fog or let's say this way if you had brain fog and fatigue you really need to be tested for how she motives because these are the factors that can lead to information in the brain and the information in the brain can actually be associate with other immune chemicals to the brain that we don't even have names for yet\nAnd this may be why you're not feeling the stellar as you would have been the past\n... I think we've got about a minute to break any other thoughts\nOn that I Would actually associated with depression itself is that young side effect\nUnequivocal so they've done studies in inpatient psychiatric facilities and they found the upwards of thirty three percent of those hospitalized have hockey modus erudite is thirty two percent other studies\nAnd lots of times these are incorporating meals so you may have heard me mentioned like one out of three females in some studies ... motives but these days are really important because they have meals and there's well unusually\nUh the meal or sees me the female to male preponderance of how she Moses tend to one so when you start seeing more and more harshly motives and depressed patients you have to pay attention\nAnd they've actually found that ...\nSeems to reduce blood flow to the frontal lobes the frontal lobes are the front part of the brain where you're positive emotions come from the front part of your brain where you are able to pay attention to things to think clearly and also to shut off stress responses\nVery important part of ... function so yes tired issues are associate with depression not only from ... perspective but for sure also hormone perspective so yes\nSo I think we're going to the break you're listening to the gates way to health radio station eight three three Dr Gates eight three three three seven four twenty thirty seven we will see you after the break\n\nThe all new radio dot com app is available now it's a totally new experienced it puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone\nFor any way [noise]\n[noise] ranger station part it OK fire smoking so you're drowned the fire started grounded again and felt that it was cold\nI mean it's just let me know you did good Smokey Bear\nI'm going to let you go there\nAre many ways to start a fire but one sure way to put it out learn as you can do your part Smokey Bear dot com sponsored by the U.S Forest Service counter state forester\nQueens have mastered the art of tuning out Jen is a spider in the car\nReturning to room into a home gym\nThe that but some messages need to get through like making sure they're buckled up the whole ride every time\nThe all new radio dot com that is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com apple on your smartphone\nFor anywhere\n[noise] ranger station I reported air hog okay I Know my campfire and smoking to me\nSo you're drowned the farthest started grounded again and felt that it was cold\nI mean it's just like you know you did good\nOr hug from Smokey Bear\nI'm going to let you go there\nAre many ways to start a fire but one sure way to put it out learn how you can do your part Smokey Bear duck sponsored by the U.S Forest Service I count on your state forester\nQueens have mastered the art of tuning out Jen there's a spider in the car\nReturning to room into a home gym\nThe better but some messages need to get through like making sure they're buckled up the whole ride every time I Do whatever it takes to make your childless Jen I friend is your boyfriend late blight book club sweetie [noise] never give up until they buckle up\nLearn more safer car dot Gov slash kids buckle up\nA message from the national Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the ad council\nGigi B.

today we're talking about your personal growth argue growing are you doing anything about it or are you coming home at night after living this life require desperation coming home and I just telling yourself\nTurning your light bulb off at night watching TV becoming brain dead you realize when you get off of work with every time you get up by the time you get home and you eat dinner there still three or four or five hours left at night you can get something done\nI Would suggest either what you need to do is you need to start thinking about investing in yourself\nBefore you start investing money out here we're going to talk about a dusting money today to do get wrong we're going to get to that but before you spend any time going out there in dusting money I think you need to invest money in education for yourself\nWhat types of education I think you need to know so far the kitchen a motivation\nYou know where do you want to be in life what do you want to be in life where you go in your life you know you hear this over and over and over again but like I said until I got up your goals that okay I'm already where I Want to be that's a very easy thing to say I am a piece of garbage middle class human being\nI have a decent job I have a decent uh I have a decent home I have a decent this kid blah blah blah I was listening to a park yes yes\nThey shouldn't have poor with anybody that wasn't rich he said poor people are greedy and selfish individuals\nAnd his definition is the explanation was pretty interesting you said you know poor people are all about me me me and uh that's about as selfish is going to be what can I earn what is my paycheck\nWhere do I live what do I drive however my kids what grades to my kids yet he said if you've ever heard any more sickening and cry baby ... self centered is that instead of what can I Do to improve the world\nWhat can I Do to grow my resources to where I have enough to give away and he's talking about rich people are way\nWay way\nNicer than poor people now that is so different than what you believe but I'll tell you this if you go to a poor person's house and you meet their kids and their family and the wife and husband you'll find that the husband and wife don't share their financial information sometimes even with each other\nAlmost always not with their kids their kids learn nothing about finances because the parents won't talk about him because the parents are embarrassed about what they're doing with their money\nThey are not growing a family legacy they are piling a little bit of money into an account hoping that some day we'll get them by and the darkest moments of their life to survive\nThey are planning for mere survival they're already living a life of quiet desperation now they're planning for a life of mere survival where is the abundance in that\nPoint of view can you share that with me where is there something about\nWow my family is going to have a wonderful life because I Want them because I Want to go and have the ability to help my church I Want to have the ability to help other people like it lifestyles that thirty five thousand clients\nMany many many of which you've already retired hundreds maybe thousands of them have retired uh how many people more can I help how can I make help quicker faster better\nThose are the kinds of things that millionaires get up and think about how can we do more faster and better for those people out there\nNo worry about ... comes back to me because it's going to come back to me\nIf I put enough out there in the universe the universe is going to bring enough back to me if you don't right now have enough going on in your life to make you where do you want to be if you're not where you want to be you're not putting enough out their guys you're not out there putting it out making it happen creating activity in your life\nYour circle of influence is a symbol\nOf the world\nEvery time you buy something and you invest in something an asset a business you now have influence over a larger group\nOf people and you make their lives better if you've ever read house do you have a nice right now so people happy there have you influenced their happiness\nIf you have an apartment complex hundreds of people are they happy there have you influenced their happiness are you out there producing happiness in the world so that you can return receive your of bonded return\nOr are you sitting on the couch why\nAnd the world so that you can return receive your bonded return\nOr are you sitting on the couch watching and being pissed off at Nancy Pelosi which is a complete idiot or any other one of the middle east has hundreds of politicians you could just look at right now you can go now to listen go idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot I don't know how we elect people\nI think we go the dumber they are the better chance of them getting elected\nBut what's worse is not only do you're lucky to sit and listen to 'em like they actually know something those guys no nothing they will not help you or your family get where you want to be\nThere out there to stop you from getting where you want to be that's what government does government doesn't help you it stops you it takes away from you steal from you it doesn't help you in any way shape or form\nGovernment buys pure nature is something that has to sucked\nIn not give out right so why do you spend all your time paying attention to these idiots it doesn't make any sense right\nSo what should you pay your attention to you should be paying your attention to those things which will help to expand the universe\nAnd return those positive will bring back to you and your family did do that you have coming to you from putting out all of these positive things in the world\nBut you can't do that if you go home at night and shell out in front of the TV you can't go home at night and just crashed yourself down with alcohol like I was doing for a couple of years it doesn't work\nThere's no way you were at the end the second you pick up the bottle and started drinking it's done for the day period you're over I Know I did it and you would ask me well why don't you stop all my defense was I don't want us to\nSee I could admit to myself as a millionaire is actually a multi millionaire I'm not going to call myself a mega multimillionaire but multimillionaire and access up\nI was very happy with who are out their bodies coming in businesses are working everything's operating and say well why can't I sixty to just sit back and relax and the answer is not really sitting back and relaxing what I'm doing this pickling myself\nCash thirty right thirty\nMillion in cash that can be sped we're I Need to invest it to make the money I Need I don't have it in buckets\nIt may be in probably about thirty or forty different accounts because I've got it spread out so that there's insurance FDIC insurance on but the bottom line is it's their edits waiting for the next\nBig deal I don't want it there I wanted a deal I Want to buy more income so let's take a look\nI can take I'm going to buy an apartment complex right now I can take a part of that money\nAnd that money right there probably are as me somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually earning two percent of most of my savings accounts but so let's say I make three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest eagle boy do that's incredible I could live off that the rest of all I'd go oh that's terrible\nThe rate of return on that investment is terrible\nNow I go out and buy an apartment complex I met in the process of buying one right now when I buy that apartment itself cost me nine or ten million dollars which I'm not expecting you to understand is just take the generals off of all of this discussion\nAnd it will make me between nine hundred and a million dollars a year\nNow what's interesting about that is it will make it for me in tax free income\nIn addition to that I mean it's about fifty thousand dollars a month in income if you look at it that way but not counting the other auxiliary or ancillary type incomes and it makes up a little bit about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around see fifty times twelve is six hundred thousand dollars\nAnd so Larry type incomes and it makes up a bit about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around see fifty times twelve a six hundred thousand dollars\nBut it's paying down the mortgage another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year\nNow what's interesting is the depreciation on this which is the ability to earn income without paying taxes on is somewhere around a million dollars nine hundred and some thousand dollars so all that incomes going to be tax free\nRight\nAnd in addition to that because of the new tax laws that Trump past I'll probably get another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of deductions right out of the blocks the ride off against my other income in other things\nSo you think about this I'm going from let's say nine hundred thousand dollars or any one percent is nine what would that be Ninety thousand a year or two percent a hundred and eighty thousand you're going from a hundred and eighty thousand a year\nTo almost a million a year in income the hundred and eighty thousand would have been taxed\nAnd the millions of years tax free you know what on Trump doesn't really shows tax returns 'cause he make billions tax free you my friend every dime you put into that a savings account you're paying income tax on that or if you're putting it into four one K. and you're a you're not paying taxes this year\nBut somewhere along the line when you take it out you had to pay taxes on\nWe are going to avoid taxation both when we are in it and then later when we sell the property we're going to ten thirty one that forward and get out of paying it at that point also so you see what you're looking at here is the ability to earn ten times as much income\nAnd early with no taxation so you look at a family\nAnd you say we're should your money ...\nShould your money be at some places you know when you get your financial point of view we can draw down four percent a year and we won't run your money out until you're eighty years old nine years old me they're really only earning two percent a year and then they're drawing down in the principal and the other two percent\nBut what did you could earn ten percent\nNow I'm not even throwing in there all the other ways we income for example when we buy properties many times we buy them in a distressed situation and we go in and we fix them up and we have immediate income from that we call that force appreciation\nForce appreciation is massive\nIf it's wraps around the rule the ten twenty five one hundred rule a ten percent increase in income because of the approval of the property ... twenty five percent increase in value since we only have twenty five percent down payment or equities only twenty five percent that twenty five percent increase in value means we have a hundred percent\nGain on our investing a hundred percent gain on your best they can you imagine if you can increase your income or your investment network by a hundred percent of your\nHouse that's unbelievable\nWe also have that thing we're thing called appreciation you know rent just keep going up values just keep going up we're getting all that while you're money sitting there and it's the inflation is depreciating your money\n\nWe have the tax advantage of depreciation and the other one is when we produce these massive cash or capital gains we can refinance and pull that money on tax free tax free do you understand that so we can pull out hundred two hundred five hundred million dollars\nTax free you understand that so we can pull out hundred two hundred five hundred million dollars that pay no taxes\nWhatsoever you're not doing that\nYou are living a life of quiet desperation mediocre like that you're living by a set of rules are going to keep you there\nThe reason you're stuck there is because you are not make yourself out at whatever level you're living at right now whatever it is you get up today and said I Am me I Am proud to be what I'm saying is\nDon't be proud to be you be proud to be the man your becoming\nI Am proud to be the bad are becoming I'm happy with what I've done so far I'm satisfied but I've not done we'll take a short break be right back

I feel sorry for the person who took my position at the heart and right now and they're working hard\nI'm sure they don't really care do they know where they are a pound or to get your sales right your time and it was just impeccable it was perfect yeah\nLos Vegas builders the fast rapid sales and record prices this year in last month's results do not show the construction marketed slammed on the brakes but sales have dropped in several master planned communities and the region's weekly deal flow has ticked lower um we're going to go into this when we do our housing\nA housing numbers next

Fifteen Years Fifteen Years good fat I words or less might have some ... you might have problem although ... air air and I were ...\nIt's going to be in their Fifteen Years Fifteen Years good yeah I words or less might have some problems you guys might have problem although ... air\nAir and I were talking about this before you remember this Aaron where when ... when we were doing new home sales years ago in like twenty some years ago when people came in ... new homes you nobody ever came in and said what's the what's his house going to increase or appreciate ... people in use those terms because they they were buying\nOne of the house to live that they want ... it wasn't until years he was until the well after we all got burned yeah about that but I\nBut I mean you know so so the thing about new homes or re cells or whatever and and maybe we're getting back to that now is just you know um if if you're buying a home as a home or in as far as investments WB better in the long term anything else right that's that's the major\nI've got I've got some feedback on that we would all as you can we all know\nTwenty six hundred if you'd like to call us and still not be on the screen door found seven oh two seven three five Ninety six eight alright if you wanna get embarrassed\nSpeaking the XP realty I did some research for the show somebody has through\n[noise] [laughter]

continues he XP release commitment to providing the best innovation\nAnd technology for their age and so there you go that's common guys\nWe have a a reason you might want to go check out your I think there was an a daddy show hasn't joining us here pretty soon that we know pretty well right absolute was that age um\n[laughter] and say oh I just lost my a assistant producer and we've got a\nCall ... ... let's say I had lots of them as I don't know what the heck I'm doing Larry welcome to the show\nNope there we go Larry there\nLarry Larry ... you ever watch and practical joker is Larry Larry [laughter] running up and down\n\nAll right well when he got some technical difficulties that's what happens when a\nHere me oh you are Larry your hair you are here that then okay where to go murdered yet what I said that's funny\nAnd I'll just get right to it sounds like a winner go ahead the reason\nThat nobody's crawling yet I think it's because new home buyers are not as influenced by what you all talk\nRight I mean what do you think it is very\nWell I think that as a second time third time homebuyers are more interested in what you think about what they pay is it going to be good or bad higher or lower next year\nAnd the interest rates are going to be a stable and the last thing is one of one of the year is your opinion about paying over the price price comes in more than a bold much lower than you did say by a couple of points\nI think Larry that pain over appraisal\nIt was in more than a bold much lower than you did say by a couple of points\nBut I think Larry that paint over appraisal if you're going to pay five ten thousand ... yeah that was that was so first and second quarter I think as a mentor a rise is you don't have to do that anymore but but the other thing you said I think you might have hit one of the nails on the head is that you're right first\nTime homeowners are more than likely to go buy a new house bloods are more excited exactly they enter in there in the sky like I don't care I'm buying a brand new ... right I'm not really worried about and then\nLarry liking for us it's gotten two three four homes were looking at more as well get we're more mature now we're looking at it as more as the investment right we're not getting overpaid for something that was just like I agree right Larry and then like you I mean there's a lot of more mature people that they'll only by a car that's two years old now because they understand\nThey learned their lesson got the guy on the phone that will never buy another new card right years old that's my ideal you sound like you're my age I'm thirty five [laughter] I'm over thirty five [laughter] thirty five when you weren't even born\n[laughter]\nWell you're right to point I mean we we do focus on first time homebuyers but uh I you know our comments about brand new homes we try to really show\nIs great don't get me wrong\nYeah but we're trying to get the the word out that we're not telling people not to buy a brand new homes but we're giving her opinion that it it is a risky investment right now the air you know way overpriced compared to what they should be from past you know sales gaps so to speak you know the the\nCase in Shiller index and and you know and they're starting to really slow down\nYou know the bar you ... new homes you just got back from doing it you know when builders stop you know charging a ton of money for a lot of premiums and that starts to go down and when they started giving you guys are real estate agents like eight points to come by their house right that's the tea leaves of new\nHome sales aren't doing so great right now we're not seeing base prices go down yet and that's that well that's going to come right and that's when it's really you guys if you're buying a brand new house and they say yeah we're dropping the base price on you yeah you may want to think twice about\nSo Larry there's there's two types of people\nThat buy new homes the one that you said is probably the first time buyers [laughter]\nThe other one or the people from California that come over here with millions that don't care 'cause someone's trying to find a hundred thousand now they're paying cash yeah they're paying cash for that million dollar house 'cause they sold their is in California for two million dollars\nMight just want to tell you something tell us I have\nWhat seven first time homes new rules that my life and a\nSeven first time I worked for the time it was new and I'm not a are okay and one was in New Jersey rider Larry no no no no no it was all night okay should I Know I had asked me\nThe other side of Indiana 'cause they like it and killed me\nStaying in the same ...
