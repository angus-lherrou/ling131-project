the a narrative the top narratives are at a soap opera scripted today\nSeems today at one of the overriding concerns among the drive by is the president's relationship with Rod Rosenstein the debate\nToday centers on whether or not Rosenstein was kidding or not in a meeting with other FBI officials when he suggested wearing a wire the next time he wouldn't talk to the president\nWhat's compounding this orchid abusing people is that Trump is not fire Rosenstein in fact had Rosenstein up to the White House in men had him on air force one flew him around them got off the airplane with him\nSo they have a good working relationship the president still will not declassify\nDocuments that Devon newness and a number of other people want the classified which would answer a whole bunch of questions about the soft coup\nAnd who really started it and when and where and all of that and the presidents\nAnd I talked to Rosenstein and frankly told Fox News today in the morning on the phone I'm a I don't understand why he won't tell people I had a great conversation when there are some things he told me that need to be under oath\nSo the drivers are confused because Trump\nDoctor Rosenstein Rosenstein told Trump everything you wanted to know Trump says I don't see anything wrong with it but then roses and I will go up and talk to Congress in Trump's not making him do it so people can't figure out what's going on\nLet me tell you how to observe this or how to deal with trust the Trump knows what he's doing here\nThat's all I can tell you don't fall for the fact that

dismembered and taken out of there in various diplomatic pouches and will never be seen again this is why the president others are being\nTo find out what happened because we have an allied relationship with the Saudis and we cannot tolerate this if this is how the Saudis are going to treat their journalists\nNow the relationship we have a Saudi Arabia always has been very little

still going to use it to say that even though Trump last he tried to steal the selection of Hillary and it was that\nWas going to validate her election even more that was going to make her an even bigger star an even bigger he wrote she overcame not just Trump She overcame ... she overcame the oligarchy she overcame Russia that's what their plan was\n\nAnd then it got turned upside down Hillary last and she refused to concede\nRemember she refused to go away they refused to acknowledge the Trump and one in immediately became Trump didn't win the Russian stole it\nAnd to this day there's no

fine so your job and your next step up from ...\nYes and my entire adult working life has been in an economy in decline and not only have you [laughter] which has\nBeen a real pleasure you've I've listened to you for many years\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton have been in the public eye and in particular and and my generation my whole life\nShe you know I remember Hillary as first lady and working on health care and and to see this attack from the last um it can\nHis finances and as someone who is the in my country get poorer we don't have any money but people who do have a I Am ready to play the where did you get your money from game especially concerning our Senate and Congress\nI I find it hypocritical an unbelievable that these people who are completely there just have no self awareness\nWould be you know hounding Trump going after Trump\nFor my part of it I Do not plan on abandoning my president it is the first time in my adult life\nThat I Am in an economy that is growing I was just old enough and walking out into the workforce when NAFTA was really taking hold and the and and companies were leaving leaving leaving leaving not coming back\nAnd the like you say and I could not agree with you more the wife has nothing to run on but for my generation to generation who won't have Social Security is gonna bomb out we're broke were ten trillion dollars and that's when I hear\nA leftist talking about uh all of these things that they want to pay for you know Medicare for all it's a it's a lovely idea but\nWe don't have any money to exactly right there isn't any\nChristmas you and making a really important point that I don't want to gloss over I Want to return back\nTo be a primary\nPoint you've made that you are in your mid forties I'm for the first time in your life your living through a growing positive economy that prior to now your entire life has been lived in a either a flat line or a shrinking economy\nYes it's hard and you know let's not forget something for most of that time in the last eight years prior to Trump people like you were also told that this was as good as it go and get that you had to work and acknowledge that there was a new normal now and that America's\nGreat days of the past may not have been totally legitimate and ended this this was more like the way it's going to be now\nSo you were also told not only where you at a flat lining economy your told don't have any lawfully expectations here\nRight ... exactly how how let's jump forward to this growing autonomy my next question are you actually there is no wrong answer here it's not a trick\nAre you actually aware of the growing economy because you're living and experiencing are only are you aware of it because you see economic numbers reported that say it's good\nI I'm In a small economy in Asheville North Carolina that is its own separate\nEconomy so I'm aware of it the ah\nInformation but I can I can feel it I can sense that I can I'm I Know that it's true that is that if I mean it's hard to build your life\nIf you if you're coming if you're coming from nothing and don't have anything and you're trying to build a life\nAnd and I literally feel like the finances in America there's been the ... hold on to this depletion of it I mean I'm old enough to remember\nSitting around the table and my parents and you have to finish your dinner there's children starving in China when I was growing up everyone knew that China was a core poor poor poor place\nAnd just a in a span and just uh\nIt's ... am I happy for the for the people of China absolutely we don't want to see anyone in the world struggling and and and not have what they mean to survive but on the other side of it\nIt's because of poor management and our government that has lead to all of this money out of our country and and people here are suffering and you talked about the opioid epidemic and and and all of these you know these the fruits the fruit of having no work\nWhich he used to be just standard knowledge you knew that if there was a population of people that didn't have work they were going to have other problems\nExactly right but the point is you're you're you're living in the economy you're you're not just saying and thinking it's good because people are telling you you're actually experiencing it well\nI Am experiencing it and I feel blessed and I feel grateful to the president because you know people want to act like oh well he was just given money well lots of people win money on lottery and it's gone a year later oh hey real skill\nOh that's a whole nother you're absolutely right that is a whole other subject watery lottery winners in what becomes of um [noise]\nYou're absolutely right I just I'm Glad to hear you say you're living it you're experiencing it but it's real did you that it's not just the result of me or people like me telling you that things are good that matters\nJust one thing my mom also told me Christine\nTo eat everything on my plate because there were people starving in China but I was a smart ass I was a smart alec and I turned I tried to use logic on every example of parental discipline I could so when my mom\nSaid that to me after a number of times and I got tired of hearing I said mom you telling me that if I eat everything on my plate a bunch of people in China are going to be rubbing their
