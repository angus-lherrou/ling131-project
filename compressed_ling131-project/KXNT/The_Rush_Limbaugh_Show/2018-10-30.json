give you some facts on the ground forty ... oh yeah we're going to get to the birthright citizenship isn't just a second here but I Want to set it up with this 'cause man this is great what Trump is doing on birth for you this is exactly why Trump was elected\nAs my good friend McCarthy any recording said you got to have somebody that's willing to break the furniture\nYou have to have somebody willing to turn things upside down if you're actually going to get things done and the left is beside itself the day the NBC is headlined Trump\nTrump's attack on birthright citizenship is just the latest attempt to rile up the GOP based everybody's saying he can't do that that's the fourteenth amendment he can't universe away with an\nExecutive order reverse the fourteenth the men do we want to discuss how maybe he can he's gonna run into activist judges that'll that'll turned him down here but the point is\nThat you need somebody like Donald Trump this all the fourteenth amendment is what grants citizenship to anybody born in America and it was intended it goes back to the Eighteen hundreds it was intended to grant\nCitizenship to slaves and their descendants\nHow ... how do you think modern African Americans they would feel if the fourteenth amendment which was used to grant citizenship to the slaves and their descendants he's now being used a grant citizenship to anybody that

win the Senate there isn't any blue wave I'm Talking about unreality not in terms of media lingo they'll call it whatever they want\nIf they emerge victorious\nBut all of these events were designed to cause this blue wave weren't designed to create this massive voter intensity and it turned out by Democrats and even now in the early voting Republican turnout is much larger than democratic turnout unheralded that's unprecedented\nRepublicans seldom show up this while in early voting it's hard to explain it away but the conclusion is it there has been no blue way if there is not even been a blue ripple that you might even say there hasn't been a blue drip\nSome blue bubbles are bursting recall the blue bubbles are areas of blue support last time blue congressional districts and major coastal

to not get lazy and overconfidence don't\nDon't be dispirited by any of that you hear the evidence that there is no blue wave is the is the\nEvidence of panic\nThat is prevalent throughout the drive by media because their efforts to derail Trump\nHave failed every one of them including the big one\nForcing Trump out of office because he supposedly loaded with the Russians Robert Mueller was supposed to have it delivered to go to the special counsel buying up all was supposed to have core Trump\nTrump was supposed to be on the way out by now do not\nDoubt me that's what everybody on the

where\nThe changing premise of education for America's kids actually began but I'm getting a little bit ahead of myself here in the details of the story Donald Trump\nAnd let me just give you the New York times version they're headline Trump claims he can defy constitution and end the birthright citizenship\nPresident Trump offered a dramatic if legally dubious promise in a new interviewed ... unilaterally and birthright citizenship ratcheting up his hard line immigration rhetoric with a weeks ago before the critical mid term elections\nTrump's vow to\nEnter the right to citizenship for children of non citizens alum authorized immigrants born in America\nCame in an interview with act CEOs released yesterday Trump did not say when he would sign the order and some of his past promises using executive action of gone unfulfilled but whether he follows through on his threat or not the issue and joins a string of actions intended to thrust the matter\nOf immigration ended the front of voters' minds as they have the polls next week folks as I said throughout the first year of Trump's presidency this is what pushing back looks like it was never going to be clean and it was never going to be quiet\nPushing back against the liberal order of the day was always going to be noisy and it was going to be potentially violent and dangerous\nAfter all these are people who do not accept election results anymore\nAnd you know what that means you into this country together all of these years is the honoring about actual results yeah have a heated campaign you're may have political parties and elements that really don't like each other but whoever won the election decided who\nHad a chance at running the country and both sides acknowledge that and it wasn't that long ago\nYou can go back to two thousand two when the Democrats lost those mid term elections and a shock George W Bush's first midterm elections after winning in two thousand a drive by is on the left what convinced that they were going to sweep the house the way they were going to sweep the Senate away with people were fed up with the Florida recount remember all that\nAl Gore got jobs the Democrats got cheated and Democrats were loaded for bear out what happened the Republicans won an avid seats in an off year election\nWhat the Democrats they accepted it for the most part and they started

because exit poll showed that values were a large factor in why people voted Republican well fast forward it two thousand sixteen there is no knowledge with the Trump won they do not accept\nThe election results that's what these past two years have been about and are going to remain about they don't accept Trump's election as legitimate because they didn't want it\nWe've gotten to a point where the radical left simply because it doesn't feel good about this is willing to overthrow an election results and the way this happened\nTop levels of the Obama the O. J. we're used to overthrow\nRun a silent cool to try to throw Donald Trump back out of office and reverse those election results it's unprecedented\nPat Buchanan has peace out today that uh reminds people Nineteen sixty eight featured\nEven more violence on the rats that we have yet seen this year but we're getting close\nYou can always go back in time and find a period where it was worse than it is at present you could always go back inside the civil war but if he is\nA seminal moment when a political party as its official position refuses to accept election results\nAnd that's where we are and that's why we're where we are they refused to accept it for whatever reason they hate Trump I don't feel good about it they just rip whatever doesn't matter why just the fact that they refused to accept the results\nIs a horribly dangerous thing because what if it keeps up what if the only time there is peace in America is when they win elections\nYou know I I predict it some time ago that they're going to figure this out at some point and the natural conclusion to figuring this out is well let's just eliminate elections have elections or what's holding us back let's find a way that will lemonade him\nPeople laugh and combine Ross it's never going to have to do not ever say the left isn't capable of anything ever\nSo now Trump rather than being intimidated by their refusal to accept this election or rather the feelings hurt Trump doubles down triples down every time they hit him he hits back with additional\nEnergy and verve and I'm telling you this promise with an executive order to and birthright citizenship is huge\nAnd it's why he was elected when\nThings are going terribly wrong and they are in our country right now when things are terribly wrong an out of control\nYou have to have somebody willing to go outside and the so called boundaries in Trump's doing it every day and willing to do so because this is what pushing back\nThis is what defiance this is what changing the leftist do it looks like it was never going to be pretty it was never going to be why it was never going to be clean\n\nIt requires a strong stomach and strong fortitude and there's I don't think any elected Republican other than Trump even if they had made the promises Trump made I think all of them would have caved by now\nBut Trump hasn't he doubles down All right I'm just I'm a physician executive order I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the on the fourteenth amendment Allen begins\nAll persons now the forest\nThe border I'm going to end the birthright citizenship let me read the on the fourteenth amendment Allen begins all persons not the fourteenth\nAmendment goes back to Eighteen ...

amendment why not take it to the Supreme Court or is that where this is going to end up actually show that they can decide oh it'll be their language says it'll get there and I'll get there okay yeah\nIt'll have to get there that now Senator Graham is going to offer legislation to the Senate ah look we're way way far away from this we're just getting the conversation started here which has to happen\nThere there there needs to be a pretty big re education of the American population in general on the whole subject of immigration\nAnd so Trump and his uh roots of an executive order is good but there's the you know there's going to be a judge\nThat's going to bring it to a screeching halt everybody knows that\nI mean that'll happen within hours of Trump signing the executive order everybody involved you know is that is going to happen that then begins the process and it probably will end up at this report unless Congress does right legislation but in dealing with a constitutional amendment\nOr it may take more than just the statutory act\nAnd the left and they've got plenty of judges\nUh it may take more than just the statutory act\nAnd the left\nAnd they've got plenty of judges out there are going to be using every damn one of them to try to shut\nDown every effort here let's see this is how folks this is how we end up having a chance to win by shining the light on the left in who they are and what they do by forcing them out of the shadows and making them do it\nSanctuary cities isn't good educational tool people can find exactly what these people on the left of the people responsible for this the people that are believing in the sanctuary cities or somehow make 'em defend it make a run for office ... stalling the virtues of science race to make the left\nSpeak make them behave make them stand up and support what it is they believed him\nAnd so this conversation starter on the fourteenth amendment and ending birth writes it made them stand up and make polo sea and Schumer and whoever else saw them make the case that in\nA buddy born in the United states should be able to make them make the case\nThat's how we're going to defeat him folks\nAnd it's going to be a long process don't fit the left has gotten away for years by being able to lie and camouflage themselves and make themselves look like people they aren't and make themselves look like they support things they don't\nThey hadn't been anybody like Trump and elected Republican politics forcing the left out this way and as it happens the media\nGoes more and more bonkers because they know what's going on\n\nAnd it's it's forcing everybody to see that the media isn't the media the media is the Democratic party\nAnd all of these things are why the people I talked to who think that there's not going to be a blue wave thinking they think\nMore and more Americans because of Trump are finally the liberalism and action as opposed to having been told what liberalism is and who liberals are there now see it yet\nAnd once that happens it's it's harder for the left to win\nI mean if they could win by being honest if they can win by being who they are they would they would have been doing that\nFor a long long time I appreciate the call bill thank you much will be back and continue\nTo fight them bus talent to succeed rush leaky I be network\nRush

know one thing I've enjoyed about watching Trump over the last two years is making decisions based on\nLogic and the reason I guess it's because he's a businessman but uh this idea of eliminating birthright citizenship makes perfect sense to me one of the things that I have not heard about though is another comment for this thing that is actually part of the Trump tax cut\nAnd none of this idea of enterprise zones we and we have\nCountries in Central America that could easily hire people to a lot of low tech manufacturing that's now being done in China by companies who are having a hard time\nWith ah the trade problems there are those companies if they wanted to relocate some of them apparently do good easily located down there and have a great workforce motivated intelligent people

they were talking about the same thing that we have\nProvide jobs and ... wait what what what what what what what are you what what are we talking about here\nWe're talking about we're talking about the same thing that we have a in this country for a uh companies they would like to locate in inner cities are poor areas they get a tax break for doing that\nThat was part of the Trump tax cut pretty smart idea I thought why not do that in the Central America they wouldn't be maybe the United nations could finally do something useful and subsidized companies who want to locate there and hire people to do that kind of work\nWhat you're talking to the caravan you'd think that what you do you stop illegal immigration\nI think it would have an effect on illegal immigration there are a lot of common sense things to do you know certainly the birthright citizenship thing going on with the help and the e verify but this is another thing that would certainly help providing jobs\nThat they

conditions\nIt's like the Republicans are never kicked Susan citizens that let our houses either and they've never taken away their Social Security and have the left promised democratic voters for fifty years that that's what Republicans were going to do now they're doing it with preexisting conditions you're right\nThere they've thrown on the air and making promises they connect Keith and they don't keep well they don't tend to\nJust promises they can't they connect Cape and they were selling something that isn't even viable because Medicare requires the private sector insurance without the private sector insurance there's no Medicare Medicaid for a great example that veterans programs\nYeah but see what what you're illustrating is is something that we've been talking about today they mallard ill education of people since well I don't know when you when I get to the Nineteen seventies early seventies late sixties but essentially\nFacts and reality had been replaced by what people feel if you feel it it is if you feel is right if you feel it and want it you're justified the facts are irrelevant the facts and in fact and gun it up\nFacts can confuse you and get your man and and and you you tune it all out and so if you feel\nThat a big bad company should deny\nMedical covers just somebody who said then you are being bad mean company and I'm not going to vote for anybody that

I got I got you know I'm On Fox News Sunday\nTwice a year during ratings month [noise] and Chris Wallace is always\nVery polite and exceedingly nice and asks me to make sure that tell you not to get mad at him for interrupting me because he doesn't he would never get a question and after ... the first one\nSo I got a note from a golf buddy who watched this past Sunday man this guy wall as you say he's a good guy but this guy is gone so far left I don't know if I don't know if I couldn't believe what you told me about him anymore\nSo I said well what happened well it clearly wasn't this\nOn Fox News Sunday Chris Wallace contrast in front page headlines from the Washington Post the day after Steve ... shots in Alexandria, Virginia by Bernie Sanders supporters with the Washington Post headlines following the capture\nOf the mail bomb mastermind\nAnd Trump's support her ... and not surprisingly the post made sure to emphasize that say aughts political views were mentioned in the headline while a guy that shot up school lease was not mentioned\nPolitically at all and it's Chris Wallace holding needs to headlines up and pointing it out the state I can line reading bombs suspect outspoken supporter of Trump\nWallace said that the headline really surprised him he expected the Washington Post headline to read something like suspect arrested\nA closer inspection of the article finds that it does not even mentioned that ... was the bombing suspect and some of the fourth paragraph instead the first three paragraphs read like a psychological profile of the guy talking about his support for Trump all stickers on his van\nBut on the other hand the headline after the ... shootings sadly congressman shot in Virginia you didn't mention his name it didn't mention his support for Bernie Sanders and the front page article did not mention um anything infected foot noted\nHis support for Sanders\nAnd it barely like one of the asterisk mentioning that the guy was highly critical of President Trump\nSo here's Chris Wallace holding up the I. V. if evidence of media bias here that he said surprised him\nLater on in the in the show adjacent Riley and the wall Street Journal was on he said if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and if you want to know why\nCharles Jason riling up in the wall Street Journal was on he said if you want to know why Trump won't give up Twitter and if you want to know why Trump won't give up social media of this is why these two headlines or why\nAnd the ... right you folks every day Donald Trump is the only Republican waving\nOr informing people about the success of his policies everyday stock market good Trump tweets everyday consumer confidence up Trump's tweets it every day what ever the economic news is or whatever the successes that his agenda his administration is having he tweets\nAnd if it weren't for him it wouldn't be out there are other than us of course here or in so called alternative media but but but the boy that is the Republican Party is not even counting the Trump administration's agenda successes Trump alone is doing it\n\nAnd that's why he's not going to give up the opportunity to do it and I hope we never does\nBut when I when I realized this that Trump is the only guy like today there are a couple of tweets Trump tweeting the a consumer confidence\nAs being in a record high and and relating it how can people be voting Democrat when this kind of great economic news has been the the news of the day for two years\nThere's all kinds of Republicans running for election and four hundred and thirty five house seats thirty five thirty six Senate seats we're\nIs I don't ... McDaniel is out there reading some things out now but where is the party in general touting itself\nAnd its achievements and you don't see it other than from Donald Trump and he's not whining about that he's unabashed ... just tweets about and ah and ... and he reached the truth out about the media\nAs they report on him and law and order distorts or what have you but there is an incredible incredible series of success stories that at any time in the past would have been\nA great help and used and assistance in running for election or reelection\nGreat news that would portray and show the Republican Party in a great light and Trump's it for the most part\nUm it really when you stop to think about it and it's such\nA one man show in many regard as such such a missed opportunity\nThe consumer confidence news I mean\nHow can that even be with all the news you see every day if you tuned into any drive by outlook\nEven reading the drudge headlines you would think we're on the verge of imploding and yet\nConsumer confidence is it an all time high well that's a reflection of how people living literally living and their and their their thoughts on the future\nAnd his role but we positive\nHow can that be if everybody's running around miserable and in various stages of Faisal is a more defeat\n\nIts it's important it's very uh being positive is a hard thing to do in any circumstance were not hardwired for it human beings are hard wired for pessimism\n\nIt's a hard thing to do in any circumstance were not hardwired for it human beings are hard wired for pessimism\nI've discussed this many times human beings have a natural tendency to defeat ism and fatalistic 'cause it's easier\nUh it leaves the victim hood which of course that's attractive 'cause it always means somebody else is to blame for what didn't happen to you or did the failures or whatever so\nIt's just a natural tendency to tend toward the negative everybody knows how and everybody does it but it takes\nDirect application you have to pause and take stock\nTo actually think positively about things I Do it all the time I'm I'm ... I get myself in the other over something and I'll I'll stop and remind myself\n... unbelievably fortunate I Am an blessed but the tendency\nIs to be overwhelmed with the things that are disappointing or depressing or angry\nAnd\nFor that reason I it it's easy to get caught up in all of the the negative is a ... and we are no doubt in the midst of a serious serious challenge for our country but it shouldn't override or neck gates\nThe real truth that we still live in America and we still have the greatest opportunity if we want to try to make the most of it and capitalize on it yeah they obstacles may be bigger and there may be more of them but it's still possible because people are doing it every day\nAnd\nI think the election needs to be looked at in a with a combination of these ways it's a positive opportunity to continue on the corrective pass that were on\nAnd it it it's just better way to live but it takes application to do it when you're bombarded constantly\nWith negative things that I must you know we all are guilty of doing that in a sense because we all want to sound appropriate warnings what's important to keep things in perspective at the same I've got to take a break I should develop this even more\n[noise] ... work ... lives here on used on Modi I Am\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand of safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right oh saves", "show_name": "The Rush Limbaugh Show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "30"}
