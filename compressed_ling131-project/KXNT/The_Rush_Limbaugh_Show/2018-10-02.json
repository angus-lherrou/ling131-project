friday that he was leaving oldest or the Senate\nHe totally by the way from is desirable it's their problem it's their issue let them handle it but now the New York times and the Washington Post the rest of the drive by claiming the White House is calling the shots\nBehind the scenes and expanding the scope of the FBI's inquiry made this point yesterday New York\nMoments ago last night and just now McConnell and\nWhat in fact let's do those first grab audio soundbite ... well let's play number three let's let's let's set this up this was yesterday\nMe on my own show\nThis has got to be stopped because it's not real\nThe Democrats are allowed to make it up as they go submit names they want the FBI to talk to investigations don't work that way FBI follows evidence leads at when they don't find anything I'm like Bob Mueller face stop\nMueller's been looking for collusion with Trump and Russia for two years in hasn't found any but he's still going and that's exactly what this is going to be\nIf somebody doesn't stand up and stop this somebody\nOn the Senate Judiciary committee needs to stand up or Mitch McConnell needs to stand up and start voucher thing for the investigation is taking place there are six separate FBI background checks of Brett Kavanaugh somebody needs to speak up for him\nSomebody needs to vouch for um somebody needs to stand up and say they have been thorough and they haven't found anything or he wouldn't be where he is now sitting on the DC circuit court of appeals but that's not happening\nWell but it is now late yesterday afternoon in the Senate floor here is the turtle\nOn top of the six per investigations of judge Kavanaugh them across the land of the supplemental investigation\nIf you listen carefully Mr President you can

support for what he did yesterday\nAmazing how that happens isn't he heard from so many people what a great thing he went out and he did it again he went out there again and he recycle the old Bill Clinton aligned to boot here's McConnell's from just a couple of hours ago\nWhen judge Kavanaugh demonstrated is widely acknowledged brilliance open minded enough and college ... promotion there are some shows a darker rode the politics of personal destruction were willfully only after the FBI shares what they found\nCenters will have the opportunity to vote will have the opportunity to vote no on the politics of personal destruction\nWill have the alternative voted yes on this far nominate that\nDoesn't even touch what he did he went out there and he he didn't call these guys up by name but he quoted\nSome of the most outrageous why is that Democrats have been telling including members of the Judiciary Committee he pointed out their hypocrisy he pointed out their prevail occasions he pointed out their straight up in up lies it was so good that it forced chunky was Schumer to go to the Florida we bought it\nAnd choke you went out there and tried to make chicken salad and when it was it was it was incredible listening to truck you\nI Believe Chris ... she was eminently credible judge Kavanaugh is not it's the other way around we have a life time of investigation of Brett Kavanaugh folks\nThere have been six now seven FBI investigations background checks\nWe have had more people looking into every ... bread Kevin O's life and we haven't even began to look at hers\n\nWere just assuming she's credible because that's the Democrats position on this\nThat they can go back and they can look at anything Kevin ... done but she is off limits for something we can go and find out what she did it all over the beach parties we can't go out and find out what she did was she was out there skiing\nAnd surfing and flying around and do we [laughter] none of that's

like\nThere was a part of me that thinks that he was in on this from the get go I there's a part of me thinks that he was not scared to death when he got harassed and protests that an elevator there's part of me thinks he because he hates Trump and that's what all this really\nIs all of this is aimed at people eating trumpet Kavanaugh's away in order to get Trump they gotta get Kevin on the lake is out there so you know what\nI um I I Kevin lost two part is with me I don't think we need to wait a minute you said you were going to vote for him friday morning flights\nAnd then you did\nSlate voted for Capitol after claiming was going to vote for him now he's on these two partners in for me I I don't know I don't want that on the court I don't think we can do that\nFlake is demonstrating that his name is actually an apt to er an apt description\nPersonality and now here's Feinstein he wanted to wait\nEverybody agreed to all week and it was predicted by me and many others within\nHours of agreeing to one week the Democrats not long enough and here's die if I take this from the topic again senator di fire what a floor vote friday beat to ...\nI Believe it is I Believe that students It's Tuesday and um we used to put all the facts together yeah we have and this is a I guess that's my tense Supreme Court hearing that I sat on and there's never been one like this with the issue

minute I thought the investigation was to look into what's her face ball the Ford maybe Ramirez entered the outside sweat Nick and they're all being looked into and there's nothing there\nAnd so on friday at all it's way too soon besides we got to look into reproductive health because you know Brett Kavanaugh wants women to die\nAnd bread cabinet doesn't Brett Kavanaugh that that's why I say somebody has got to stand up and stop this shut it down because it isn't going to stop it is never going to be time to vote it's never going to be time to end the investigation is never going to be
