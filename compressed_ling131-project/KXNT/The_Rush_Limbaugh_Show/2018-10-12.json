to remember about well thank you [laughter] I'm calling I wanted to talk about what's left\nIs doing with their intolerance and how that relates to the Saudi journalist ...\nOh yeah but I first of all the mentioned just ironically didn't want us to talk about I happen to be a clinical psychologist in private practice and I am not ...\nYou know people coming into the office falling apart because of Trump it's just not really happening sometimes it gets mentioned in passing but but um it's not really happening and when people mention anything that triggers a stress response\nIt really isn't the the stress or that's the problem it's helping people to manage their own ability to deal with stress because they could they could have problems with any issue money or relationships or something else it's really helped me to get stronger to eat\nOr to build some palaces and to not to do so Chris soon to be a little more open minded I'm ... I'm not seeing with with some of those people are saying\nWell now wait a minute now are you suggesting that the story is in the political that's the equivalent\nOf something as big and widespread Washington Post number you suggesting that the story is exaggerated and not that many people are suffering from this ah trumped arrangements syndrome or whatever\nI can tell you that I have an extremely busy practice and it's not happening because Trump get mentioned in passing yes so didn't George Bush so they will go rock Obama but usually they were not ... they're member\nYeah but what is your office was on the Upper West side or what if your office was in Georgetown\nOr you know in Hollywood I won't ... boulevard what its whopping just falls is not I mean you've got basically when Jimmy Stewart up there right\n[laughter] well I'm sixty miles from New York City so it's not too bad\nWell that's that's far enough away I mean that's the way the often just falls not Manhattan for a reason\n[noise] well if someone came to me and they were really really upset about Trump my goal will be to try to help them manage that so they don't they don't fall apart because Trump is not the issue ... they'd be the issue is rarely the trigger unless it's unless it's human\nBut she your being responsible I think the psychiatrist these people are going to see are suffering from the same things I don't really shrinks know how to help them I think the drinks are probably encouraging\nThem that they're justified in feeling this way that Trump is enough of a rubber ... they make anybody feel this way and that's normal\nI can tell you one thing that I'm I'm right of center and I'm In the minority in psychological and psychiatric field\nOh yeah Oh absolutely\nSo that that that bias does bring in if someone is very much a progressive or liberal um they will certainly be affected by what's going on okay\nLet me ask you this I'm a you may not be able to tell me this because of a a patient client or a confidentiality I'm not asking the names but what what percentage of the people\nWho are coming to see you for help are in fact out of kilter big cause of politics not maybe Trump per se or any other personality but just politics in general how many of them are in a state of confusion or stress just because of politics\nAnd I'd say zero percent zero percent yup me real person then that's it because you know they're not coming in\nIt's supposed to do they're worried about you know their families are they're going through a divorce or they have anxiety or depression about other things or they were traumatized [noise] um\nLet's see two liberals all of that is Trump spoiled [laughter] 'cause he got elected and he's president it's all his fault\n[noise] that you know it's it's interesting one of the things that helped me you're right was psychology when I was running it because um when people come into my office and that sort of have terrible child\nAnd and maybe it's legit they were really mistreat it they were view I can sympathize with an enterprise and say that was horrible now we have to do the work of getting past it and continuing to belong or doesn't help\nAnd having the attitude that somebody else must change in order for me to feel better is backwards we have to be willing\nTo thank you you have just defined liberal as you got that is perfect everybody else must change in order for these people to feel normal in God that's exactly it they force everybody to become what they demand\nAnd toll love it at the same time\nAh that's I'm Glad you

even though Trump\nWas initially very hard on Saudi Arabia claiming if this\nHappened and if it was proven this is very very bad we're not gonna look me in a way well here's the development of and this was this [noise] this is one of the things I shoot myself I should figure for not having predicted this yesterday when I told you the story [noise]\nWe have a tweet here from a guy named Daniel Klaidman now he's the editor in chief in\nYahoo Yahoo News here's his tweets a close friend of Washington Post columnist Jamal ... tells Michael it's a cough and me that the Saudi\nCrown prince Mohammed bin ... may have felt emboldened in parentheses to murder the journalist\nBy Trump's anti media rhetoric Trump hates journalists and he would not react if we kill one journalist says colleague indeed some jewelry and so now with ... have\nFought to have been murdered and dismembered and by the way they think now that he's been buried in a plot of grass\nIn the console the back yard and the console is not leaving when the consulate there Turkish officials cannot get in and search or dig up you know the old diplomatic immunity thing\nAnd they announced this at a time\nWhere the media was telling us that we were on the verge of running out of fossil fuel and that the supply of fossil fuels was finite\nAnd we were going to have to do something real fast because we're losing fossil you'd have to start conserving and fossil fuels it's a good thing anyway because they caused climate change and so forth and I asked myself why would Gulf Stream I happen to know the c._e._o. at the time\nI said why are you guys doing this if you how you're going to power this Jackie how are you there if there isn't going to be any kerosene refine which is jet fuel jet a if you're not going to have enough jet fuel for anybody who buys this plane to fly it why are you going to make it\nSo well what you're hearing isn't true we routinely study the fuel markets ... you're right Mr Limbaugh as you always are there's no way that we would design introduced manufacture a brand new jet\nIf there isn't going to be ample supply of fuel for it\nAnd he said by the way we are not the only people to make jets there continue to make new ones everybody I Know in a jet business said the gulfstream CEO is designing and building new ones in fact Mr Limbaugh you can look around we'll find some people actually trying to redesign supersonic travel\nInto Concord ride I said well how can this be if we're hearing that there's a finite supply of fossil fuel and it you're not going to get enough for anybody to be able to fuel one of these planes flying anywhere he said well it just simply isn't true\nSo I once again realized listen to the people who are making financial investments\nIn their products and then their businesses designed to grow the business and sell them why would they start making new airplanes if there isn't going to be any fuel why would they build
