list as well\nAnd they were talking about recent shootings and mailed pipe bombs and free no said the lemon remembers another hate filled criminal just last week Kentucky let a white guy in custody for shooting and killing two African Americans in a grocery store\nAnd you know we barely had time to work very hard time to cover\nWe have to stop demonizing people and realized the biggest terror threats in this country is white man most have been radicalized to the right and we have to start doing something about them there is no travel ban on them you know they have a Muslim ban there is no white guy bands\nWell there you habits are my friends very very non dilemma and um we need a white guy ban not to go along with the travel ban andme a Muslim ban because the biggest terror threat in this country right now is white\nMan\nThe travel ban andme a Muslim ban because the biggest terror threat in this country right now is white\nMen this of course ignores\nAll of the people of color protests marches antifa who\nInflict damage and harm on people of course the black lives matter\nA group but you see a\nWhat's interesting about this are noteworthy founded is this is what is really thought of non lemons not alone here he just happened to be the guy that set it\nYou mean Don like the followers of black lives matter are the Republicans in that group looking number of police officers have been murdered Mr lemon by black lives matter supporters and look at how many of those cops murders have been defended\nAnd explained away by people like you\nBeen defended and explained away\nBy people like you\nIn the sense well they're cops and they mistreat and they are racist they deserve it\nBut don't try to tell me that Democrats are killing people yeah how about the guy that shut up the Republican baseball practice I think he was intending to wound to people Steve ... is almost did die it's amazing these people the way they talk and the things they conveniently forget or don't even register maybe in the first place\n\nFive cops in Dallas two thousand six team\nOr the Muslims in this country who have committed murder or are they Republicans nope many of them are very loyal Democrat voting bloc\nMuslim Americans in fact maybe and even more reliable Democrat vote than black voters\n\nAccording to Forbes magazine of the three thousand three hundred and forty two people killed by terrorists than the U.S between Nineteen Ninety two in two thousand Seventeen Islamic terrorists are responsible for Ninety two percent of those murders and yeah Don Lemon on CNN says the problem\nIs white men we need a white\nMen than there is no white guy ban\nBut you know one must ever blame the left no one must ever blame the news media ... all one must ever blame the rest of the Democratic party for any of the attacks done by their rabbits like Occupy Wall street like black lives matter like antifa\nThe truth is it isn't Republicans running around doing these things\nIs is a bunch of deranged people who are out of their minds and I'm telling you\nIt can happen\nTo among the most feeble if there's just a steady diet of the negative upon negative drumbeat on television today that is described as news it is not news\nIt is the Democrat Party agenda but it is not news it hasn't been news for quite\nAwhile audio soundbite number for David Robin gr gonna last night on CNN\nAnderson Cooper three sixty of the program a question the Senate gotten killer was motivated by anti Semitism but also this obsession and the caravan in the invaders echoing language the president himself used it doesn't seem like the president's step back from that if anything a residence pushing the gas pedal down further\nOr what is not mentioned here at the synagogue shooter have at Trump considered drop a sellout\nPrecisely because he has a daughter that converted to Judaism that's not mentioned not Trump is ratcheting down his visa had been pedaled through the metal and here's the opinion of David ...\nWe ought to go back and think about you know how Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma say I'm Nineteen Ninety five\nAnd ... he doesn't go after the terrorists he doesn't sort of make us you know beat the drums or to go out and and stock the terrorists all around the country tried to heal and it was a turning point as president say he was embattled when he went to Oklahoma City that turns his presence around with a very positive direction\nThis is how history revision has works\nThere David ... saying that Bill Clinton went to Oklahoma City in Nineteen Ninety five inhaled he didn't go after\nThe terrorists\nHe didn't sort of America you know beat the drums to go out and stop the terrorists\nWell\nGo back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety\nWell let's go back and listen to what Gergen thanks was Bill Clinton's finest moment April twenty fourth Nineteen Ninety five in Minneapolis\nWe hear so many loud and angry voices in America today whose sole goal seems to be to try to keep some people as paranoid as possible and the rest of us all torn up an upset with each other\nThey spread hey they leave the impression that\nBy their very words that violence is acceptable you oughta see I'm sure you're announcing the reports of some things that are regularly said over the airwaves in America today it is time we all stood up and spoke against that kind of reckless speech\nRight now who could have been talking about this Nineteen Ninety five there is no Fox News the block with her as a result of the airwaves\nOr this is where he attempted to blame me everybody you know what at the time and it was even applauded by some not everybody\nAt the White House felt some have they have the issue of corrections and all we were talking about the Michigan Militia short wave radio network that's the way it meant by angry voices on the right\nThe Michigan Militia was a media creation I mean there might have been some guys hiking around in the woods with some guns were in Campbell gear and the media had video of it but the Michigan Militia was a non factor in any of this you get right up but there's Clinton's zeroing in on it when it's attempt to blame me\nBombed out somebody you think Clinton you didn't do that no he was trying to heal he didn't go after anybody he didn't go after the terrorist he didn't sort of beat the drums in stark jealous of all of them he tried to heal it was a tournament this is\nAgain history revision is an extraordinary one more bite this is Wolf Blitzer asked\nAnd judge Jeffrey Cuban\nLast night on a Wolf Blitzer show on CNN\nI with the White House correspondent proceeding in Nineteen Ninety five are in the aftermath of the Oklahoma City bombing or Clinton was president and he went to Oklahoma City was he delivered a beautiful speech who was very very warmly received there were no protesters going on for you remember those days\nAnd how about you know President Obama who unfortunately had all these mass shootings on his watch in South Carolina in Connecticut and you know he led the grieving and all those places frankly wouldn't even occur to me that there would have been protests see\nSo now there were no protests for a bomb in there is no protests when Clinton went out but there's all kinds of protests when Trump goes out meaning what\nThat Trump's guilty But Trump's at fault it's the protestors are right why weren't there any protests back in those days we'll take a look at who the victims were number one but what why we're there no protests\n\nPrecisely because the left very rarely protest its own people they protest for no reason at all other than a simple excuse for it\nBut it also was a different time we're talking about it over twenty five years ago twenty two twenty three years ago and it it it was a much quieter and different time it was just\nGetting ratcheted up to where we're headed in any way I

doesn't matter and then they said that Kavanaugh situation that Democrats blew that sky high and sort of home and this was really going to help them then the pipe bomb in the Senate guy shouldn't come along and they feel like their motivation or\nPeople need to be reminded let's pretend that some of the momentum was lost located we got plenty of time\nWe got the E R B network got all kinds of ways to remind people what happened to Brett Kavanaugh who did it what its purpose was and the proof that it was a series of lies and made up charges as evidenced by the fact that now there's not a single story about it\nBecause of the media lost the Democrats lost\nThere's not a single story about it because the media lost the Democrats lost\nIn their effort to destroy Kevin ... they lost in their attempt to use Kavanaugh they're hurt Democrat hurt Republicans in the in the mid term elections\n\nHere's another one if the camera no confirmation circus\nWe're about justice for his alleged victims the women instead of about killing his nomination by any means we'd still be getting updates on the story when we I mean if it was really the purpose about getting\nJustice if it was to make sure that these women that were sold on the line and so abused in Seoul raped by Kevin ... is the point of all that wants to get justice for them then why is justice not being sought any longer\nAnd the answer to the question is it was never about the women\nBecause none of the women had any evidence it was about one thing only and that was killing the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh even if it meant destroying his family and his career his future and his life\nAnd they failed so now it's on to whatever is next and I guess it's we need a ban on white guys from Don Lemon\nThe real murderers in America the real problem is white men we've got a Muslim ban we've got this bad we don't have a ban on white guys and we need a ban on white guys white men have now become the primary issue in America according to the left\nAs ... by John Lennon\nSo we're we're just drive by mania where given everything we got on Capitol but now drop it and move on to their things now Trump responsible for pipe bombs now Trump responsible for sent a guy should Trump responds more Trump responsible for the airplane crash next week when they got around to that\nNone of it is real\nNone of the news is real it's all manufactured so what does it mean what does it mean that we're not getting any updates from the drive by media about all of these women were so mistreated by Kavanaugh\nWhat does it mean that the Democrats are not being asked by the media whether they support Kavanaugh's impeachment why is this all been dropped\n\nWhy have the media given up investigating the story they obsessed over for nearly a month\nFor weeks September and October that's all the media talked about [noise] where's the follow up\nIf Kavanaugh was as they say that story should not have gone away the women still suffered the women did not get justice cabinet got confirmed where is the news where is the continuing investigation will it doesn't exist because it was all made up about capital\nClassic Democratic Party media operation\nSo is the aftermath of the pipe bomb story and so as the aftermath of the Jewish synagogues story it's all media manufactured not the stories themselves in this case but the

the way we're checking people's health\nThey were determining whether or not people actually wanted to be Americans it was a restrictive process\nNow we were a much newer and younger country them and we had an entirely different attitude about immigration and growth and it was required that immigrants assimilate and it was required that they be healthy we we're not going to open the borders to illness\nWe we're not going to expose the American people to things through accidents\nOr or design but more importantly the immigrants who were allowed in had to demonstrate that they wanted to be Americans they had to demonstrate that they love America\nIt wasn't enough to be fleeing war it wasn't enough to be fleeing discomfort it wasn't enough to be fleeing poverty you had to want to be an American\nYou had to learn about American history you have to promise that you're going to do your best to learn the English language if it was restricted because it was predicated and based on the fact that we weren't in charge of who was going to live here\nThe world was not in title was entirely different vantage it back then but even then I read books I remember conversations with my grandfather who lived to be a hundred and four he was born in Eighteen nineties\nHis life\nSpan and pre electricity to going to the moon in his life he saw all of that he grew up on a farm had to go plow fields before school every day\nCome home after school work the farm and so forth and like all the stories everything they didn't sell is what they got to eat\nUm he was one of the first in his wedding of the first to ah to go to college became a lawyer\nBut he\nFrom the horse and buggy days and nights\nUh to go to college it became a lawyer\nBut he\nCame from the horse and buggy days and no electricity to\nManned space flight landing on the motives bottle\nAnd I remember I was I was home in Missouri I guess Nineteen Ninety two years after the program against as they Nineteen Ninety\nAnd he is around Ninety these these uh ... close to a hundred years old and he's asking me so what what are the big things it was hard of hearing but it's not just couldn't\nHere to radio easily so one of the big things being discussed on your program say immigration we call the pop pop you would not\nBelieve it I mean I I I'm dealing with people who are just so anti immigration wouldn't run\nThis was this was folks this was all in\nBack in Nineteen Ninety it wasn't just strictly southern border immigration and he said you know I remember those debates all the way back in the early Nineteen hundreds back in the days of Ellis Island you immigration has been\nA\nPolarizing subject to this country for as long as we have been doing it and he started telling me stories of the\nUh efforts to him a ... new arrivals from western in Eastern Europe\nAnd he was telling me that there were so many people who didn't want any of those people from Eastern Europe Western Europe average people as his point was the arguments haven't changed the issue has been something that is Constance\nBut the one thing that has changed he was talking about even back in Nineteen Ninety\nWhen we were talking about he was talking about legal immigration he was saying but back in the early Nineteen hundreds away they've you know the controversy then was about legal immigration and even with legal immigration there were people opposed to opening up Ellis Island then preventing masses of humanity that come in\nAnd for reasons similar to what our stuff today the differentiating thing today is that the legal immigration is seldom even discussed and we have both\nPolitical parties in predominantly one of them now advocating for lawlessness advocating for illegal immigration and then using opponents of illegal immigration as examples of racism and bigotry so forth so while the issue has always been around and it's always been a controversial\nThing immigration and how we manage it\nThe idea that illegal aliens should be automatically granted citizenship for amnesty upon their arrival that is what's new to this debate and that is what the ah the Democrats in the American\nLeft today are are advocating and they're doing ... on the premise that America is responsible for the\nEconomic plight of these people that we\nAs a superpower have taken an unfair portion of the world's resources we've gone around the world and take and what we want and we have not compensated people privately we've tried to impose our way of life and so\nIt liberalism economics is a zero sum game if the American people are wealthy than somebody has to be poor out there\nAnd so therefore the American people are guilty of something there was an unequal\nDistribution of wealth the laps as in all of these countries in Central America and South America so\nYesterday or something there was an unequal distribution of wealth the laps as in all of these countries in Central America South America so poor compared to us\nAnd it's not a coincidence got to be our fault somehow so it's only fair that these people are fleeing a rotten economy is in war torn strife\nThat the United states allow them in as a means of apology\nAnd it becomes a definition of compassion\nAnd the real purpose behind it is to transform America and to kind of nation it was never intended are found it to be\nAnd that's the difference is legal and illegal immigration subject has been around it's been controversial for as long as it has been happening but the idea that illegal immigrants have a legal claim on whatever they want in this country that's\nThat is what's new and the education they make so many young people think that that's what just thing\nIs also relatively new [noise]\nThe most powerful million been

what's on the news they have things going on in their lives at take much more important to them have much more relevant so there's a lot of people are casual observers\nAnd they believe pretty much everything they see or hear but I'm telling you it's a good question it's just it's it to me it has been frustrating and no end as a practitioner of the spoken word how people believe if they read it no matter where it's published if it's on paper it's on a computer screen they believe it\nFayette my off and on college Hawaii\nWhich who would say it more often and call it for what it is\nI mean anyone hell any reporting and like I found that out ladder and if you call it that was the head\nIdaho any reporting and like I found that out ladder and if you call it what did you have to ask about comic\nI'll look there's a lot of factors that go into this uh believe me Kate I have studied this for for example let's talk about branding have you ever wondered why I'm sure you've seen evidence of it just the word Republican is mentioned by a comedian or by anybody and the audience there starts laughing\nOr or booming or what have you well it it doesn't matter what follows all the ... the word Republican triggered a bunch of boring in laughter among a certain people in an audience\nThat's branding that'd be the Republicans have a branding problem in addition to other than the Democrats have their own version of branding problems with the well how do you overcome that\nHow do you overcome a bunch of people who've grown up\nAnd been taught that Republicans hate X Y and Z and oppose X Y and Z how do you deal with that how do you you're you're dealing you you think people being stupid or blindly obedient or whatever\nThey don't they think they're very smart they think they're really up to speed they know that Republicans or whatever\nAnd this is the Democrats have had a this is one of the powers of the media to brand Republicans as racist sexist begets and so forth [noise] they've been doing this for fifty some odd years\nAnd it's it's asking a lot for consumers to to do this trust this I've been doing it for Thirty years to get people to trust that I've been asking for Thirty years to people to understand what liberalism is why you should immediately distrust\nWherever you hear it or see it\nIt's a long arduous process but the question of why why not why are people gullible or\nIt's easy number one path of least resistance believe what somebody tells you accept\nYour spouse have you ever noticed your spouse is the person you distrust of the most\n[laughter]\nSee [laughter] you know my point is there are certain things or spouse cannot tell the other spouse that a third party has to do it\nI Would like I think that if I I I but I Do for a while [noise] ah\nWell hang on just like you don't [laughter]\nI'm okay I did not fall I'm cool my watch thanks I just felt\nIt does this thank you thank you very much appreciate it it's a good question it's a frustrating answer you know why are people gullible you realize how many American businesses rely on\nThe gal ability of consumers how many ... if you hear if you hear somebody if you watch it on the news that caffeine promotes heart attack in people over fifty why do you believe that well you believe\nFor a lot of reasons people over fifty are prone to heart attacks why would they lie about what's what would possibly be political about that and they think science is infallible science doesn't lie scientists trying to save lives so people end up thinking of caffeine\nHabit over fifty you're going to more more like they have a heart attack or not and this stuff gets started in ... that they're old wives' tales and then eventually they're disapproved\nBy people believe or how many people believed you know one of the biggest one of the most successful Mitt ever propagated by the French wine industry that red wine every day with cheese willow lemonade heart disease\nHow many have you heard that growing up having a glass of red wine\nThat red wine every day with cheese willow lemonade heart disease\nHow many have you heard that growing up I have a glass of red wine every day maybe even two\nAnd they view expressed in it just what have you ever seen a French person they don't exist and you know they don't die of heart attacks either and all they're doing is drinking wine agencies white wine red wine and break oh yeah you're right\nYou're right people end up believing that stuff\nUh the gal ability of people\nIt's I think rather than try to fix would change that the
