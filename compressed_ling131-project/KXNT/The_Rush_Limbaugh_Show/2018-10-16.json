Oregon who is a guy and the question\nHas the gender gap increased since Kevin the\nA lot of takes on Kavanaugh on the effect that he had are drawn by like male pundits who are in her most social\nNetworks right especially for Republicans where the Republican kind of consultant and pollster and an expert community is very male journalists are pretty male has hasn't changed that much maybe a little bit improved after the conventional wisdom about like the effects Kevin I Will have I think are governed by that\nA lot in our forecast you now see a clear split between the house in the Senate where the G ... summit chances continue to improve but the Democrats house chances actually are back on the upswing now kind of since the cabinet nomination\nA ... it's it's kind of not like it's kind of just the Kavanaugh fight has energized Republicans far more than Democrats and all of these house races the Democrats are assuring their voters are locks\nThey're too close to call right now there's a whole bunch of 'em that are too close to call this isn't in the bag for them\nBut they're voters need to be told that it is they've set that up\nThey've been on this blue wave business for so long that if they come off of that even a bit that causes a crisis of confidence among the Democrat voting base they can't do that but folks I'm telling you I'm maybe I'm even asking for your input here\nVery briefly again starting in two thousand ten rock Obama\nBeing done the destruction of the Democratic party as an electoral apparatus they lost twelve hundred seats between two thousand ten and two thousand sixteen they continue to lose seats in the two thousand sixteen race which Trump one which they bought was a walk landslide win for them\nThe last elections that approach what's coming up we're the two thousand fourteen midterms Obama one\nWell didn't even get way and it wasn't on the ballot or the the um the midterms in in that year we're not the grand sweep for Obama that they were ... they were said to be Obama presided over the systematic loss of seats by the Democratic party in two thousand sixteen comes along and Trump wins the presidency\nAnd the Democrats have the least amount of electoral power in Washington since the Nineteen twenties\nAnd from that we're supposed to believe that Donald Trump alone\nHas provided the energy and the imposition of ... wake and the Democrats the comeback show up and retake everything\nThey lost all the problem with that is the Democrats lost because Republicans won\nThe Republican voters showed up in droves in every one of those mid terms and the presidential race two thousand twelve is two thousand twelve presidential race Democrats continue to lose seats even though Obama won his reelection nobody else the Democrat Party\nDid much were bragging about\nSome of the Republicans came alive first it was the Tea Party Obamacare and all of the standing to\nEnergize but then it was Lois Lerner the IRS and all the other scandals that came along Benghazi there was nothing was Obama was doing the economy wasn't flat line if it wasn't if it wasn't deteriorating there wasn't anything Obama was giving away nuclear weapons to the Iranians\nHe was giving away guns to Mexican drug cartels in a back door way\nTo do damage to the second amendment people want to know part of what Obama was doing every chance they had to vote against it\nExcept they didn't have the guts to vote against them because of the racial component do thousand twelve so now we're supposed to believe\nThat that trend that sees the Democrats holding the fewest number of electoral seats they've ever had since two thousand in the Nineteen twenties has suddenly overwhelmingly changed simply because there's so much hatred for Donald Trump\nAnd a hatred for who Trump visits hatred for his tweets it's hatred for his personality it's hatred for his manners or lack there of hatred for the way he behaved it's hatred for his hairstyle it's hatred because it'd be mean spirited and what that\nAnd that alone is what the media and Nate Silver are telling us all girls this massive\nDemocrat blue wave\nThere is no trend that suggests Democrat blue wave plus\nTrump is you ... the Republican Party has one more Nate Silver life here from the same pod cast continued now listen\nWe're in this weird zone we're number one I remember we ever had a split in the forecast like this I mean pretty unusual to predict the likelihood of a split is unusual we're all so I always says what are in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenty zone\nIn both places that makes me nervous and remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means that like there's a forty percent chance that one of those two predictions will be wrong so you know not quite fifty fifty but we call something a toss up it's forty percent or greater is almost a toss up that you'll have one of these forecasts\nAnd I'm like this for you let me translate this\nThis guy is nervous so she can be he's sweating bullets there is a fifty fifty chance that he's wrong he's admitting he's never seen a splint like this he's talking about\nDemocrats winning the house Republicans winning the Senate\nHe's never seen anything like that you know I I don't know how to do this and we consider it a toss up at six forty percent one way or the other but I guess he's tell I guess he hasn't the slightest idea what's going to happen in this election and he's very nervous all from the fact that he can't figure out he can analyze he doesn't have the slightest idea what's\nGoing to happen here now he didn't want to come out and say it that way you need to have the talent and the expertise to experience that I have to translate these clowns\nWhen they start throwing their numbers around and their percentages and stuff but let me just go through this very quickly well you know we're in this weird zone where I don't remember we ever had a split in the forecast like that's pretty unusual ... a lot of things are on your shoulders time aren't they need\nTo be an unusual since two thousand six team hasn't it\nTo predict this likelihood of a split is unusual we um you know I always say uh when we're in the eighty twenty zone and we're now in the eighty twenties on in both places that makes me nervous\nMeaning eighty twenty Republicans keep the Senate eighty twenty Democrats when the house\nAnd makes him nervous eighty twenty that's as close to a lot of it makes me nervous we're now in the eighty twenties on on both sides of this remember there's almost no chance of Democrats win the Senate really\nThere's no chance of Democrats win the Senate but don't win the house which means it like there is a forty percent chance at one of those two British is going to be wrong [laughter]\nWell there is a pretty good indication that Democrats are not going to win the Senate and he's saying its impact we don't win the Senate ah when the how\nHe doesn't know he's nervous\nAs analysts telling if it's eighty twenty both sides but they don't know it's fifty fifty fifty fifty you might not even

point Idaho welcome great to have you here Hi\nThinks rush you walk up\nI was wanting to touch on why I think there might be a red wave instead of a blue wave and that's because for years and years we've been told that we find in the media and establishment and whoever else that we needed to go with mark and a moderate candidates like John McCain and Mitt Romney\nYeah yeah exactly right look where that got us yeah in two thousand so national guy\nIn two thousand six throughout a garden and Donald Trump come down an escalator and we were fed the same talking points of life could win and with our backs against the law on election night we all showed up to the polls for the the greater good\nRecruit the media and everybody else wrong and I believe that that gave the conservative they confidence and I think that they're going to show up and a greater force because we've been told that it has got to be able to wave and we're going to prove them wrong country and they said\nWell that's what a lot of people are hoping that there is a sophistication sophistication\nLevel among two thousand sixteen voters tells them how necessary it is to go out and vote in whatever way but we'll continue to support Trump because that's really what this is about\n...\nMaybe I'm going to do this starts tomorrow Thursday I don't know which yet but I it it's it's it's about time to go through the with the and the Republicans\nHave this was by the way they've made their own of what to expect if the Democrats win the house and if it was brutal and I don't have any doubt\nThat everything on the Republican list is true\nThey're going to every committee in the house is going to be used to investigate something Trump has done or some body image administration it is going to be unlike anything we've ever seen every day of the Trump Administration is going to be investigated and subpoenaed\nThat's all the Congress is going to be doing is investigating and indicting that's all they are going to be doing that's all that's going to happen\nThe Senate\nRepublicans hold it so legislation is going to get ... there's going to be total gridlock nothing's going to get done none of Trump's judges will get past his lips\nAfter he nominates them\nSo yeah it's going to require a lot of voters to understand this but you said conservatives the Trump coalition is not just conservatives there are a lot of Democrats have voted for Trump there are a lot of independents that voted for Trump there are a lot of moderates that voted for Trump\nThere he got he got people from every demographic spread\nAnd some of the Trump people were not ardent Trump supporters they were frustrated didn't like anybody at all and fought they would go for the biggest change they could\nBut not every Trump voter was a make America great again advocate\nSo how many of those are still happy with their votes how many of those real lives that for what they voted for her to continue Trump has to remain free of investigation I mean look what the deep statesman able to do when they don't even run the show\nThe deep state the executive branch which Trump grounds look what they've been doing
