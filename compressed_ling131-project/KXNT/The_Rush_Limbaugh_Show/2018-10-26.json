publications now and I just I just want to caution you that since this is what's being reported first impressions are now being registered by people as they hear all of this I Am reporting it to you\nUnder guidance telling you that I I just tell you what I'm finding in ah in various publications that are that are floating around\nThere has been a a mad cap and desire to id who ever was sending these bombs as a Trump supporter\nA all week long and they have not waited they are they're moving at light speed to make this association\nSuch as in this headline suspected make America great again bomber ID as Native American and Trump supporters stays are ... or say Iraq a fifty six\n[noise] so [noise]\nThere is still have this this one I'm Still trying to figure out somebody sent me this screen shot of a website that list is party is the Green Party which doesn't jibe with any of this\nI mean the Green Party would be all in on CNN the Green Party would be all in on a\nA bunch of things that are anti Trump so some of this that we are being sent and seeing doesn't make\nA whole lot of sense so we're still in the process of trying to track it all down now in the midst of this there continues to be news reported about the mid term elections and there's some other news that was\nReported the discussion about the bombs before today when people were told the identity of the bomber and showing pictures of the bombers a van\nA down in in uh in plantation Florida and one of the things that I had intended to share with you today as Chuck Todd was on the MSNBC yesterday we every audio I lifted the ban on MSNBC to report this that Chuck Todd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind the scare\nChuck Todd\nThe report this that Chuck Todd said that he was afraid the Russians were behind this scare\nChuck Todd said that he fears the Russians couldn't be responsible for the mail bomb scare that has targeted top officials in the Democratic party\nAs well as CNN and Robert De Niro quote I have this fear it could be some Russian operation out there are designed to do what's happening now and that is so all of this confusion\nChuck Todd added that we shouldn't rule out the possibility the Russians are behind this and the male bottom scare is dividing the country\nAnd that's what its purpose is this was on his show called meet the press daily\nNow I the reason that I [laughter] the Russians what is not worry about that is that here you have the moderator of meet the press\nBetween ... between these crazy right these these national strike group plants and bombs and the Russians conspiring we cannot legitimize the win in this election for the for the Republicans and I think they're going to try to throw the whole thing of the turmoil I really do\nIt so you think that as we sit here today the deep state thinks they're going to lose their not an American to win the house back Democrats in the in the deep state thing not going to win the house back not going to win the Senate back\nSo all of this is designed to create so much chaos that whatever the result is if the Democrats in the deep state laws as they can say election invalid too much was going on we can't we get our democracy can't function this way\nYou ... and you really think that the the deep state here set this guy or prevent he's part of a flag operation\nDesigned to make it look like a Trump supporters gone nuts here and have the left when in fact they orchestrated if you think that\n[noise] do you do for the FBI and CIA and the Justice Department could have been corrupted to the extent that been corrupted over the past four or five years I mean like I said rush three years ago I would've said I'm Crazy I mean I I can put nothing pass them of course when you think about what the repercussions could be for them if they don't\nI mean you're talking about some very high profile people\nBeing out a lot of trouble theoretically ... eventually the gears of justice grind slowly but you'd like to believe that actually some of these people are going to pay for what they've done\nWell wait a minute but why why isn't that happening now the Republicans round the house of representatives now why do why do they have to win it again\nIn order to conduct these investigations that Jim Jordan says are coming up\nI think Trump will have more to do with pushing it forward once these elections are over I think there are deep state people on the Republican side who helps slow roll this thing I really do\nI think Trump will be the one ram routing it once these elections are over if he gets the big win because this will be a mandate about him if they really\nSo I have to say let's discuss the you think Trump is essentially on the ballot\nIn in this election there is no wrong answer who don't don't miss don't misunderstand my tone I'm trying to learn what you think you you think that Trump is essentially on the ballot this these midterm elections in part or maybe ... close in total are a referendum on Trump\nNo doubt about it look at the effect he's having when he goes in and campaigns for people in the states that was supposed to be such trouble when the Republicans I think he's definitely I think these people on the left I think this is going to be their big moment where they finally jam it to this guy and get all their investigation started I think they think this is the beginning of the ...\nWhen you know I Will do something with it I was I was reading a a tech blogs yesterday and folks I really appreciate you indulge me talking about this it's my hobby\nNot keeping up with the blockers meant keeping up with the tech and to keep up with the tech yeah have to read the stuff and it's all written by a bunch of young millennial journalist and they have ever since election day\nTwo thousand sixth day and they haven't been in various stages of panic\nAnd I I'm a ...\nThere was a reference in one of the tech blogs to a poll showing the red wave of the blue wave was not going to happen and it was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mile to panic about it writing about you know what we all have\nIt was not nearly as big and this particular blogger was in a mile to panic about it writing about you know what we all have been thinking that what happened in two thousand sixty and was an odd confluence of events\nThat that gave us a one off results it's not really representative of America that Donald Trump\nAnd these Republicans is not who we are\nAnd then the guy says but if the Republicans hold the house of representatives and we're gonna have to come to grips with this is who we are\nAnd that we are not running the show in truth and it was it was um it was ... I wouldn't say there was panic and ended up reading the written word\nBut it's slowly dawning on some of the last two years they have lived with the belief\nThat what happened in two thousand sixteen was unusual irregular a one off that it shouldn't have happened it was an odd confluence of events of bad candidates with the\nHillary Clinton and so forth over confidence by people on the left but that um people have been waiting every day for these two years to fix this mistaken the Democrats are going to storm the ballot boxes on Tuesday\nIn November and correct dismissing now they're starting to begin to\nQuite may be this is not an oddity maybe maybe we're not the majority and it kinda dumped tales of what you're saying here do you believe for example that a\nTrump voters and Republican voters right now are actually losing momentum devote because of his mom's now\nGo rush can I share something with you here I went yeah Trump rally I went down at Trump's rally two weeks ago it was an I was in Council Bluffs right across the river and I think the uh mid America center seats for this event it was sitting like twelve thousand I'm not exaggerating there had to have been twenty five thousand people outside there in that line\nThere were more women than there were men there were ever going Americans and they were nice people but I'm telling you there were a lot of these protesters and my instinct was I Want to say something to these protesters one I got down there like me and many other people we don't want to start trouble with that and it's like we don't have the inclination to get in their faces an act like they do\nAnd so many of these Trump supporters are not the kinds of people that are wearing it on their sleeves right now they're just going to go in and phone how how could you vote against the guy is doing such wonderful things for the country\nI mean he really is and I think a lot of those people are just going to go in there and they're going to vote because they now realize that they got the momentum on their side but they're not the kinds of people that are out there wearing it on their sleeves like these crazy radical leftists are all doing\nWell it is it is a it's it's standard old conventional wisdom thinking that people voting impulses or energy or desires ebb and flow like this\nI mean the idea that uh this week of bomb scare stories can\nDampen enthusiast I I I don't I don't think that describes the average Trump voter I think the average Trump voter is immune\nTo all of that and more made I think more than the average Trump voter I I I don't think they have to be told how important the election is I don't think they have to be reminded to vote I don't think they need to be told the stakes\nAnd yet there are people that continues you got to drive turnout Russia got to tell people how important it is and I think they already know I I'm I'm\nDon't sense that there is a usual lessening of enthusiasm or gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important it is it was it's as important now\nEnthusiasm more gaming of enthusiasm based on the ebb and flow of news I think people understand how important\nIt is that was it's as important now is it wasn't to thousands sixteen and in fact it may even be more important now that Trump is in office and policies have been in that that the idea of this stuff needs to continue or maybe more important like Trump said at one of his rallies like the ... the rally in Houston\nHe was talking about how he produced he's got he's got a track record now is it\nTwo years ago on the campaign I was saying we're going to do this we're going to be great again and we're going to stop there's going to break it trade deals better but back then it was just\nWords it was just words but now two years later I produce meeting is not just words it's real now and I think from so supporters understand this I I just think they're immune to the um uh attempts\nThat are made elsewhere to the spirit them a or to somehow we get ... and so we'll see a it won't be long haired Jimmy I'm Glad you called thanks to the extent of the time will be

just the nature of the ... what\nSafe talk all safe talk what was sex talk well it\nWas a it was it was my way of illustrating absurdity by being absurd\nUm that\nOccurred back in Nineteen eighty four

you\nNot going to do something that's so safe sex a came up and it basically meant to use a condom so I thought that I Would ah demonstrate the folly\nOf this belief\nBy demonstrating safe talk and what I did was\nOver a series of days I just do it once but first I grabbed a condom and I stretched it tight and I've placed it on the microphone we have photos of this thing taking the proven this before there were ...\nBut the sound effect of the condom being placed in the microphone was a mistake them all and then after the condom was in place\nTo demonstrate safe talk I Would I asked what do you think now if I say anything that offends you that this kind of them will protect if other profanity if I start engaging activities you don't want to hear as well this condom protect\nLife sort of course it will because I Am engaging in safe talk just like they are encouraging us to the safe sex and that's that's what he was talking about and of course there were additions and a additional aspects to it as it happened it wasn't just a a one time that\nIt had a point to make so was ongoing and then then that was followed by shortly after moving to New York they famous color abortions
