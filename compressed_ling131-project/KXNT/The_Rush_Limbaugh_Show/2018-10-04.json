there's nothing new in this everything in this we knew which was eminently predictable\nThey still haven't the FBI was unable to corroborate anything any of the witnesses upset folks\nAny of the allegations that witnesses have may they haven't been able to corroborate balls the forge testimony\nThey weren't able to corroborate Ramirez they weren't able to corroborate a sweat neck they weren't able to corroborate that this is now the seventh FBI investigation into Brett Kavanaugh\nThe leftist but they didn't talk to don't you're forty and they didn't talk to Kevin ... that's right that's that's not part of the deal they testified under oath what\nMore can you help me I work do you think the FBI I really think these people going to change their stories from what they've testified under oath\nBesides that\nDr forged testimony changed anyway and in terms of the timeline of the reason the FBI didn't talk to Ford or cabin always 'cause they've talked to a cabin off or how many times from her having a years um but they testified under oath\nAnd so the the thing is no reason to talk to them they go out and talk to people they claim can corroborate what they're saying the FBI couldn't find any so I'm watching CNN too they've got CNN and Fox on it and here and it was probably ten minutes ago ten minutes for the program started and I began to um\n\nGet the impression that the Democrats think they lost it gives a little CNN report it only looks a little to me he was describing Jeff Flake Jeff Flake said this was a very thorough this is this ... this investigation is very very satisfying to me\nAnd the CNN reporter said Jeff Flake today actually sounded like a Republican\nAnd that presents a problem\nJeff Flake it sounded like a Republican they last friday he sounded like a Democrat but today he sounded like a Republican and they went to Susan Collins Susan Collins says hey you know I look at this I'm very satisfied this was a very\nAnd then they go to

pulled it themselves and they found\nThat exactly what I had been saying has come to pass the capital hearings are back firing big time on the Democrats\nAnd NPR PBS NewsHour Marist Poll out today found a big swing in public opinion among men following the hearing with at ten point increase in those saying they plan to support a Republican candidate in the upcoming midterm elections right now\nI'm so this this is happening and the only primary changer difference here has been the Kavanaugh hearings and the and the left reaction to it I've even\nSeen stories today among the never Trump or conservatives that this whole thing may actually reunite the conservative\nMovement well we will ah will see about that but clearly there is a reaction is and and it's it's it's it's root level simple\nThis is so easily understood it is\nThe worst smear campaign many people have ever seen in their lives many people you know even as Wednesday grand found out the other day there are a lot of people today that they have no idea that Hillary Clinton ran the operation to destroy women who surfaced\nSaying that her husband Bill Clinton had abused them or raped them or mistreated them or what have you\nLindsey Graham talks about what James Carville said when you drag a dollar bill through a trailer park and he got booed because the millennials in the crowd had no idea that that's who Hillary Clinton was the same token those people will not live to Robert Bork and many of them are not old enough to remember what happened to Clarence Thomas Anita Hill so this was their first and\nThat means is the worst smear campaign ever that they've seen anyone be smeared more\nCan anybody be smeared more than Brett Kavanaugh has been smeared we think that it can't get worse but the left will always make it worse Kavanaugh has been smeared\nUnlike anybody since Clarence Thomas\nBut he's been vindicated to he's been vindicated by fact she's been vindicated by evidence even vindicated by witness cooperation seven different FBI investigations he is vindicated by a life well lived when you boil\nAll this now and I think it's going to be really hard for any repair\nThe guy and in fact I don't know this but I wouldn't be surprised if some Democrats Senate Democrats\nAre privately behind the scenes are urging recalcitrant Republicans that go ahead and vote for capital as a way this has backfiring on them\n\nDon't know that it's a wild guess and only time will tell when we get to the vote but the FBI investigation that the Democrats want it appears to have provided cover for both Susan\nCollins and Jeff Flake we don't know where Murkowski is on any of this yet of course there's the red state Democrats senators that now have\nA a big decision to make so\nWe're

M. K. U. X. and tea\n[noise] an NPR reporter or just [noise] just\nTweeted that Senate Judiciary committee Democrats are filing outta Chuck Schumer is on first stone faced the meaning is they're coming out that many of their depressed or there are no expressions on their faces they're not happy and stone face their shell shocked or something or other\nNow why would that be why well did the Democrats on that committee\n\nActually believe Christine Ford did they really believe what she was saying\nI don't know how anybody could honestly\nFox without and I I'm not even being part of what I say this she can't remember where when and why the people she says we're there weren't there and yet these Democrats although we did the Democrats and that can really think that an FBI investigation of another five or six days\nWas going to somehow produced corroborating evidence that would wipe out the Kavanaugh nomination\nThey really thought that because my my thinking all along has been they've known that this nothing other than the way this is all this this man it's all they've got if they really thought\nThat this FBI investigation was going to find something that six previous investigations in countless other interviews and written questions have produced\nWell that is shocking honest to God I Know I Know I'm I'm sometimes naive but I fought this has been a scam\nFloor we all know that the president cannot lead us through this time\nWe know that his disposition only unable to restrain his impulse to divide his mockery of Dr Ford last night in Mississippi was wrong but it doesn't really surprise anyone who he is\nMr ... senator Sasse I have an alternative view and are not going to presume that you're listening but maybe somebody who knows you\nIs I Need you to consider something senators asked you and\nNumerous other say that President Trump mock Dr Ford in his rally south haven Mississippi earlier this week and then you suggested that the Trump knows what he's doing despite all the criticism he gets\nThat he is doing this it's who he is he can't help it\nJust just asked I think it's the other way round I think Trump knows exactly what he's doing I think Trump\nHas a behavioral patterns of strategic me ... it's called pacing and really briefly explaining it began in setting up what's to come next\nWhen President Trump originally spoke about Dr Ford why did he say compelling testimony reinventing he couldn't turn away from it if she's telling the truth Kavanaugh's God he's got no prayer if Kavanaugh's ally ... gone Trump said all of this and everybody so wow this is really unusual for\n... no it's not unusual Trump gets himself on record\nEvery time but in many issues he gets himself on record in the approved washing\nBut do not some of you panic\nMaybe you don't have any more but when he first started doing this light Paris climate accord so yeah yeah there may be something here we're going to look at it they don't always going to have oh no it doesn't matter you can remember countless times where the president's initial statement on an issue of seemed to dubbed tail with what the swamp things\nBut then\nA few days or are we go by him and the president's becomes who he is and he starts speaking out against it after he's put himself on the record he does this for credibility and he does it it's something called pacing\nAnd it relaxes the opposition\nIn any number of ways she's doing the same thing here with Dr Ford he knew right off the bat that she was saying things that nobody could corroborate that nobody can prove that she couldn't prove and what he did on Monday Night was not mock her\n\nHe explained it to everybody\nThe truth about her\nEverybody because of what Trump did at that rally everybody was forced to look and listen to that little riff on Dr forge shaky uncorroborated I'm provable test them on the drive by is we're never\nGonna tell the truth about Dr Ford the drive buys were not able to ignore the rally they tried not even Fox televised Trump's rally\nBut because he said what he said about her he forced the drive by its cover what he said in the process that Dr buys reported what he said and people like Ben Sasse another started giving the vapors gave me the vapor who am I got Trump is always uses horrible 'cause this is your main he's not fit\nWhat Donald Trump did recounting the absurd inconsistencies in her testimony Donald Trump calling her out on everything has been play now on all media one all day yesterday\nReporters are now asking senators and the press secretary questions about it in the press briefing yesterday\nThe fact is the drive by media did not report the inaccuracies of Dr Ford's testimony that drive by media did not report on on none of the corroborate shouldn't being possible they did not tell their audience is\nThat the foreign people forward and placed in the room with her incident happened claim they weren't there nobody knew that folks\nOther than you\nBut people don't watch the mainstream media had no idea that Dr Ford couldn't backup what she was saying the people that watch the mainstream media had no idea that the foreign witnesses foreign claims were there all deny it and don't remember being there and one of them was one of our good friends\nDrive by us we're not reporting any of that the drive by it's worth reporting what the Democrats senators I\nBelieve her she is a credible witness as far as the American people who watch only mainstream media is concerned a woman was telling the truth the head back up she had cooperation and capital\nWas guilty so Trump goes out tells the truth about her\nShe doesn't know what she doesn't know when she doesn't know where she doesn't she got home she gets it on the record the drive by half to report it and for the first time in their lives people who watch mainstream media actually heard it look at it this way think of the millions of people who had never heard the trend\nThe millions of people who had never heard\nThe truth about Dr\nChristine's Ford and her full of holes testimony think of ... million just never heard it until\nTrump went out and characterized it for everybody think of it this way I think of the thousands of voters in Missouri in Arizona\nIn Michigan and Maine and West Virginia and North Dakota Alaska who now know the truth who never would've known the truth had Trump not\n\nDetailed it for people in his rally\n\nCollins mansion Heitkamp McCaskill flake Murkowski they knew\nThat there was no corroboration they knew that there couldn't have been any truth to what she was saying by virtue of witnesses this is why Trump did it this is why Trump does what he does if we had an honest mediate millions of people would already know that Dr Ford story doesn't add up\n\nIf the media ever told the truth about this there wouldn't be any protest today are not nearly as large envelope in voluminous the people these protests thinks she's telling the God's\nTruth they think it's gospel they don't know that her story can't be backed up their media hasn't told them the Democrats senators haven't told them only Trump did some other reason why they hate it\nBut we don't have an honest meaty and sold millions of people had no idea\nOf all the holes in the Christine balls e foreign story\nNow they do and here's a little cherry on top since Trump did that and the whole media reported on it and Democrats senators and the like we're asked about it what comes three days later today's f._b._i. report saying\nNo corroboration for what Dr Ford\nSaid so Trump says that\nPeople like Ben Sasse another never Trump has go literally insane but if Trump hadn't set it nobody would know what the Trump did say it millions now do know and here comes the cherry on the top of the FBI report we couldn't find any cooperation for her story end of the week Trump was right\nDrive by media wrong Democratic senators wrong Ben Sasse wrong\n\nAnd Trump doesn't do this accidentally it's not like he's lucky and stumbled into this stuff this is Trump's strategy and it's all related to the pacing\nOf how he originally or initially eventually I should say gets to his real thoughts on any issue brief time out now back with more in a\nRush\nLimbaugh here on you talk to you again [noise]\n[noise]\nI ordered and this is

NPR poll\nHad a twelve point advantage is not two points which is statistically tied that's the margin of error\nOr in in all these other generic ballot Paul's which I think er\nI don't think the Republicans have ever lead in one of the news and the Republicans women Congress all the time so since Nineteen Ninety four anyway you people realize when the Republicans want to Ninety four was the first time in forty years that they ran or control the house\nSince then they've lost control and won control back but I ... I don't think there's ever been a generic ballot poll ever that shows the Republicans I had\nI could be wrong I doubt it I don't recall ever having seen one\nBut now we're seeing voter enthusiasm shifts\nTo the Republicans and Democrats are are losing some and believe me if this all his real at this polling game as accurate as the same stuff that Democrats are saying it's affecting them then there's this from the Atlantic now the Atlantic is a left wing publication as is most us medium\nThey headline but this story conservative women are angry about cabinet law and they think other voters aren't to\nHere's a quote in the two weeks since it claims against capital of first emerged many feminist groups have called on senators in the American\nPublic to believe women who come forward with allegations Kamala Harris the progressive Democrats centered in California captured the sediment when she questioned for during the hearing I Believe you and\nI Believe many Americans across the country\nBelieve you let the writer of this story whose name is Anna Greene said the women\nI interviewed however raises them ten the notion that people's accusation\nShould be believed on the basis of their identity alone this makes me furious because I think that's taking advantage for the worst purposes of something that's real in our culture a woman's that women are not a monolithic blocked most of us are not going to take to the streets with pitchforks and torches\nThat said there was a large large percentage of us who feel very very strongly about the way this process has played out conservative women are angry about Kavanaugh they think other voters are too\nConservative women living suburbs [noise]\nThe reason I ask that is because the Democrats claimed to have a hold on college educated suburban women\n\nThey may be losing that hold too if some of this polling data is correct let me just say this if everything were just and it isn't and I know it\nBut if everything were saying the Democrats would be destroying themselves right now as they did back in two thousand two when they did the Wellstone Mario the Democrat Party is\nIn a same world the Democrat Party is engaging in self\nImmolation right now with the treatment of Kavanaugh\nThe backing of a woman who's ... got no evidence hasn't had a you have a corroborated and thanks to Donald Trump now more Americans than ever know the truth of her story\nAnd the truth of her story is that it's full of holes\nIf Trump had and went on his ranch gone on his ran on Monday Night the dry buys would've never reported that because they had not reported\n\nThe Democrats are not the majority they did not win the Senate that when the house the advice and consent role does not give them the right to determine who goes on the court and who doesn't that's for the winters\nBut the the behavior the Democrats have engaged in here the public political murder about highly achieved brilliant guy\nWho never did anything that anybody anywhere near the way he is being described\n\nPeople bringing forth B.

[noise]\nA raise in holy hell because they want to be able to leak and\nThey don't want to report how are we supposed to read that report why\nWell the reason there's only one copy of it is so that they can't get leaked this is raw data\nAbout people folks we have gone to great lengths to explain to you what does the FBI report is it is a series of former three oh two inch\nIt's white the FBI aversion another form ten forty three oh two is simply the results of an interview with people people of interest targets non target neighbors passers by irritate or whatever and the FBI goes in talks to people\nThey've done this about Kevin ... now seven times over the course of his judicial career and when he was in the White House staff secretary to George W.

Christianity was originally confined to very small circle of people in Jerusalem and it went from a small little movement to a\nWell the world's most popular religion and it is fascinating story how that happened which she attempts to explain in the book it's called ...\nAnd\nIt's about the birther Christianity using the book of acts it's all in the book ... I mean when I say it's all there it is I mean it's not a substitute for reading the Bible but it's the book of acts it's all there\nSo he uses the book of acts and six New Testament is pistols as the introductory guide here\nTo get people who want to read the Bible butter intimidated by up to actually get started doing it so it's sort of a primer that when you're finished this book and start the Bible you'll have a head start and you'll be more likely to stay with it\nIt\nDetails the suffering and the ... the joys and the triumph of the apostles and all of the key figures in Christianity following the death and resurrection and the central Jesus Christ which\nIf the resurrection doesn't happen in Christianity does it exist and and that's one of the toughest things and make people believe how in the world that you can't physically put your arms around that\nResurrection from the dead\nBut it's a key element of Christianity it's one of the big stumbling blocks that that people have I Can't even imagine that I mean I heard I don't want to mention any names liberal talk show host really ...\nYou really believe that camp you that's why you people are not you can't really think that somebody died came back to life that's why that's why people like you're crazy\nWell\nFor Christianity to be what it is that had to happen\nAnd my brother David is a devoted to helping people believe that has happened by accepting what's in the Bible but before you can accept what's in the Bible you have to open it\nAnd so this is it look it's it's not simply a primer if its own story of has its own telling of the tail but it's designed to be sort of like an introduction\nTo the Bible into Christianity both test them it's but this focus is on the book of acts because that's where it all is\nNow don't just read the book of acts forget everything else but it's all there in the book so that's why they chose the book of acts to start this\nSo and I I again I I thank you for giving me the time to mention is it would not be a timely at any time in the next two or three days because of all the other news happening out there but again\nIt's Jesus has risen it just hit on Tuesday and
