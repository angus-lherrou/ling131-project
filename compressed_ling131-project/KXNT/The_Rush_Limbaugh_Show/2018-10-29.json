responsibility on the president that he has an obligation to try to rid us of much of this tribalism and I think what he's done 'em over the course of the last few years is helps foment this\nOh yes he says oh Trump's fault all of this is Trump spoiled and\nThe media wants to be exempted from any impact ... they they don't want to think they influence opinion and shape the outcome of elections but\nThey don't want to be held any kind of responsible for what people do the same time it seems in Congress to me here when they when they get called out\nOn this they deny it this is a montage Tom

my mother and kill us all the time but I'm I'm just really\nIt's really a nice to be able to go listen to someone and be able to get a lot of wisdom out of what they're saying and I mean no matter what people say because I was I volunteered for the Republican Party to go on at the county fair to go work their booth\nAnd I had a lady walk up to me and say did your parents pay you to be here and I said no I Want to be here because I'm\nI Want to help my country get better and tell people who to vote for and I'm just try to make California which is not good the better\nThese were adults gonna ask you that question yes there they were um it was she might have been in our forties fifties maybe she asked oh the your parents are paying you to be here I sell\nThat was kind of rude I mean here you are your do you look sixteen or do you look a little older than that\nWell I'm Fifteen I I don't know I mean I look like a teenager\nOkay so they weren't buying as soon as a teenager there and they still feel the need to insult you mildly a mirror world but I'm sure there was no you couldn't possibly have a mind of your own if you were doing what you were doing\nYes and I'm sure she wanted to say are brainwashed but she probably didn't have the guts to say that\nWhile I'm curious about something and I'm very flattered uh I'm vibe to know whether the mind flattered year that that you would want to be something super an exceptional having listen to this program why journalism\n[noise] ah well I like journalism and I want is a way maybe one day have my own organization for\nJournalism [noise] ah\nWell I like journalism and I want is a way maybe one day have my own organization for military families who have had servicemen killed in action but a journalism because\nI just I Want to get my voice out there and change because I don't like the way I mean Trump is making America great you know I Believe that but what about\nIf someone gets in office after him and then I go in there Twenty years later it's maybe going to be a huge mess because of the way America's millennials are going like my sister and I just want to be one of those who gets up there and says\nI'm done with this I Want to change it\nOr good for you are there are a lot of people a lot of parents who have kids your age and younger\nWho are really scared about the future of the country has always been the case for my whole life I have heard people say\nThroughout my life but they don't want to have kids who wouldn't dare want to bring kids into this world that some I remember hearing that when I was Fifteen myself so it's nothing really\nReally knew that I'm sensing today when people say there is a people who have kids not so much do the owners thinking about other people who have kids are really really worried about their futures because of the way the left\nHas become more radical and more anti\nThe general concepts of America it's scaring people what kinds of the country or their kids\nGoing to grow into I mean there's always going to be an American but what's that going to be are they going to be free are they going to have to conform to some of this extreme wacko left them in order to not be hassled build up their lives there's some genuine fear about is if you want to tackle that\nMore power to you and journalism needs people like you in it\nWell and I don't that's like what you're saying I don't want my kids are my younger sister to grow up in America where\nThere's just a bunch of people that don't even belong in this country hurting and citizens going around trying to do that stuff too I don't want to grow up in a country where you can't even have a gun to protect yourself or to hunt with or a a country where veterans are put behind illegals\nI mean I just I that's the one that makes me so angry as the\nWhy do you think that's happening why do you think so much attention as being lavish on uh the people you referred to as illegals coming here who are not citizens but just being a granted access to so many things given so much why do you think it's happening\nA will there's a lot of reasons for one thing Obama made it all just come hallway and you know um but I think just because they think they see what we're going to go there and nobody's going to stop us you know well maybe the military is going to stop this\nTylenol I understand why there ... why do you think there is so much a tolerance for it why do you think so many people are wandering them here and and and want to do nothing to stop them from from getting him why do you think there's so much tolerance for the illegal\nWell aspect of this\nDon't well a lot of people who are voting they don't know anything about why\n... [noise] I don't know where to stop why would they ah I don't know why the people are wanting to give away their money to them five I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken well you know America has to help\nIs there money can then five I think that they're saying oh well poor people you know their country's war stricken well\nYou know America has found there are people too they can't just give away money to these illegal and they're like well that they may bring jobs here\nHow are they bringing jobs here when they're going to go work at I mean they're going to go work in Africa for agriculture or something 'cause I Know there's a lot of illegals outlet in California and there's a lot around where I left but\nI don't know the answer is that they worked cheap number one for the people don't want the river cheap labor cheap labor is to answer the other side of it are you you're talking about people don't want to give the money the people who are behind these policies are damn wells making sure that you and others are going to give your money they're not going to be\nGiving theirs but the answer the answer to the question is\nBecause the left wants\nPower and power to them is more and more people in capable of self reliance\nMore and more people in capable of helping themselves\nAnd the best most concentrated group of people that fit that bill are a bunch of poor ill educated or uneducated people don't even speak the language\nFlooding the southern border you get 'em in their human beings we're a compassionate country they have to be fat and they have to be taken care of the Democrats want the credit for doing all that they want to get these people registering to vote as quickly as they can they looking at him purely and simply as voters\nIt's not about compassion and it's not about giving them a good life it's not about any of the things that they want you to think it is it strictly about creating let me put it this way\nRarely the Democratic party and do not doubt me on this when you when you do do research or journalism career you will find that this is the case of the Democratic party needs a permanent underclass\nOf uneducated or poorly educated people who are not capable of economics offer live because they can't speak the language\nBecause they don't have any education those are prime democratic voters\nThose are the exact kinds of people to Democrats want to build a majority around because they will be for ever grateful I eat dependence on Democrats and will constantly be voting for Democrats no matter what else happens that's\nThat's the reason behind it nobody will ever own up to it nobody will ever admit it\nBut what they are really is just on documented Democrats it's not their undocumented citizens or aliens undocumented Democrats that's their status right now and the objective is to get them documented to get them registered and to take care of them give them health care make their track here make their trip pure worth it\nBy giving them exactly what they're coming for no some of them are going to be able to take care of themselves some are going to get here and I'm going to run rings around people some in any group of people that large are going to have a wide disparity in some of them are going to be quite competent\nBut\nAre going to be the self starters and those are not that people Democrats are interested in I just really hideous I guess I guess I guess really hideous thing of Democrats what people need people\nWho are incapable of self reliance and that's not helping those people at all that is not compassionate Democrats want you to think that's all they are and they are none of it if they exist\nAnd that's not helping those people and all that is not compassion Democrats\nWant you to think that's all they are and they are none of it it's the exact about they're using\nThese people and hoping that they never amount to much they don't have much faith\nIn them anyway but they are great voters great dependent voters and nearby so that's what this is about look I'm I'm Glad you called rarely or exceptionally well spoken your home schooling is working and you're I Hope that you hope you do get into journalism is journalism needs people that that are interested in the truth\nI also want to thank you for the book the route on Iran and I've read on than they are ... has happened to my little sister so I Love the books [laughter]\nHow many sisters do you have total I have three oh so you have one younger at one older well no

sat this neither my wife and rocket remember there ever recording this before even after the Farrah Khan turned my comments\nI'm also during the report when addressing the issue of armed security for places like the synagogue\nMore than one person commented that if we started this where would it and I couldn't help but think what a classic liberal response to think we can't do anything that might
