protected fashion helping them optimize and maximize their retirement so they can discovered uncover their hidden wealth so they can also\nHave their best retirement and baby boomers in particular police lean in and listen I Want to share with you what I've learned in over two decades of having a front row seat of helping boomers successfully\nRetire with a proven track record of measurable results\nThat will talk about and I've I've addressed one of the top three biggest baby boomer retirement respond to go back through them for those of us are just joining us\nAs a reminder all of our shows are archived at hitting wealth radio dot com but the good news is for those of you that really leaning listen this is the difference between maybe retiring or you're too early for those you trying to get to retirement or this maybe for those have you already in retirement\nAnd this is the difference between maybe retiring or you're too early for those who are trying to get to retirement or this may be for those of you already in retirement away to redirect otherwise spend about taxes or avoid major market losses or have an increasing income that allows you to visit your grandkids more regularly\nTo just with a tax savings we felt people are put five six ten Eighteen thousand a year back into their cash flow or maybe you're somebody listening that has a major um appreciated asset that you sold this year I've helped several clients this year zero out their tax bill\nOr drastically reduced their tax bill ... through part of what we call our six hidden wealth tax savings solution strategies that we can teach you\nBut here's the good news from attacks perspective this is without fail the greatest baby boomer retirement risks I've seen in my tenure in I I'll tell you why\nYou see the top three tips and I'll go through these quickly or what I called the biggest baby boomer retirement tip which is addressing the top three baby boomer retirement risk would be taxes on multiple levels folks will make this quick because taxes are going to be the thing that is going to they're going to keep you up at night because right now with the biggest tax cut in our history\nWe we ran a deficit with the largest amount of federal tax collected in our history we still rent a deficit and\nFolks they're gonna have to collect attacks from somebody\nAnd for those that have worked the hardest to save the hardest guess what you were the moving IRS tax target\nAnd you're not going to move far I can assure you because I'm seeing it daily in my practice of we're not just being a best selling author or ready national radio educator I'm somebody that has a total wealth architectural team\nAttacks team the whole nine yards and we sit with clients and I individually do this and take on a certain number of clients each year and I see the real impact of the choices some irrevocably that boomers are making\nThat are creating them to become what I called the perfect taxpayer right indirectly it just made Uncle Sam the bigger of the two business partners would I Want to teach you as you can eliminate Uncle Sam from the equation in other words get the IRS out of your ... get the government out of your retirement and so review said gosh my only regret\nAh with Chuck Oliver in in learning the hidden wealth ... strategies is that I didn't take the time to learn this big government tax scheme scams sooner\nBecause the reality is I had no idea how much tax I Would pay in suburbia listening you may say well Chuck I'm already retired at ... around the world can you save me taxes folks you'd be amazed you know when you eliminate or reduce somebody's required minimum distributions\nYou can put two three four five hundred six hundred dollars a month back into their budget I sat with clients that pay fifty to almost a hundred thousand a year in requirement um distributions and that was taxing eighty five percent of their Social Security was forcing their Medicare part B in deep premiums to go higher\nUm it's unfortunate that we see it all the time but there are there is not just the darkness of night there is a brightness\nTo the day and I'll talk to you about that the second one in my biggest baby boomer retirement yep this is coming from a new book I'll have out very soon inflation lifestyle income erosion gosh I see this all too often for those of you listening to have an annuity\nEspecially a two fold if it's an IRA annuity or or if it's a non IRA annuity there's two tax traps that you need to be aware of but it's mainly and inflation trap\nSo the inflation trap is a simple one when you lock in let's say somebody listening that have a pinch an option where you can take a lump sum pension like I met with a couple of this last a week before last or you can take a lumps lump sum versus the payout from the company will the path from the company would have cost his client an extra five to six grand a year of unnecessary\nOr you can take a lumps lump sum versus the payout from the company\nWill pay out from the company would have cost the client an extra five to six grand a year of unnecessary tax in the form of his Social Security being taxed as opposed to taking the lump sum\nBut here's the other catch the payout from the company had no cost of living adjustment\nMeaning that payment let's say is two thousand a month in twelve to Fifteen Years that two thousand a month only going to purchase a thousand dollars a month's worth of goods and services and then in another Fifteen Years it's only going to purchase five hundred dollars it's eroding folks\nAnd we see it all the time but the good news is you can go from good to better to best especially for those of you that I've met that have put a lot of money into indexed annuities the great news is you've anchor down and protected your principal but\nYou've limited your growth right you've limited that the ability to to get rid of tax 'cause you're always going to be taxed and if it's a non IRA\nUnfortunately you're going to leave a massive capital gain potentially to your children so there's ways that you can move out without paying penalties are surrender charges and go from good to better to best the the the last is pie in my biggest baby boomer retirement tip for my new upcoming book which is protection for market losses\nSeveral people get this confused with an annuity they think\nWill check already have one of those annuities or I have something like it folks this is a double digit potential upside returns with no downside exposure in fact when the market loses our clients that's an advantage to our clients\nMeaning because they get to lock in their prior games never at risk of giving them back and then they get a automatic reset\nOn the index like the S. and P. five hundred or the Dow Jones to then start there again where everybody else starts to make up for their losses the advantages help them out performed the market and our families own find family foundational\nOf finances is anger down with a good allocation into these special indexing solutions that avoid the downside market risk with protection so folks if if if you want to learn more\nUm I I'm going to go through with you the opportunity but some of you may want to just go out and register a space is limited\nAnd even though I'm teaching a complementary educational Web and are for those that registering attend I Want to give you my most recent book which is the baby boomer retirement break through the unfair advantage to a safe and secure\nRetirement and here's the opportunity just registering attend and you can do that simply by registering at retirement protected dot com that's retirement protected dot com there's a series of\nChoices of what times best fit in your schedule I teach all over the country so obviously we're on different time zones that people would much prefer so hurry before maybe your space is locked out now for those of you listening to easier to call\nIn and request and register a spot simply called eight five five six six eight to nine to eight that's eight five five\nSix six eight to nine to eight but you've got to hurry people have said darn it I should've got on it sooner I got locked out of that time this other time doesn't work that well for me I'll have to just do it the next week\nFolks every month that goes by on average we see that boomers lose about fifty thousand of network on average\nAnd that's and assuming no major tax increase in no major market dropped in that month or that year\nSo obviously procrastination is going to end up hurting people not helping and if you're married please attend this Web and our this educational complimentary\nWhether in Iraq and empower you an about an hour because you see that the decision or choice that that each spouse makes in their Social Security or their pension option or when they're going to withdraw from their IRAs or if they have to take requirements\nThe decision or choice that that each spouse makes and their Social Security or their pension option or when they're going to withdraw from their IRAs or if they have to take requirement um distributions\nIs going to impact the other spouse ... in a massive away and to say well you know I typically make all the ... financial decisions for the family that's great it's just getting on the same page on the Web and are can be very very helpful\nSo why tax rates for retirees can be expected to be higher now think about this well the the reason for that right is that in the I'm going to keep this kind of simple for you is the the fact is that many of boomers ended up getting any higher tax bracket why because\nEven though the tax brackets fall they end up facing a higher levy in the form of taxes on their Social Security benefits and higher Medicare part B in deep premiums\nAnd considering the additional taxes which then create more taxes or marginal rate could jump is highest forty percent\nAnd having a real life experience with what it means to be self employed and pay taxes on taxes and seeing a unfortunately people that are more in the accounting area of taxation not the tax savings area of taxation it's kind of a rigged game to be quite candid\nAnd the reality is ... you've got to become informed in order to benefit the most\nAnd you know even when we look at what was that a book out called the ... golden rules of retiring rich one of the main goals are one of the main rules I should say was the rich stay rich because they are savvy enough not to let Uncle Sam to too much of their money in other words\nRight they understand that being informed legally ethically morally to reduce your taxes\nIs perfectly allowed it's just the government has a tax plan for you\nIf you don't have a tax plan for yourself and when you think about this that the deficit right the treasury just reported that the deficit for fiscal year twenty Eighteen hit seven over seven hundred and eighty billion its up Seventeen percent\nRight now what's kind of a ... year about that right when you really think about it is that in in the end unusual jumped in a year which unemployment hit a five decades low\nRight that the economy experienced a significant expansion\nRight but the increase demonstrates that the tax cuts signed into law late last year have reduced federal revenues considerably even against the backdrop of the booming economies to think about it in an economy that just booming and similar view is shared that ride and we've been blessed to have this booming economy the reality is\nTaxes are are are unfortunately going to have to be collected more heavily\nBecause the revenues are falling they're falling because more people retiring so they're not consuming as much because now they're conserving\nBut also the fact that we've had these tax cuts on top of ten thousand people retiring a day and on Monday This past week the treasury reported that revenues acts that were predicted to be three point five three trillion were only three point three three trillion\nWhich is a two hundred billion dollar shortfall\nIn guess folks where they're going to collect that shortfall\nYeah they're going to collect the shortfall from the people that have worked the hardest to save the hardest are going to get tax the hardest\nRight and the tax that the cost the boomers can avoid that cost them the most or will cost them the most is taxation and the irony is the area that's causing people to most gets the least amount of attention until tax day rolls around so I Want to give a battle cry a shot across the bow of the importance\nOf thinking about taxes before the end of that President tax year right so what you can do to save tax has to be done and twenty teen if you want to save taxing twenty Eighteen\nAnd here's the reality that tax sale that's on with this new tax reform bill is only going to run through twenty twenty five\nSo to take advantage of each and every year Eighteen being the first year to take advantage of this this tax sale is vital you see a couple of people have learned that over the next years they can completely untaxed their IRAs which means they won't have any require minimum distribution\nWhich means they won't leave a tax burden to their kids but they also leave a tax burden to themselves while they're living because they won't subject\nHaving eighty five percent of their Social Security tax or that they're required distribution other IRAs is so large that forces there Medicare part B Andy premiums to be increased by three four hundred dollars per month each\nBooks we see it all the time I see people that are paying more tax in their eighties than the tax they paid in their highest wage earning years right\nIt all the time I see people that are paying more tax in their eighties than the tax they paid and their highest wage earning years right leading up to the year that they retired when they would have been their highest wage earning year their taxes are higher Twenty years later\nFolks that doesn't need to be that way the question is are you ready for your twenty teens tax and do you have a plan this better than the government's tax plan for you right I think of\nA Marty and Debbie right they use one of our hidden well tax savings strategies that actually enabled them to zero their income tax out for twenty team and it's already done\nI've done and Steve sold a highly appreciated asset that was exposing them to a massive capital gain cost\nIn legally eliminated the capital gains\nI think of mark and Donna right that they legally untaxed their IRAs in other words the governor the IRS is out of their IRAs\nThere isn't any concern about their you know distribution of their IRAs pushing them into a higher tax bracket or forcing eighty five percent of their Social Security to now be subject to tax\nAnd I think about Mick a mic is older and it was already retired but\nHis requirement of distribution was just annihilate in his taxes was pushing him into a higher tax bracket and we completely got rid of his required minimum distribution so whether those of you listening or trying to get to retirement\nAnd it's all about how you can reduce your your earned taxable income or you're somebody that's already in retirement and you're drawing money out of your hard earned savings of these tax deferred accounts\nOr some of even listening that have hit the milestone age of Seventeen and a half or the government then forces you to take these distributions the good news is folks you can save tax but you've got to act\nAnd here's the opportunity\nFor those of you listening that have saved and have concerns of your taxes this year saved a couple of hundred

here is not going to go down at all it's just going to go up\nBut to keep their monthly payments low more and more borrowers were opting for risky mortgages\nAnd all the things I Do I'd say probably Seventy five percent are adjustable rate mortgages\nAnd those who just were mortgages I'd say Ninety five percent or interest only\nAnd many lenders were stretching the limits offering so called subprime mortgages to those with shaky credit allowing them to buy homes they could barely afford\nTheir was underlying at this and derive for homeownership in the United states that was almost an

and member of the joint chiefs of staff\nGeneral you and I both know that the soldiers airmen sailors Marines they see someone with stars on their shoulder and they are a little bit reticent at times to address the issues they're facing bring up their complaints their concerns\nMilitary families usually do not have that same reticent so what are the military families in particular telling you about the difficulties that they're facing or what they'd like to see addressed when it comes to the guard\nWell in terms of families telling us or you know issues it's\nThey they they want a you know they would prefer to have a a more stable um access to health care I think one of their top issues is finding a way if we can to find you know try care or you know reserves select\nNah across the board and of course that's that's a there's a bill that goes with that I mean the good news is luckily most members serving in the military relatively healthy\nUm but uh you know access to continuous healthcare so you don't have to trust the transition from one to another is is a constant ask 'em you know from our from our ah our families out there another one might be um you know is a\nYou know I there are some clearly that ah that question the hey this this is the reserve commitment and and sometimes\nYou know family members are serving in the military tend to want to volunteer and deployed to go someplace and and uh they're doing deployments and they're doing very important things around the world for instance of a president's mission in the in the\nUh in the Pacific whether you're deployed to Thailand or whether you're deployed to the Philippines or whether you're deployed over there so that you can work with our allies and partners which is one of Secretary Mattis is\nPrime lines of effort inside the national defense\nStrategy is or sometimes they don't see the connection between the importance of that strategic president's mission or that might not be a in Afghanistan or Iraq so it's conveying to them the importance of what the rule we play now is this operational force across all missions that's\nI'm not just engaged can ethically perhaps in in Afghanistan and Iraq\nThe military is having recruiting issues this is something that has been acknowledged by each branch of the service it has to do with\nA number of factors the stress put on by multiple deployments you've got a lack of physical fitness among the recruiting pool or how is the guard dealing with the military recruiting issue that that I assume is facing you just as it's facing each other branch of the service you're exactly right Gary Eric\nGr recording is a is really one of our top priorities are right now and and that leads directly to renting is if you can't\nFill out your formations and find appropriate people who are fit and qualified and trained and ready to go then you aren't party United States army and party I nice states or force that they need and\nAnd so on the air side on the Air National guard this year we we exceeded are recruiting goals and we made the ants drank the allocated to us by the air force\nOr on the army's side and like all of the army components the active the reserves and and the national guard we failed to recruit the number of people we needed\nUm and that's a problem so I I think um we are uh you know trying to get our brand out there we feel like we need to make sure people understand exactly what it is that there are signing up for that to have an opportunity to serve and the guard not only at home\nUh but around the world and I I'll tell ya you know that the homeland mission is is something that is unique to us well when we have a devastating emergencies everybody pitches in all components all services everyone but as I was down there and panel Florida last week and I saw\nThe national guard delivering food and delivering water and doing the delivery supplies that these folks who are just absolutely devastated by hurricane Michael\nI mean there was a real sense of service to the community that is meaningful meaningful to a lot of people as meaningful to the people that community you appreciate it a very very much that you know in this devastation there is someone out there that has the capacity and the capabilities still to make sure that we're doing OK and a lot of people want to be part of that\nYou mentioned that metric front is one that the national guard is unique in the military and how they respond to issues like hurricanes Michael of course feeding Florida just this past week before that we have Florence in the Carolinas and actually a loan a guard member on her staff Kayla Jackson she was activists\nOf course feeding Florida just this past week before that we have Florence in the Carolinas and actually a loan God guard member on our staff cable jak and she was activated to go down to North Carolina for that\nAh it's been a busy couple of years since uh since uh since we started here at connecting that's on the domestic front I how is that going for the guard is that something that we've been able to deal with positively as far as what seems to be an increase in these events that we need to mobilize the guard for\n[noise] um yeah ... you know it is it is something that ah we plan for we do it's it it is let me stress first that you know the response to any domestic response is always a a team effort and it's a team effort um the the first in local responders who owned the immediate response peace\nOr augmented by the national guard augmented by all of the you know federal installations that happened to be around who come out of their gates and save people's lives and and do things regardless of what service there and um you know combined with a a really well coordinated in synchronized effort by us northern command\nWho's charges to synchronize all the military activity DOD activity or a port of FEMA and da and the first responders and and I think that\nWe really have gone a long way towards refining that process and and it's played out very very well in this last Hurricane Florence incurring hurricane Michael was really really seamless so you know my thanks to Kayla for deploying down to it deserves over governors' states like\nHe was with a in North Carolina about seven thousand other guardsman uh in North Carolina South Carolina that their responded to that and\nYou know I think it's a it is a unique piece of what we do we we planned for we're in the communities I as I was in the panhandle of Florida this past week I went to several armory who there were guardsmen plastered inside those armor he's\nA right there in Panama City Florida waiting for passage of the hurricane so they could run out the doors in and help police officers and firefighters and communicators and first responders and rescue people\nAnd their own facilities in their own homes were uh in fact demolished by that hurricane so um you know we we are there that our presence across all of the nation and twenty six hundred communities\nAllows us to be there at the point of impact from any disaster what what whatever it is whether it's a fire or tornado a hurricane you know we're in the response business and we coordinate\nWith first responders the people who are charged with making sure that you have an organized response on the ground at the scene and they know us and they know what capabilities we bring and not really a a thing of beauty to watch inside an emergency operations center\nAnywhere you go on any kind of emergency you'll see these people know each other they partner they're integrated and um it is a a a great way to speed or the saving of lives and and and mitigate a the suffering of people when ... when these kinds of events happen\nWe're speaking with general Josef ... United States air force the twenty eighth chief of the national guard bureau\nYou mentioned it earlier you sit on the joint chiefs of staff the chief of the national guard bureau is a fairly recent addition to the joint chiefs tell us exactly what you do uh on the ... the joint chiefs of staff and also what's it like being a chief of staff something that I Can't imagine you could have predicted earlier on in your career\nNow I certainly couldn't have predicted it and um you know I think uh it is a it's it's a great honor for me to be part of that group that I'm you know advise is the most senior civilian leaders in our in our nation and um you know that is in effect what numbers of joint chiefs do is they provide\nSeniors civilian leaders in our in our nation\nAnd um you know that is in effect what numbers of joint chiefs do is they provide best military advice so that civilian leaders and our nation can make decisions on on what they believe is the is the best option and the best the best thing for the nation do for our national security and\nAnd so all members of the joint chiefs do that they're a bunch of of really smart to vigils that I work with representing the joint chiefs from all the services\nAnd um you know like you said is new and uh you know I think we're still in the process inside the national guard girl of\nDeveloping a staff that can that can support to and and develop the knowledge and um you know so you can add value you want to be an at an add value peace the piece that I bring that's different from the other members is that in that connection to a non federalized piece of the force\nIt is not a a you know fifty for everybody for themselves program it's very well synchronized and coordinated and really owned by the combatant commanders\nOf your top priorities along with readiness and people as the twenty eighth chief of the national guard bureau is innovation also the recently announced that there is going to be a launch of a space force putting two and two together is there a space ...\nThe national guard bureau is innovation also they recently announced that there's going to be a launch of a space force putting two and two together is there a space guard in the near future general can you tell us anything about that or what role if any of the guard will play in the space for\nWell I'm a you know let me just say this first of all I'm what whatever uh you know the national guard does in the future it will be connected to space in some way that's just the nature of what this domain is doing you know as as as\nMilitary operations have changed\nUm it's kind of like cyber you know you you may think you're not in the cyber world but we always sit there and we use cyber and networks and the like every single day so it's it's an impossibility\nThat our future force structure in the national guard whatever that looks like whatever services in is not somehow connected and utilizing a the ... the components of space ...\nUm we have currently a in the national guard um you know ... a relatively small amount of space but space across the department is not hugely big in terms of structure so we have about a thousand people inside the national guard to do everything from you know space control a work as augment teas and launch operations\nOr or um you know you as much as considered spaces sitting in a ground based midcourse defense a missile silos in the center of Alaska to protect us from incoming uh ICBMs read so all of that kind of considered space folks\nUm you know what the ultimate spaced forest looks like where it's located um has not been determined and there's a there's a way to go and what that is but you know I think that our missions that's for sure I Will definitely be connected to the space force and so innovation you know it's just part of everything we do as as part of the chief where\nAs part of my priority that is try to find um you know some new new ways to use old things how is it that we can\nAdapt and transform ourselves to be a more ready for some more lethal force be a better contributor to the army into the Airforce and we've looked inside our our staff in some of that is in recruiting and how can we train more innovative Lee and we've looked at training models that states have options to is\nYou know should we moved to something different than weekend a month and two weeks a year would would for ten day blocks be better kind of a trainee model for us to look at so we're trying to look across the enterprise to say how can we take the most precious commodity are\nAren't guardsmen have which is time their access to them to train them to integrate with them and make a more ready lethal force and and so we have a lot of lot of people working on that and it's a it's it's a lot of time takes a lot a lot of our on our thoughts and what we do a National Guard with these days\nAs far as where space forces located seems simple to me we need a base on the moon obviously that's where the space where should be paid status we've been speaking with general Josef ... chief of the national guard bureau general you just mentioned recruiting again\nLet me ask you as we finished shop here Seventeen Eighteen Nineteen year old comes up to you and says hey why should I joined the national guard what do you tell that person\n[noise]

accomplished more given the opportunity to achieve more than any other program out there that that I can think of it it's enormously\nA satisfying to work in this environment on such a such a
