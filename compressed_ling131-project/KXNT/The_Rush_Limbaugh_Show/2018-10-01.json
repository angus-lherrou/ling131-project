what's happening\n[noise] ... it's a pleasure to be here\nUm I Wonder if your thoughts on on the ethical issues because of the fun to be paid if you recall during the doctor for us the money the prosecutor asked her how she was there for her legal fees and her security on as you mentioned her ... and those three pages of grave hosted a million dollars\nAnd I happen to be some kind of ethical issue if you could just accuse somebody without any kind of corporate evidence and then go public with that and raise you know that that amount of money it it it's a very very troubling thought\nIt was a lot of weird and fences there for people to make accusations that they could raise a lot of money or if you're crowding crowdsource\nLook this is a toughie uh in in a strict capitals sense she has identified a market and that is there are a range lunatics who want her to be right\nWho hope she's telling the truth they want her to continue to speak and tell it's true they want her lawyers to continue to strategize and screw cabin on their happiness\nSomebody sent me a note today that uh go fund me you'll find me is not new money laundering is essentially money laundering operation for the Democrats much like the unions were a because there's a lot of this money going to go a lot of this\nMoney is going to go to these two lawyers who are then going to be where they're already involved in Democrat\nParty politics so it's just it's a it's a new form of fundraising that's not call fundraising miss is made to look like people supporting hey big drag older and falsely accused a stressful oh\nReally in bad shape woman who can\nBarely barely get through the hearing how terrified they're happy to help and\nI you know this or that she's not the only one using it for ... there's a lot of Republicans Oregon a lot of people who are using go fund me pages to raise money for their legal bills and other expenses\nAnd if you can convince the American people to support you\nWell I mean there's there's a I don't think there's anything immediate there could be done to stop it and I don't think that you can draw any conclusions about\nHer from it um in terms of whether she's being truthful or not or if you wanted to draw conclusions that go fund me pages I'm I'm a way to get Democrats soccer's I eat voters\nTo pay for this other doesn't cost people who already have a lot of money anything then you could try to make that point that the Democrats are using these poor people but I don't think you're going to be able to find a way to stop this too widely you Jeff in Sarasota, Florida Hi great to have you here saw what's up\nHigh Russia just wanted to make a suggestion or an idea it's kind of a fantasy I don't think it would ever work but\nYou know the left is always like bullies and they'll do anything and they never had real pushback from our representatives on the right in Washington so you know when you have no ethics and your dirty tactics I often they have benefits for you coupled with the fact that\nYou know you never have to suffer the consequences yourself like a bully there's no reason to stop when your tactics work there's no reason to stop it said no fully as ever stopped until they get punched in the mouth that exactly maybe maybe it's time that you know we don't want to become them but maybe let's say for a year\nGraham said it it was great it was impassioned\nAnd that was the end of it\nIt was never to be heard again out of the mouth of any Republican and saw grams impassioned allegation of the Democrats\nWas followed by agreement with Jeff Flake [noise] to me that the FBI\nBe allowed to do one way to get their ... not all of fine senator Graham's point and he even went along with with like\nYou can't do these things as one offs\nIf you're going to tell people who the Democrats are if you're going to try to inform the country and what's really going on here you have to do it every day and you're going to have to do it multiple times a day it's going to have to\nBecome the central focus of your strategy on a day to day basis\nBut it never does we've had plenty of occasions in the past where some Republicans done a one off like that and it's been great and we have celebrated it we've shared way to go and dies except for here on TALK radio or maybe on Fox News but it dies\n\nWell Lindsey Graham didn't have to become them to do what he did he just has to be honest and he was\nLindsey Graham didn't have to worry about losing his soul in order to take it to these people and by the way did you notice not one of them on the Democrats I cared aware about what Graham said none of even got mad at it\nNot a single one of them even wanted to refute if they didn't care on the one that got a rise out of them was winning Feinstein was accused of leaking her letter\nSo she turned around and asked her staff did you guys Lincoln but no they said they didn't Lincoln Mr journal we didn't Lincoln I just asked my staff they said they did oh what about an investigation huh well Tom Cotton says we're going to investigate Feinstein ever going to investigate some of these other things that needs to be followed up on\nTheir needs to be follow through but I for one I Know investigations are innocent but I'm getting tired because all they are for the way\n\nHow hard is it the stand up and say Brett Kavanaugh is credible and there's ...\n... why is that is so hard she didn't have any evidence but she made a credible witness how well she was really\nOh\nNone of that is tablets just credibility\n\nAn attitude doesn't give us credibility pain and suffering doesn't equal credibility Democrats are always in pain and suffering or something\nNow want to go back to my production [noise]\nMy original prediction was that if the Republicans do not vote on this\nIf they don't vote out cabin on that committee him he doesn't get voted on he's if he's not confirmed Republicans are going to have held up by because voters are going to be fit to be tied up being led down again then the Democrats kept pulling stunts and it became\nConventional wisdom this gave up Republican voters are going to get some checked off Republican women and mothers are going to get so mad because they've got sons and they hate seeing what's happening in the capital and they don't want to imagine that happening there own camp there are going to show up in droves or I Want to take you into the future and I want you to think about something\n\nIf Brett Kavanaugh just think about this is a hypothetical I'm not predicting\nIf Brett Kavanaugh is not sworn in early next week\n\nIf you can hypothetically envisions a day where Kavanaugh is not confirmed not sworn in\nAre you going to be ... are you going to\nBe so mad that you can't wait to vote are you going to be so mad that you feel betrayed because if that happens at that moment where Kavanaugh is not sworn in meaning he has not confirmed it in the Senate\n\nYou think it's going to be easy for the Republicans who say you see what happened to Kevin off we're in the majority we couldn't get a good first you need to come out and vote for us how does that work\n\nThat's going to be pretty difficult asking Republicans that come out and vote to keep the majority\nWhen\nKavanaugh was not sworn in as everybody thinks that what voters are going to remember in November is this the unfairness to Kavanaugh the dirty tricks that Democrats are playing\nBut stop and think Kavanaugh is not sworn in\nAnd the Republicans think wow we're set up now man there's so many out there\nWere guaranteed to get their votes were going to there's going to be a Republican away because of what happened to Kevin on and then a Republican start campaigning and they start asking people to vote for them based on what happened to Kevin Oh you mean that he's not there you mean you didn't get sworn in Europe that majority\nWe know it's very small majority but you know the majority and he's not sworn in and you want us to how does this work folks\n\nMy point is it's very easy to sit here and say in the midst of all the Democrats trickery that it's going to fire people up on the Republican side of going to be some ticked off in Seoul man they're gonna show up and vote like they've never voted before\nBut if that's going to be the attitude if he's not sworn in\n\nRepublicans have been asking for the majority for a long time\nThey keep working\nAnd voting mostly because of Trump voters do they keep showing up because of Trump\nTrump alone will be able to make the case Trump alone will be able to turn a cabinet to defeat him to turn out but the Republicans in the Senate and the house I don't know how they do it vote for us Kavanaugh was defeated\nVote for us so it doesn't happen to the next nominee is that really effective I just don't I don't\nI hear too many people talking about it seems like every time you want a big turnout we have to do something so that people get fired up I've been hearing this since I've been doing this show back in Nineteen Ninety two people call here in certain rush Clinton needs to win\nThen people will see how bad the Democrats really are people see house don't say really are you kidding we lose and then tell ourselves we're going to win and we're still doing it here with Kevin Kevin on doesn't make it this is going to really fire people up why do we have to do was to fire up the base\nThat doesn't make any sense to me you know what I mean the other way around this is another trick\nI think that's played on Republicans your base is going to be really fired up if Kavanaugh doesn't make wait a minute the Republicans are the majority how the hell\nIs is is that advocacy for reelection or election that the guy doesn't make it\nWell rush [noise] voters are going to be so mad yeah yeah what\nThe guy got railroad railroaded and our guys couldn't stop it and wait and we're supposed to say well okay man we're really loaded now that's going to cause that turn up the ... sorry ... I don't think it works that way\n\nWhat people in in the hypothetical I just gave you what's going to happen is that voters are going to be out there saying even what we voted Republican\nDemocrat still run down\n\nAnd it doesn't equal show up keep elected re it's got to be the other way you got\nTo win this we have got to be the Democrats not lose to them\nAnd by the way I've had a lot of emails from a lot of uh people who think their expert political analysts and they all well\nNot all but I mean a whole bunch of them have this theory that the way they get the base all fired up we want to let them destroy\nA great life for great patriot a great American his whole career his future maybe he has family in order to win the midterms how does that work\nYour football team loses make you want to become a season ticket holder\nOr is it one day when that you want on the bandwagon and you want to be on the team why do we have to keep losing the fire up our base you talk about a trap\nShe asked me the media's behind that the Democrats at Washington establishment I got to take a break be back after\nThis like please we need more than ever rush leaky I meant for\nMost of my family they never graduated high school so I'm trying to break that barrier my daughter Brooklyn was also motivation for me to go back to school every day after work went straight to school and it paid off at age twenty four Karim ... is like cocoa coma I could not have done it allows us see their future is really right for me\nNo one can take 'em alone if you were thinking of ... or high school diploma you have now signed for you know education in union miniature diploma God or Brian he made a Dollar General ... and the outcome\nFrom the justice of heart ... studios twenty am north Las Vegas ...

[noise] see I got things that they will not you know what\nRole for uh the they knew movement at Tommy Lauren calls it and they finally get there and you're like\nShe's smart enough to know that all the people she was looking at you know that this is not true\nWhat you are doing is understanding but you're you're putting yourself in her position on wondering how you would be\nAnd you'll be terrified you'd be scared to death I and you might betray that your voice might be shaking and you might be forgetful and you might be nervous and jittery and support\nFor people under trained in this kind of thing yeah but I don't buy that that's who she is for a minute\nI think this was rehearsed ... script and ... she knew what she was gonna say and so forth I think it was practiced um she's ...\nShe's from saint ...\nThese people are left wing activists now um I I don't want to appear to just out of hand reject\nYour theory I Need to ask you a question do honestly that there is no wrong answer here did not misinterpreting tone and my boy so I'm actually asking for you to help me was she credible to you because of her demeanor and her lawyers on her up speaking a\nTechnique and her parents nervousness did she come across as credible you believe in\nYou know that's exactly what I just said she came across as someone who was sitting in front of a bunch of people telling a lie and the reason why she was able to have be ... shaky and nervous and looked like someone who had been raped her because she knew she was lying on national TV\nOkay I I heard that I thought I thought you said the reasons he comes across as credible is because she is none of the people identify with suffering and pain and all that but\nShe's she's a waiver and scared undermined because of what she's doing\nWell and she was asked to do something really stupid you shouldn't have to have a conscience for that you'd think leftists leftist can't survive with conscience is I look she is willingly\nAnd not just following she is leading now an effort to destroy literally destroy another human being his life's work his family\nHis past and his future\nYou you\nGot to have no conscience it'd be doing that and and she her description of what happened to her [noise] um [noise] well\nCouldn't do what she's doing but not because I'd be nervous because I couldn't live\nIf I were participating in an effort that had an entire political party depending on me to pull it off to destroy\nAnother human being if it weren't true I couldn't do it\nAnd I don't think they have any problem doing it I mean they are trained\nThey are trained in this kind of political tactic that's what being a leftist is they are not docile like you and I am living their lives in politics happens there'll be a part of it politics is everything in his their identity\n[noise] and\n\nTo come forward with a story like this to know that you can't offer corroboration or proof you've got to be really certain that nothing's gonna happen to you\nYou got to be certain that the party is going to protect you that your lawyers are going over to you got to be certain of Republicans aren't going to do it in to you and how do you do that you appear to be a woman in distress who has been abused and so forth\nAnd since everybody knows Republicans have women and having a having a war on women you can be assured the Republicans aren't going to lay a glove on you know not even going to try but at the end of all what have you done you have destroyed the life the achievements the future and the family of a fellow human being\nIt's about time people learned what we're up against them who these people are and what not learning what they're capable of its admitting it because it's happening way way too often I
