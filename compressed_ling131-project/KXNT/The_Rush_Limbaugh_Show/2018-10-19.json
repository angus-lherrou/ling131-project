disagree with your assessment of what this election is about the main voting issue is not immigration or health care is is that the Democrats voting base is a bunch of nuts\n[noise] I Wish that were true I have tried to make that a fundamental issue in people's minds literal insanity\nThe psychological disorders and I mean that with every essence of my being I think much of the Democratic party agenda has derived from their voters being psychologically\nScrewed up\nThey are suffering psychological disorders because of the things that have happened to them in their lives and they want to blame the country for it they want to blame the patriarchy they want to blame the founding\nBut then they they they claim that the only fix for it is the government punishing the people that did whatever happened to these people\nAnd the Democratic party has embraced all of these various psychological disorders and abnormalities\nAnd try to normalize them all\nBy training them as policy planks in the Democratic party platform if you will\nAnd that's how we ended up with people or represent two tenths of one percent of the population\nGiving a whole way of the Democratic party thrown behind them to make their issue one in which the otherwise vast majority can end up being bullied into submission\nI have tried to ... ... even before but it's just civically since the Kavanaugh hearings to make the point that that's what we're up against the that's what it's going to end up trying to bring in women ... if the Democrats win the house all of that abnormality is going to achieve power at when they have the\nPower to actually implement their forms of punishment\nAgainst groups of people they blame for whatever is wrong in their lives these are not people that think they can fix things themselves they're not people that\nIdentity their religion whatever Democratic Party is helpful in making all these people believe they are justified in thinking\nThat life is miserable because of all these horrible other people what they've done to them and then the Democratic party to let us fix it for you we'll become your champions will punish these people for you and the\nDemocratic voter basically yeah yeah yeah yeah now what you need to do is examine every Democrat constituency group that they've been representing the last to take your pick ten years twenty fifty and ask yourself if any of the people in those groups\nHave become happy\nHave had their issues addressed and fix or are they as miserable as they've always been are they as angry as they've always been if not more so are they still complaining today about things they were complaining about injustice discrimination a mistreatment\nThe day Donald Trump won the presidency is the Trump would

if they're going to edit out palsy you may as well just give up being on the [noise] system email from a man I understand the sentiment out there but I'm not sure that's quite right up\nNew York post New York post just published headline migrants caravan heading for us turns around in Mexico you seen this anywhere else\nI habits not on drugs yet uh so I I report this who you're with a little bit of caution\nThe caravan of Honduran migrants have turned around today a day after reaching the magical wipe them out of border according to a report what's The Simpsons ... posted\nIt today pee story the or support thousand migrants fled their lives of poverty and violence in the Central American country with the hope to make they were born in ... nothing about this was organic you look Trump's right to ask who's paying for this who is buying food\nWho is buying the water and distributing and who is paid for the gasoline for the vehicles being used\nWhere are these people are taking care of hide Gemini\nRid of whoever the media targets I I think first it's certainly the first six to eight months of two thousand Seventeen Trump's first year I think the Republicans didn't do anything to help him 'cause they didn't think he was going to survive\nAnd\nIt it that's one of the reasons that the Obamacare repeal and replace didn't go anywhere because the Republicans just bought into the notion that most of the country actually hated Trump despite the fact that he had been elected and it's been a slow reversal than a slow realization on a part of the Republicans the Trump is the guy\nAnd the Trump is immensely popular particularly on the Republican side well\nWe'll see if this story on the caravan turning around Pompeo is there a palm payroll left Saudi Arabia after having met with king Solomon and Mohammed bin so I'm On the crown prince you flew to Mexico\nAnd they have to know that Trump is not going to put up with this and I think that was the message compelled to look so we got one report from a peanut the caravan has turned around\nNow if that's true whoever is paying for this is gonna have to keep paying for those people to go wherever they go next are they going to go back to Honduras by going to go back to Guatemala are they going to go to holding places in weight\nTo try to do the caravan all over are they going to try to sneak them in in smaller groups rather than as part of this gigantic\nMob\nOnly time will tell thanks again Todd this is Jeremy in Mayfield, Kentucky you our next on open line friday Hi\nThanks for taking my call Russian my coming loud and clear you are sir here you're just fine\nThanks it's a sixty dollar Samsung so you know whatever but uh yeah you know I'm an hour\nWe all have our obstacles to bear and life and your your overcoming us pretty well I hear your pretty well\nThank you uh you know I'm a ... I voted for Trump\nOf our obstacles to Baron life and your your overcoming us pretty well I hear you pretty well\nThey keep uh you know I'm a Trump I voted for Trump Madden Trump voter and America First and most historic sense and I'm an American patriot so take that in contact with my question here\nHow can the United states the ... with countries and you mentioned this in the first part of your monologue we're allies with the Saudi Arabia and Israel\nHow can we be allies with Saudi Arabia when the Pentagon papers released and twenty six team showed that they funded nine eleven also Israel has attacked is in the past like a used his liberty with all of unfair can you clear that are forming\nWell on the Saudis side yeah the uh the the Israeli spy on us to everybody spies on everybody you know Jonathan Pollard it was an Israeli spider got caught and the Israelis wanted it back on harmed we said screw you you know where your benefactor old spy on us and like I said yes we do\nAnd we're going to continue the spike us we can't trust anybody where Israel\nAnd a particular when Democrats are in the White House that's a factor now when it comes to the Saudis I Want to share with you because your question here is really good\nI remember after nine eleven happened when when I learned that either it was either all Nineteen or white Ninety percent eighty percent of the Nineteen hijackers were Saudi\nI remember I was talking to William F luckily junior about number thing not just this and I brought that up and I remember him getting frustrated with me about it he said what does it ever do anything I ...\nI don't understand the Saudi Government supposedly is an ally and yet these hijackers\nCome from Saudi Arabia are you saying the Saudi royal family is behind live\nI said how can we say that they're not\nThat is when I began to try to learn about the relationship to the Saudi up the Saudi royal family to Islam\nAnd that's what I started asking experts\nAre at at one of the people I talked to was Andy McCarthy again because he has tried as a United States attorney assist the United states attorney southern district of Manhattan he was the lead prosecutor on the blind shaped case\nAnd it was ending who said that he thought the blind check was just acting out to being a radical uh inventor of various aspects of Islam\nAs part of his technique to mobilize and create even more membership and his group and then he he started reading the things that the blind shake believes and he found out\nNone of this is made up this this this call for terrorism dealing with infidels it's right there in the current if you read it right\nThis is exactly what what is in the book and he was stunned when he told me was so when you then realized that the Saudi royal family is in charge of\nWorld wide Islam because the holy sites or their mecca\nAnd Medina Medina I've found that it is absolutely true that the Saudi royal family\n\nIs essentially the the shield and the impetus\nBehind worldwide Islam well in Saudi Arabia\nIf the shield and the impetus behind worldwide Islam well in Saudi Arabia\nThe branch of Islam that is I for just to make it easier here and being understood terrorists Islam comes from ... from those you heard me say this yesterday beg your indulgence\n... hobby Islam is where they really radical clerics and the moms are who are welcoming\nAnybody they can into their mosques and just literally converting them into\nSuicide bombers terrorists and what have you under the auspices of Islam and the Saudi royal family\nStood by and let it all happened whether they were instrumental in advocating it don't know but Saudi funded charities all over the world promoted while hobby is\nAnd that's what I went back to Mr Buckley aside I don't I don't see how the Saudi royal family the Saudi Government can be separated from these Nineteen hijackers well\nThat's why it's interesting to tell the story of the crown prince Mohammed bin solve Mont\nMohammed bin ... wants to if we didn't believe him he wants to reform the Saudi Arabian peninsula the whole country and its relationship to Islam\nAll because of money economics primarily he doesn't like the fact that Saudi Arabia is solely dependent on the sale of oil for all of its wealth he wants to branch out\nHe wants other people investing other industries individuals investing in Saudi Arabia for things unrelated dollars are Petro dollars oil\nSo he sought out the interest in Hollywood Silicon Valley and the typical places in other countries as well\nAnd part and parcel of his reform is the\nI don't know what word abandonment origami a distance thing from well how is it\n\nAccording to have been some on Saudi Arabia cannot modernize and cannot achieve his reform goals if ... is still\nThe branch of Islam associated with the Saudi royal family\nWell\nThis brings us to your show gay again and the Muslim Brotherhood they don't want any of these reforms they don't want any western influences in any Islamic country much less Saudi Arabia where mecca I'm a diehard they do not want while habits of watered down they do not\nThey want the Arab Spring they don't want secularism anywhere and Mohammed bin ... among represents a bit of that and it's fascinating that he's been brought to a screeching halt on these reforms\nThe ... this has brought to a screeching and now there's this story today that the royal family they they have a council you might I often wondered well who determines these kings have countless sons they've got Fifteen different wives they've got kids with every one of their wives saw Saudi king can have twenty sons\nHow does he determine which one's the crown prince how does your determine which one's going to be as air it's not just first in line they have a council they have an inter family council a royal family council that\nDetermines\nThe lineage of the crown prince the heirs and in what order\nThen saw mom Mohammed bin Salman is not the ...\nBut when the edge of the crown prince the heirs and in what order then saw mom Mohammed bin Salman is not the oldest son of the current\nKing Solomon\nHe was chosen largely because of his reform ideas but now a story out today says it the widow if it's true or not the royal family is having a crisis meetings and maybe going to replace Mohammad bin saw him on as ground friends\nKnow many people think that this was up to the king the king determines what your his sons is going to be in the next king but it's not the case so all of these plans for modernization if they were true I have to throw that I was a cab you got all these plans for reform\nThe mid term election\nRegister now on I Am a voter dot com and don't forget to

... there's not a Britain it's been all aimed at stopping anybody from crossing is the point his his point was that the Democrats may be trying to illustrate the Trump hasn't gotten that done isn't going to get it done maybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that\nDone isn't going to get it done maybe doesn't really care about getting it I remember these people are focused on trying to demonstrate that Trump is a phony is not who he says he is and they want to distance Trump's voters from them and that's all the callers theory was\nHow I don't think that could happen these done too much into a little time\nOh I don't either get on the leaders but it was it was his theory as to what the purpose of this caravan is uh I I Know that there have been in a little incremental appropriations aimed at building the wall\nBut his point was how many continuing resolutions have we have independent budget deals if we had and then there's not\nAnd we have control of the house and control of the Senate and there isn't any money in the wall for yet not serious money and certainly not serious construction in there for his theory was that the Democrats\nAre trying to demonstrate there is never going to happen and Trump doesn't even care than it ain't going to happen\nAnd what better way illustrators and four thousand people storming the border and not being stopped\nAh let's see grabs sound bite number four team Nikki Haley she went to the Al Smith dinner in New York last night we aren't normally only hear about

candidate show up at this thing\nAnd it's always two to three weeks before the election\nAnd they do they they show up and it's a night of comedy Ninety five percent and the other the other five percent of the speeches um get serious and political and they all show up and it's incredible to that the Al Smith dinner\nOr at least the ones I've watched who ever writes the jokes for these candidates for this dinner is they they got to be among the best every candidate there have been some exception exceptions but seems like every candidate just have some of the best funniest material\nAnd I you know I Wonder where they find it and it's obvious in their hiring joke writers but for where we don't know well Nikki Haley showed up at the Al Smith dinner last night I mean she

less that we don't have this on tape or in audio\nBut she chastised Trump last night she Sandy in America and domestic politics we do not call our political opponents evil and of\nCourse through da da da\nDa na ... well who else does but Trump calls the press evil\nAnd the Democrats evil and so it's that comment that that made people think aha she's she's actually go unfortunately going to go for the Republican nomination at some point maybe not twenty Twenty one twenty four and she is beginning the process of distancing herself as a Republican from Trump\nBut her funny lines had to do with
