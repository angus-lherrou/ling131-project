looking to build computers range any white readings folks great to have your we have for the first time\nWell it's tough to say first we have an official there is no bones about it no mistake about it we have an official complete and total alignment among the drive by media now in the\nLast two weeks before the mid term elections in the mainstream media is completely open minded they are completely in sync they are totally coordinated it doesn't matter where you go in the drive by media today\nYou were going to see\nEverything under act as a subject heading or an umbrella Trump spreads wise and stokes fear a head of election\nThat graphic has been on CNN Ninety five percent of the of the time today\nSo much so I took a picture of it here to make sure that I Would remember it verbatim Trump's brand lies and stokes fears ahead of\nElection Washington Post headline\nTrump and Republican settle on fear and false ... as a mid term strategy\nSame paper\nAll through the two thousand sixteen campaign said that Trump would end up being another Hitler that Paul Krugman in the New York times said would cause an economic collapse from which the country would never recover\nThis sort of NBC suggest robust it as soon as he as him among colonel eight Republican voters that couldn't put a dent in Democrat hopes for a blue wave\nRepublicans typically dominate early voting by absentee ballots while Democrats tend to have the advantage when in person early voting so for example the entire early voting patriot in Florida which is you have to begin in person voting is complete\n\nNow that that is somewhat of a important point there because it's it's not just that the Republicans are doing better than Democrats and the states\nIt is that early voting almost always favors Democrats the usual pattern for all this stuff is that for Democrats are drawn up in the early Italy and\nBecause of early voting and the Republicans have to then make up for a bat\nOn election day itself but that's not what we're seeing here and they get Mrs NBC News so the question here ... hard to apply this to the actual election outcomes too much we don't know but one thing we do know this is not this is not according to mention was a conventional wisdom is\nAnd conventional wisdom has been the Republican enthusiasm is kind of suppressed\nThat Democrat enthusiasm is off the charts that the Democrats have\nBeen so motivated ever since they got screwed in two thousand sixty ever since Trump and the Russians stole that election from the Democrats have been motivated or like you can't believe they get out\nThere and make this right and correct it and fix it they haven't been inspired David energized they'd been motivated they been donating they cannot wait and yet\nIn eight\nThey'd been motivated they'd been donating they cannot wait and yet\nIn eight key Republican state key key\nBattleground states Republican early voting is dwarfing Democrat early voting\nAnd violating all s dad wished norms all statistical norms\nAnd how do you factor is is this is the kind\nOf resolve the kind of thing that's happening but nobody in conventional Washington\nElitist establishment Washington\nWould you ever think what's happened these people come up with their story that stick with it if it even if it means they're lying to themselves about it like for example if they if they get it in their heads the everybody hates Trump\nAnd that hatred for Trump has grown and and it magnified over two years ... therefore there's going to be this massive\nTurnout among Democrats can't wait to vote energized and they get that in their hands and they believe it and then the exact opposite happens\nAnd they don't know what to do about it and they get\nNon plus and a little concerned about which is where\nThey are now and I've shared with you yesterday there's a there's a a lot of stories [noise]\nUh about the blue wave not happening that it simply doesn't look like it is materialize and here is the Washington Post battleground house district remained close in a new poll over here we got the cook report\nEight more seats flip Democrats how many seats are left to flip Democrat you listen to cook report every seats beyond Democrat by now\nAnd if you listen to the Nate Silver\nEighty five eighty six percent chance the Republicans lose the house eighty six percent chance of Democrats wonder how does all this fit together\nWell it doesn't obviously\nIf Republican early voting is out distancing Democrat early voting and Democrats have always owned that\nMust mean that something is drastically wrong here something is terribly wrong and the formula for this\nKind of Republican enthusiasm in an off year mid term election where so many people quote unquote hate Trump\nThis doesn't compute\nThere ought not be this much Republican early voting action there ought not be anywhere near this kind of a boozy as of yet\nLast night in Houston\nUn Seventeen Eighteen
