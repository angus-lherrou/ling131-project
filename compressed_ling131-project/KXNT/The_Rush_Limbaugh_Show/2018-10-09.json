their clothing Ruth ginsburg\nWho well never mind yeah\nShe was awake um [noise] she's admitted that she shows up in states of the union speeches having consume a little wine\nTo get through the night that's why she is seen falling asleep at of course this is nothing wrong with that uh\nI'm Elena Kagan was there the Harvard law school dean way back when hired Kavanaugh to teach at Harvard you lay the Kagan who now says I don't think he should be on the court I I'm not\nSure that this is going to do the court any good\nA Justice Thomas was there a whole bunch of people Anthony Kennedy who is a Kevin O's replacing and here is the president of the United states will start to hear an audio soundbites seven he is apologizing the cabin on on behalf of the nation\nI Would like to begin tonight's proceedings differently than perhaps any other event of such magnitude on behalf of our nation I Want to apologize to Brett and the entire Kavanaugh family for the terrible pain and suffering you have been forced to endure\nThose who stepped forward just serve our country deserve a fair and dignified evaluation not a campaign of political and personal destruction based on lies and deception\nJust calling them out this Trump is right this is not done what normally when you get to the ceremonial swearing in\nYou follow the script and all of that is in the past it's not to be referenced again the fight is over everybody acknowledges that the result is the result we're moving forward except that's not the way it is anymore the Democrats are not stopping the fights not over to them\nThe Democrats are openly promising to impeach Kevin other openly promising that continue investigate Kevin on\nThey are openly talking about packing the court if they win the house of representatives to nullify the or the power capital has as the fifth so call conservative justice on the court they're not pulling back at all this is one of the word over\nAnd so Trump is calling them out and I told you folks this is crucial we don't I Can't think of any former president what would ever do anything like this in defense of his nominee in defense of his principles I Can't think of one who would do it\nAnd it's just as important the Trump do this as it was important when Trump at a rally explained to the American people what the American media had not told them when he recites the essence of her testimony\nBut his illegitimacy is born of a simple fact that he's not on their team that he's not one of them\nSo anything that can get rid of him and directly in their world is entirely not just permissible but it's required if you have to deny him the presumption of innocence then that's what we'll do\nIf you bring forward a woman who can't prove what she says but his believable saying it then that's fine that's what we'll do\n\nIf it takes the Democrats and Chuck Schumer and Dianne Feinstein strategizing together for a month coming up with this\nThen that's what we'll do\nIt has nothing to do with anything other than Kavanaugh isn't them and he therefore doesn't deserve to be on the Supreme Court the rest of it the history onyx the child like wailing immaturity is the result\nOf the\nLiberals socialist mindset on people young people immature children that don't get their way or the suffering psychological disorders of one way one kind or another\nVideo a video of these kids\nOn Saturday afternoon literally rolling at the doors of the Supreme Court they get in\nTo try to stop the real swearing in they were literally calling at the doors there wasn't any humanity and miss this was just raw hatred and fear\nWith massive site disorders all of it promoted not denounced all of it promoted and encouraged by the powers that be and the media and the Democrat Party and the ... of the left\nAs I say what a decent people do response to the different people or we're we're not going to become them\nThey may have as an objective with a real one nation and total human destruction of their opponents that's us\nDo not doubt me on this that may sound a little extreme to those of us that are here on the periphery but do not tell me that is their objective total destruction and ruin nation\nWell how do we find that these people are not going to try to ruin their political opponents gonna try to beat them but we're not going to become who they are we don't have an image to become who they are so given that how are they stopped\nIt's a serious question\nIf they are willing to do anything including ... facto career and life political murder\nTo stop things they don't want to stop people that they don't want how do you how do you\nOppose them how to you beat that back\nDo you do it with the city to do it with politeness do you do it with\nManners I'm Sorry I'm going to cut it\nSorry never Trump has bought the right manners and ... and so forth isn't going to cut it some people might say Russia trick the churches rock solve all the churches where enduring about [noise]\nUh not anymore the churches are like every other institutions sucking up the people they hold power everybody needs money\nChurches need money all kinds of people need money and if the people are going to give you money demand that you be a certain way and be open to certain things then you're going to do it this is half that take a look at your papa\nAnd what's even happening to the Catholic Church in places serious serious problem when talking about the preservation of what I call our way of life underneath the umbrella of decency\nSo we're very lucky we have somebody willing to push back against it from the highest\n\nLevels of power in the country Donald Trump fearless sleep pushes back on it are caused amount identifies them\nThey're not used to this they don't know how to react to it media is the greatest illustration of that not knowing how to react to being called out for what you really are\nI mean everybody's accused the media being biased over the years but nobody accuses them of fake making it up\nParticipating in the open and wants in ruins a nation of people nobody ever accuses them of that not not I mean we may hear but at the highest levels of governance never happened before there's Donald Trump doing it and from the East Room of the White House here is more Trump last night\nThis really triggered him when he declared Kavanaugh innocent\nWhat happened to the Kavanaugh family violates every notion of fairness decency and due process our country a man or woman must always be presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty [noise]\n\nThat I must say that use are under historic scrutiny were proven innocent thank\nYou [laughter] [noise]\nMargaret analyze your father is a great man he's a man of decency character kindness encourage who is devoted his life to serving his fellow citizens\nYou know what that is I'm\nSorry never Trump or his but that's just pure class\nTo take the time to look at those two little girls and tell them that their father is a great man in the midst of all of this the president of the United states taking time out to tell those two young daughters\nOf breath and actually Kavanaugh your father is a great man every father wants to hear that every father loves having his children told him he was a great man few ever are afforded that\nOpportunity but Trump did it last night\nThen proclaiming Kavanaugh's innocence I mean that is akin to taking all the poison the arrows at every Democrat launched it Kevin all the past two weeks and firing them back at once right down the throats of every Democrat Senator on the Judiciary Committee in every member of the media tried to ruin Kavanaugh\nTo openly proclaiming him innocent\n\nHe can't do that that was in a corner or he doesn't know but they had him guilty didn't say he was guilty simply on the basis of the allegation\n\nI Want to say one more time I don't believe anything that we went through the past two weeks starting with the realization that Christine Blasey Ford and written a letter to ... I don't think any of it was spontaneous\nAnd I don't think any of it was happenstance I think every bit of it was an orchestrated campaign just like every other October surprise in politics is\nI think the Democrats were in on it I don't know whether ... privacy was violated I don't know if she was in on it or if she was also a storage\nBut somebody suggested she writes that letter Monica McLean her buddy who has FBI connections to Preet Bharara who hates Trump the yesterday and why the United states attorney as well as all these FBI people trying to prove Trump Russia collusion\n\nI don't think they ever expected it to get as far as it did they thought Trump would pull back withdraw the nomination on Kavanaugh would pull out and they would never get as far as ... as it got very it was\nClearly\nIllustrated she had no evidence no cooperation no nothing in their strategizing of this event they never thought of her to go that far\nOne of the reasons is there used to Republican presidents caving nominee gets in big trouble pull the nomination presidents don't want the grief starts reflect\nPoorly on them they go to the nomination look [noise] and won't work nominate we can't sustain this you got to pull out nominees Assad damn it's my one sorry nominee up pulling my support nominee president get together for the good of the country blah blah blah blah nominee pulls out didn't happen\nHere Trump refused pullout withdraw ghetto capital that's where they gum up the works anyway I got to take on another brief time out and just getting warmed\nHere so we hang one we had when there's the novelty of all time Rush Limbaugh\nThey live on you know\nWhen you put a safe in your home what will you put in it\nWhat are your most valuable possessions well there's just one brand of safe you should trust to put in your home and that's right oh saves\nThe craftsmanship of their iron works apes which are made in America one of the measure\nIt takes skill sweat and talent\nTo produce the most beautiful and secure or safe in the world and that's what rhino saves are beautiful creations that help keep your possessions secured part art part furniture and one hundred percent security rhino saves are built to protect you and your family from the uncertainties of this world now\nUp to Seventy percent off that's right I court furniture parents and our cats are Seventy percent off new retail prices and she was from a wide variety of previously in these furniture and acorn for your home or on a cell phone from one Ninety nine Ninety nine bedrooms that from three Ninety nine Ninety nine\nDining said from two Ninety nine Ninety nine and more all items are core certify guaranteed and in stock value for delivery or to take home today make the smart choice and visit one of our five locations in the ... or go on line at court Clarence furniture dot com mentioned radio twenty and get twenty percent off\nYeah yeah a ... a radio dot com station [noise]\nCBS News on the hour sponsored by their works relief\nI'm Steve Kaye finished getaway day in the Florida Panhandle those people in vulnerable areas head for higher ground ahead of hurricane Michael governor Rick Scott\nEvery family must be prepared now take this seriously and keep your family safe\nCBS News meteorologist David Parkinson says right now the storms packing top winds of a hundred ten miles an hour and will likely pose a threat to life and limb when it comes to shore tomorrow in this\nPart that's going to kill people in the storm surge you're looking at an eight to twelve foot storm surge which is beyond the first floor of a home\nAs it heads inland storms expected to be a big rain maker all throughout the southeast North Carolina governor Roy Cooper\nI Know people are fatigue from for us but don't let this storm catch you with your guard\nDown strong winds from the storm of already pushed high water into low lying areas in coastal Louisiana Nikki Haley's social leave her post as United Nations ambassador by the end of the year she sat next to President Trump at the White House to announce the moving she indicated a presidential run is not in her plans\nYou know I'm not running for trying twenty I can promise you what are we doing it for that point so I look forward to supporting the president\nIn California there's an investigation into the state DMV KCBS radios Holly ... some non citizens became registered voter\nCan happen when some applicants accidentally field in the wrong box for voter eligibility and then ask DMV workers and fix it it was those corrections that didn't get properly long this is on top of revelations that the agency botched voter registration fourth and twenty three thousand people but you know virtually swapping their party preferences\nOverseas Turkish authorities plan to search the Saudi consulate in Istanbul as concern mounts over the missing journalist Jamal ...

I'll\nGet right to the point I have one comment one question and comment is\nIt's going around this talking point that ah you know since his cabinet victory that ah the president is teaching Republicans how to fight I actually think he's teaching the Democrats what it's like to lose and I don't think anybody's picking up on that 'cause they're not used to losing like there used to the Republican just given it\nAnd and the question I had was what do you think would happen it 'cause I don't know what's gonna happen I actually think this blue wave talk is is not true from what I'm seeing out here what do you think what happened to the Democrats in the media\nIf instead of a blue wave if there was a red I mean what do you think actually what happened do you think they self destruct I mean what would the day after look\nI have been you know I think it's a good question because I myself have been thinking about that in terms of survival\nUh and safety because I think if the Democrats do not win the house and if you if you listen to scuttle but sounds like our bodies preparing for the Republicans to\nHold the Senate maybe even expand it or hold there but the conventional wisdom is that the Democrats are going to retake the house in numbers we haven't seen and who\nKnows how ISIS Nineteen Ninety four and I've been wondering what if what if all of this is just a bunch of ...\nMedia and and and pulling unit manufactured\nJust like it was in two thousand sixteen they were not very many polls in two thousand sixty and it got even close to being right Rasmussen was won by the way Rasmussen as trumpet fifty one percent approval CNN approval number for Trump is forty one\nOr the ... the polling David the drive by some trust shows them just even now after the Capitol hearing expanding\nThe blue wave\nMeanwhile do you know that the Republican candidate just as an aside here the Republican candidate for governor of California is only six or seven points back\n\nThe Republican the I got a note from Newt Gingrich about this overnight that the Republican to I'll have to find it a buck the Republican governor of California is is closer than running if Gavin Newsom than anybody would ever have believed possible\nCops are running around trying to prove this guy's a rubber band of the first order and\nYou know no no officer you know\nOur government money is separating the two parents that are born or I I Am having them\nAnd the cops we fought everything oh wow we don't have a pervert here we have a hero this guy and I watched and said well that's it for the show\nThe level of idiocy and stupidity and ignorance that just permeates\nPlaces in this country where it ought not be there people ought to be more educated more informants smarter\nBut that's gone we have replaced\nInformed people educated people learn in people with Avon so load block cab idiots\n\nWere not separating and Trump never did separate families at the border that is actually Democrat Party policy it's related to families crossing the border illegally seeking asylum\nTrump in fact wrote an executive order to end it\nWhich was beaten back on the basis that it was unconstitutional lift the statute in America today says families will be separated\nManaged to protect the kids the reason for the reason for the separation is the parents are shoveled off in the holding cells while their cases are adjudicated so I'm watching this stupid show and I see a guy who\nAny under normal season will be a pervert with a bunch of kids in cages in his basement converted into a\nQueen size zero because he is rounding up kids that Trump is separating from their parents and saving them\nSo I went to the DVR and I cancel law and order and you're SUV I get rid of that had been out there long enough twenty some odd years anyway so and they're all dropping like flies they all feature stuff like this in it\nSo\nYou really you think that\nTwo hundred nine Republican House seats can be up for grabs be cause people all over this country are fed up with Trump and the Republicans separating\n[noise]\nWell uh\nThat wasn't explained to other night services it's a lot of Republican tournaments what yeah committee chairman are retiring because they're limited\nForty three members are entire summer committed German and the reason they're quitting is because they don't want to go back to being average ordinary members when you're a committee chairman you got perks you got attention get t._v. time\nYou know you matter but when you're a term limited out of your chairmanship when you quit and your parlay your time there and the big bucks in the private sector\nYou know there are some Republican retirements but there are two hundred and nine of them\nBut my my only point is for there to be this kind of blue wave forty four forty seven of retirements does not explain it not with the Democrats think they've got two hundred nine seats leaning in their favor\n\nOr you don't take its policy well there were people if this is all true there has to be something or a series of things\nThat the American public is just to be tied over and want to take it all out of the Republicans as again the media to Democrats will tell you it's Trump the people in this country hate Trump they're embarrassed of Trump but that's what they think\n\nThe evidence that the country hates Trump just isn't there in any even if even if you look at the leftist opinion polls at forty one percent approval that's not in the twenties where George W.
