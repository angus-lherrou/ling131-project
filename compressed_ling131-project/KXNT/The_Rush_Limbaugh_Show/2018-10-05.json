on 'cause I don't care as phony folk conservative is named Jennifer Rubin\nA yogurt is\nJennifer Rubin it's amazing the transformation this woman has made the Washington Post hired her as a conservative blogger\nDuring the Obama years during the Obama years for the most part she came across as a conservative blogger and then when Trump gets elected she became I think what she's always been just died\nThe cast in the wool liberal\nAnd now she has a the still the conservative columnist or blogger at the post but she's not conservative and MSNBC reversed or that way but that's not the point I couldn't tell the story without mentioning her name\nShe says that GOP senators are behaving as if it's their time of the month\nNow\nThat to me he goes a little deeper than what it just sounds like you're on the surface\n\nImagine a conservative saying on MSNBC the female Democrat senators were being so emotional\nAlmost hysterical behaving is if it's their time of the month does anybody think that would fly there is no way\nA male commentator anywhere can say that about women senators are women witnesses or any of us sort but here's Jennifer Ruben\nIn two thousand six game that they would not forget that\nAnd if they would realize the need to continue\nTo vote in ways that would continue to support and unable Trump to be successful\nAnd she makes the point that it doesn't work that way sadly\nThat after a single election with the known result something needs to happen besides just another election of party members or Trump is not on the ballot something needs to happen to make those people as eager to vote two years later as they did in two thousand sixteen\nAnd that\nIs the Kavanaugh circumstance in her mind the conservative populist coalition\nThat elected Trump needed something outside of Trump to coalesce around in them in terms\nOf the words in her study of things just continuing to vote for a Party Republicans to enable Trump to keep going was not enough to get them out there\nDon't know why\nI Would think it would be but she says it's not Kavanaugh however has provided the capitalist because of how Trump voters that per se and specifically the conservative populists coalition perceive the way he's been treated not just by Democrats but by the media and by Hollywood\nThat the Trump conservative populace coalition is tired and worn out\nThe way they edit things they believe in are treated by Democrats the media and Hollywood and her point is that\nThe targets of range had somewhat diminished until cabinet came along and re awaken these people and fired them back up\nSo she says this is what I see in a nutshell what happened to Kavanaugh has served as a reminder Anna highlights\nTo the people voted for Trump why he's successful that it's all about being strong it help remind voters why they supported him\nAnd the other Republican president would have walked away from Kevin all by now\nEnergy would have been lost but it's not energy is high now that's again that Salinas Ito and her analysis of the electorate today\nHeading into the two thousand sixteen or two thousand Eighteen midterms now where I Will she knows what she's talking about I find it strange that people who I think the people who voted for Trump are deeply involved with things\nNow maybe there are some exceptions and you have some people to vote for Trump to just set up with Republicans and Democrats in sound trumpet interesting but for the most part I Am of the opinion that Trump voters did so for very very very specific reasons related to Trump's agenda which he\nPounded every day multiple times a day Donald Trump told everybody when he was going to do\nShould rebuild a military bring back the economy I Would think people that voted for Trump knew that that's what he's going to do and I would also think that people who voted for Trump would realize that he needs more than two years to do it\nBut is her insistent know that kinda stuff it evaporates and wanes you know people's lives go on the news changes but the this Kavanaugh circus has re ignited the coalition that elected Trump\nAnd this is to the detriment of the Democrats or don't see this happening\n\nShe says the Senate could indeed say a red wave the house she's not so sure of I found it interesting analysis and I I'm One of his share it with you\nShe

year driving around I mean it might be legitimate to ask why does the Chinese spy actually your spy\n\nLet me put it in a different did Feinstein know that he was a spy and and that's why he was there\nI don't know I'm just tells you we we haven't been again subjected to a gigantic\nReal life Netflix drama this thing has been scripted it has been choreographed and he has been rehearsed it had\nAn objective failed and this was the reason we're learning all this the objective was for cabinet to withdraw\nThey thought that they would get Kavanaugh so intimidated and making him think that all of this was so futile that in order to spare himself this assault he would withdraw his\nNomination ... that the ... that the Trump would withdraw so F disparate him the embarrassment they miscalculated both\nSo now we've had a procedural vote we're going to have a real Senate confirmation vote tomorrow on a totally manufactured written and I'm sure it's been tested\nScript\nWith the

witnessing that's a cabinet officer I guess my friends and family say hey you should run for political office after that there's no way\nBecause being deployed several times the standard ... would be to accuse me of war crime\nNow rush it or not there so it's not I'm not going to present a problem with a solution and here's this solution after Supreme Court justice Kavanaugh get settled and file lander charged with again sweat snake Ramirez board and any other activists liberal slander\nFor the new standard will be\nGuilty until proven innocent and I can tell you this right now my military brothers and sisters have not hot\nAnd dry for that sort of write for this country\nDamn right that\nIs exactly right I don't think Kavanaugh would be able to sue them I don't think that uh once you start getting into the government government officials and so forth the\nPentagon or you've got the first amendment which protects political speech and you can produce an ad that says pretty much anything you can lie about whoever and whatever you want and there's not much you can do about it\nThe the uh the remedy for that is more speech which in this case equals more money to counter the lives that\nAre being told I saw frustrating thing that drives a lot of average people out of politics even to the point of not voting or not caring 'cause they think\nWhy should I I I don't know who's telling the truth probably nobody is I Can't keep track of it any way is not worth me the banks did it causes it causes a lot of people will do now but this is causing people to tune in I Wish there were a a remedy\nFor this because it is\nAll of what you said slanderous in libel is a but there isn't there isn't any recourse you know the it's the old saw successes the sweetest revenge I'm telling you this folks I think you ought to be prepared I let's let's\nDo a little hypothetical let's presume that it's tomorrow at five thirty the votes over and Kavanaugh's confirmed ... asks you a question do you think\nThat the Democrats in the Senate the Democrats in the media meaning the media\nDo you think all of these deranged psychologically out of whack protesters are just gonna say well we gave our best shot we'll wait till they nominate somebody else and try to destroy them or do you think that they will continue in their effort\nTo wipe Kavanaugh out and destroy him\nBelieve me shoes door number too especially if these clowns when the house they are going to immediately amount to things impeachment of Trump and therefore impatient Kavanaugh\nTrump shouldn't have been there in the first wife than his nominee shouldn't be either this is not\nGoing away there's only one way that it might there was only one way that it might\nAnd it's a huge long shot and it does this end by All right my all that is just my all with a world in which God this is president\nThe Democrats ought to have their rear ends handed to them and these upcoming elections by all the ... just by all that's decent they ought to be wiped out this ought to be the biggest mid term landslide defeat any party has ever experienced\nThis party deserves to be punished at the ballot box like no party ever has\nAnd in a decent unjust world that's exactly what happened what happened and yes\nRight now the Democrats are expecting this gigantic blue wave where they're going to win the house and pillows is already talking about being speaker\nThere even dabbling about the possibility of winning the Senate and then they're telling everybody what they're going to do and I'm telling you better if they do when both those you better get as much active enjoyment\nOut of our current economy and your current liberty and freedom as you can because they are going to start immediately erasing it by raising taxes\nRaising corporate taxes committing this country to all kinds of worldwide climate change garbage\nThat is going to redirect American resources\nThere are going to reenact the Obama agenda and they're going to put it on steroids and that'll mean wiping out all of these trade deals all of these new jobs the Democrats want government to be front and center in everybody's life they want every voter to think whatever they have\nCame from government came from Democrats it didn't come from you it doesn't come from your hard work it doesn't cover yourself reminds it comes from them and you're gonna learn it and love it and live at by golly by gosh or else you're gonna be punished\nThis party deserves to be sold soundly defeated in November that we haven't seen anything like it if they lose if they do not win the house if they do not win the Senate if they lose seats in both then that might\nMake some of the leaders of the party\n\nReef think their current strategy but if they win based on this it's going to get even worse than it's been this\nPolitics of personal destruction is going to be amplified and every Republican it's going to be targeted and every political media opponent is
