think Susan Collins was the turning point no Susan Collins was not the turning point Susan Collins speech didn't change any votes but she did something far more important than the votes Robert cast by the time she gave her speech on friday afternoon she did something\nFar more important than that which will discuss is the program unfolds now what turned this was Trump\nTrump in his rally where he was accused of mocking Dr Ford you didn't mock Dr Ford didn't imitate her he didn't make fun of her\nHe's simply repeated the truth of her testimony she doesn't know who what when where why she doesn't know how she doesn't know when she wearing happened what floor second floor what ruins she didn't know any of that\nThe reason that was important is because nobody reads the drive by media know any of that in the hearings Christine Ford's assertions were not challenged\nSo in the broad based media coverage of the hearings the fallacies and the on provable allegations in her testimony were never brought up\nSo the average Joe blow out there never knew that she couldn't identify where it happened when it happened how she got home who took her home what happened afterwards she couldn't even identify a year or next month\nThey didn't notice they didn't know that everybody she placed in the room failed\nTo corroborate what she said the average Joe blow reading the average drive by media didn't know that until Donald Trump pointed out that was the turning point and that's why the media turned on Trump or this for mocking her because Trump gave up the ghost\nTrump's spill the beans on what they were trying to hide and the rest of the drive by media and it was a turning point for public opinion make no mistake\nRush Limbaugh making radio rain again you're

very essence the modern day Americans left as taught and educated over the past two generations through middle school high school and college\nHas been taught to hate America because America is unjust from our founding days because it was founded by white men\nAnd white men found a place for themselves and exploded everybody else and everybody else has been getting the short end of the stick for over two hundred plus years\nAnd only now is the awareness insensitivity to this day and realized only now are the victims of this white privilege\nOf this white power only now are they standing up and demanding to be heard only now are there are rising up in a righteous indignation and demanding fairness and redress\nAnd the only way that can happen is for the white power structure white privilege\nTo be destroyed and replaced by a coalition of all of those who have been victimized\nSegregated punished\nMistreated abused what have you Byron them reclaiming or not reclaiming but claiming what is just lay there\nAnd that is America and its political systems and that's what young people have been taught and now as as evidenced by that column I wrote by read by Alexis Grinnell

you have to have to it\nYou after it came to the bullying which has happened on gay marriage it's happened on transgender bathroom issues it's happened on every oddball leftist culture will demand out

allies and a special counsel with an unlimited budget sixteen or Seventeen Trump behaving lawyers slash investigators and still\nNothing because there has been pushed back when there is push back on

[noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] Mm\nSome Babylon me as a conservative satire sight I being inundated with people leaving for me that it's not only great that it's\nChristian and it's filled with people of white privilege so we heartily endorse the Babylon me any whether it's their points\nProves my point about humor in satire foreign to be true in funny it must have an element of truth in it\nAnd it does at the Democratic party is very much aware that they cannot and do not implement their beliefs via Congress here is David in Phoenix as we head back to the phones appreciate your patience sir hello\nHi rush is truly an honor to speak with you I Wish you could live forever and be on the airwaves for ever\nAnd I took her thank you very much\nI'm just a quick question for you um you know I think that the senators knew they weren't going to get the votes\nOf the Democrat senators that is to oppose Kevin are and make make sure he's not on the bench and the Supreme Court so I was wondering [noise] um do you think that the way they framed him with the media is something they're going to use later on to frame the entire Supreme\nCourt when they don't get their way bingo\nSimply because they are capable in fact [noise]\nLet's see if there's actually a story with that exact point made here and I think I moved to the bottom of the stack but it is it is a woman making the point that Kavanaugh\nIs as good as guilty because he could have done it and he could have done it because he's a man he could have done it\nBecause he has male genitalia that's all this woman in this story requires to believe ball the Ford that Kevin ... could have done it well if you're old woman with the sons and a husband that you love and some brothers and you're watching this you wouldn't miss\nWhat is transpiring that men are automatically guilty all it takes is an allegation the obligation doesn't require any evidence in fact the fact that there is no evidence adds to the fact that the allegation is likely to have happened\nBecause that's what men do be cause man can\nAnd men can because they have the genitalia necessary to do it I don't know if you're an average ordinary decent woman watching this stuff how in the world you want to sign onto that well you don't\nAnd so now these leftist women are enraged when they have discovered that they failed to persuade\nA bunch of average ordinary white women to join their cause anti Kevin Ball so now these women are sellouts\nAnd their ... says are sellouts and their rooms are cello and they're selling out to the patriarchy and as such they become worthless and even the liability to the point now that here we have a soundbite with two women experts in gender studies saying\nDo we need white women get to the electoral question every candidate needs to ask let me remind you in November of two thousand eleven the Obama presidential campaign this was written about by a Thomas and so all in the Washington Post\nMight have been to New York times\nOn nouns that they were for going the white working class\nAs a voting bloc and instead we're going to put together a winning coalition of a sum total of every\nMinority group they can find they were going to combine all these minority groups and make that the Democrat base because white working class voters were becoming less and less\nDependable because they weren't buying Obama an Obamacare and because of that they were becoming racist a traditional Democrat little guy voting bloc they\nIt's rational interest this is simply an evolution of that\nSo while the white working class was totally go pounds of sand by the Obama campaign two thousand eleven now in two thousand Eighteen\nDo we need white women get to the electoral questioned it every candidate needs to ask ... folks illnesses now under misunderstand what I'm doing here I'm not doing this simply to express in the credibility of this\nDoing this under the auspices of how in the world can a majority or mainstream of Americans in any way support this party\n\nI realize I'm setting myself up here for what might be a major shocking disappointment the day after the election in November and I'm not making any predictions here I'm just\nI'm I'm I'm genuinely curious\n\nI just don't see how the actions the words the policy is the attempts to inspire and persuade I just I don't see how any decent normal people fall for this\n\nAnd I realize that Democrats have educated a lot of people in the last two generations I realize a lot of college educated people have come out of these institutions that may have been corrupted and polluted with this crap\nAnd since most people are not what they wish they were most people are not as successful as they ... want to be\nMost people do think about what they don't have rather than what they do\nAnd if that's who you are if that's if that's the personality type that it's not very big step to start blaming somebody else for what you don't have becomes very easy to blame some faceless patriarchy some faceless white privilege power structure some faceless Montreal mean ease\nDepriving you denying you discriminating against you\n\nSaw the left has to do is get hold of the people who have not amount to do what they want to now to do they have what they had hoped to have it anyway materially professionally you name it the other words it's not hard to run onto unhappy people it's not challenging to find a bunch of people that are\nMeeting themselves up and all you have to do is ... is is convinced those people that somebody else\nDid it to the Republicans but white privilege power structured did it too and there's only one way to fix it and that's the wipe 'em out I Know they've educated a lot of people to believe this now anyway back to the phones we go in a moment just saw the clock QuickTime out back with more\nAfter the view among them millions of people who'd been hearing a lot about Rush Limbaugh
