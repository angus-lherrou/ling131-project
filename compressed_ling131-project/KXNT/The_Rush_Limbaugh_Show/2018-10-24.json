for mentioning Bob Ford it really is one of the finest guys anybody could ever meet\n[noise] ah I look at the psychology of people\nAnd I'm not a trained psychologist but I Am fairly experienced here

them by way of elections they really really resented and they resent the people who made it happened which are the voters\nSo today's American leftist angry as it can be at people who voted for Trump the hatred for Trump is actually directed at hatred for people who elected him and compounding hatred when those people will not abandon them the left is making every every effort it can\nTo distance

whenever they want they are able to do it and if not take them out damage them tremendously\nBut they haven't been able to even score on Trump salt they began this movement of promoting\nThe media that there was going to be a blue wave they created this movement based on the fact they they created a whole cloth something that does not exist on national attitude of hatred for Donald Trump\nThey simply took their own attitude and they transferred it to a majority of Americans for all intents and purposes and they began reporting the news that way\nEverybody hates Trump now that they've seen trauma naturally hate him to despising they regret voting for him they wish they could get their vote back that became the narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hide things blue wave\nThat it was the only commonsense view and a half now that now the\nAnd the narrative that's been the narrative for two years that narrative is what led them to hyping this blue wave\nThat it was the only common sense to be able to have now that now that people have seen trumping action they've seen is bad manners they've seen whatever is about in the left have now everybody's seen it now they regret it now they can't wait to get rid of Trump every special election every Democrat was going to win it because why everybody hated Trump and everybody hated themselves were voting for him\nWell it isn't coming to pass\nThe blue wave they said the existed maybe never has the blue wave based on people who hate Trump now they've seen him in action can't wait to vote against them now weren't learning much of that was made up much of that with soap opera scripted media narrative\nNow we're getting down to the nitty gritty now or two weeks away from the

as he looks at things here is an absolute red\nWave and he did not believe this until last night he's been seeing trends the past two weeks but he has been reluctant to convert into these transiting with actual prediction until now\nHe says the numbers he's looking at from Nevada are exceptional in Minnesota Keith Ellison is crazy ring the whole Democratic Party now Amy ... is in a seven point race she was not too long ago in a in a\nIn a landslide victory situation that\nWas so secure and that she wasn't even going to have to spend any money now her lead is down to seven how sleep is only down three the governor's race two points and Allison Keith Ellison who is crater ring looks like he's going to lose by more than seven points\nAnd this guy says he's getting reports him on the ground in Minneapolis and throughout the state that Randy\nAreas are turning out in droves once again Republican early voting is through the roof and nobody predicted this\nThe Democrats own early voting and the Republicans so far\nOn it and\nAll over the country it looks like and this was a stunt or this is something people have not seen and nobody predicted\nThis in\nNevada Dean Heller now on track to win by thirty five thousand votes California thirty nine California forty eight California forty nine abs and tease all three\nSeats would be safe Antonio Sabato is up or two points in his district of California is even got places pockets\nWhere Republicans are looking good Arizona Republicans up over Democrats twelve point four percent\nA that's\nA three point nine percent over two thousand sixty in the uh Arizona won a Democrat seat is now close all of these thought to be Democrats locks just a month ago are now toss ups\nAnd this guy says to me I think we're in a position here to actually gain a couple of house seats maybe seven to nine Senate seats at this rate if these kinds of trends and it's all based on polling data continues\nNow you might be Russia was this guy right here in this anywhere I Know you're not hearing it anywhere that's the point\nWhere it doesn't matter what is the fact that I'm really laying it to you is all you need to know that that that I'm taking it

beginning to pull back from that now even they are beginning to admit that there isn't one and it could be big trouble um NBC Wall Street Journal poll Politico these kinds of places are pulling back from it I don't think there ever was going to be a blue wave this is my point I think we've been lied to we've had a\nMedia soap opera narrative that has been part of the effort to defeat Trump at Republicans for the last year starting with a generic ballots last December so uh it it but regardless however the Democrats are telling a story themselves however they're lying or whatever it isn't\nIt isn't unfolding as they expected they expected to be able to make a blue wave happen just by predicting it just by talking about it just by reporting stories made to look like it was

falls could be missing a Republican syringe\nHere's why certainly looks like Democrats will do well in the midterms but this cycle present some unusual risks\nFor pollsters now that the mainstream media does this every election cycle where it was all this down for the last six months for the last six months there was going to be a blue wave and there was no doubt about it it was going to sweep the Democrats do massive control of the house of representatives and the Senate and it was by by Trump\nAnd that's been the the soap operas script for at least nine months\nDrive buys a shoring everybody every day Democrats are going to crush it yeah it's gonna be curtains for Trump curtains for the Republicans now polls could be missing a GOP surge\nThe polls are telling there is a big way based on the generic ballot they believe that they get it in their heads and they believe it and they start reporting it and it just compounds itself and it becomes even more intensely believed it becomes gospel\nAnd then it doesn't\nAnd then the things that are supposed to mend it like that Kavanaugh trek backfires and these mobs are back firing they are not achieving their objectives\nSo if you flipped this around you've got this you've got this this this mob of people flooding the border by intention\nThere's no way that helps the Democrats don't and the Democrats as I said let me grab the let me grab the up was tweets here it's really strange ladies and gentlemen I'm going to quote the creepy porn star a lawyer but Here's Michael ...\nThere is too much at stake in the mid term shut the Democrats do allow the Republicans to use this caravan which is so obviously is set up as a wedge issue it is time for the Democrats the step up and be strong on border security we cannot\nOnce again be painted as weak and then lose\nThere is a translation for this in addition to what are you saying here you'd Democrats have got to stop up posing Trump just to oppose Trump's so here's a caravan\nHere's a mob of people that are illegal immigrants that have all kinds of bad actors in them and now we know this to be true and now we we know from a couple of sources that Venezuela\nSponsored and pay for it is if that if that's true then Venezuela also means Iran and the ...\nFolks a\nLot of people in our size have jumped say George Soros yeah maybe but if in Mike Pence says it's Venezuela some other people are saying as Venezuela if it's Venezuela it's also Iran and the ... regardless\nThis mob of people storming the American border there's no reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates in let those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not worthy\nNo reasonable Americans wants to just open the floodgates unless those people in for whatever else is going to follow behind this is not one of the American people are right now\nThe only common sense a cool thing to do is to oppose this but because Trump opposes that the Democrats instinctively have to say they're in favor of it they are that demanded what ever Trump is for they're going to be against whatever Trump is against therefore ... saying come on you guys\nStep up and be strong on border security this doesn't help us\nA mob of seven thousand ten thousand people starving engaged demanding to be let in\nThat doesn't help us\nWhat happened to you and say oh this is doing is illustrating what we support on a day to day trickle kind of basis and the American people are opposed to it\n[noise] my point is [laughter] none of this is panning out the way it was planned no blue wave I ...\nDon't misunderstand I don't know what's good I'm not saying that the Democrats may not win the house but\nI I don't think they're going to [noise] I I'm sticking with the production I made on the Hannity show last Thursday night I Do not see it because I never fall for left wing media conventional wisdom or the standard ordinary groupthink narrative of the moment whenever it is\nBut it's more than that there's nothing happening in America right now that argue is electing Democrats\nNot in mass maybe individual race here district based on local things but in mass\nThere is no reason to vote Democrat even giving people reasons to vote for the all they're trying to do is get people to say no to Republicans say no to Trump because Trump's what he's aboard he tweets he's a bad guy is whatever whatever is\nThe stunts the Democrats are pulling destroying Kevin on his family sending rice in what looked like rice and the Susan Collins all these monsters nothing the Democrats are doing\nThat's the kind of thing you do to build a movement in a decent society and I still believe that we have one\nI Believe are decent society is under siege everyday are decent society standard good old normalcy is under assault everyday led by pop culture and left us in Hollywood\nIn Silicon valley and the drive by media we're under assault every day but they have not overturned it yet they have not gotten to the point where in decency an abnormality have replaced normal\nThere's just nothing out there to me that would have people excited about voting for Democrats because the the even the Democrats are not pushing that they're trying to get people to vote against Trump against Republicans\nUh I just I don't see it we'll find out if my instincts are off the charts you're not in less than a couple of weeks but my point is the Democrats don't see it happening and that's what really matters they're the ones panicking so you flip this scenario

they are the kinds of people that everybody in town\nVeers looks up to in the old days everybody would be proud of it\nThat everybody in town\n... looks up to in the old days everybody would be proud

and Ted Cruz and I can go on\nAnd it may be that will do some comparisons here as the election nears\nBut it's um it's just it's it's the difference to me are striking and it it's nice kind of racism\nYou you look at how close the Democrats are making some of these and in others the Republicans are pulling away but it is striking how far gone and how lost the Democratic\nParty has taken the people who support them I mean it's a hodgepodge of people that have given up\nAnd become victims and blame everybody else including the country for what ever is going wrong in their lives and they

kinda [noise] couldn't handle the Republicans anymore it's a shame to she so she was so good she was so bright\nEyed just something that's happening to people in that town when Trump shows up and it's just it's causing them to make fools of themselves here's what Trump said yesterday in the oval office Trump speaking with reporters during the Q and a a\nA ... uh what what what not no [noise] uh [noise]\nThey've gotten out of myself or da da da da da da\nDe ... out of a [noise] here it is it's never tan here's Trump in Washington over or off as a White House correspondent Jim I kept seeing it and so this is before the bomb\nCenter follow up on your comments about being a nationalist there's a concern that you're sending coded language or dog whistles just some Americans out there who are not ... in your signaling the euro one of them like a white nationalist what are you saying then that\nTrauma her the theory about being severed them all when I was somebody that loves our country proud of her country and I am a nationalist is a word that has the news too much but I've heard that I think that you wrote that somebody that wants to help other countries of the world [noise]\nBut I also have to say we have to think of a bull I Want our country is to be treated well to be treated with respect for many years other countries that are allies of us so they have not read it for our country fairly [noise] so in that sense I Am absolutely and that was rather\nYou know I this is this is so easy this is so not a controversy this is such a microcosm this is is such a teachable moment this is exactly\nWhy the American left and the media have no idea who Donald Trump is\nAnd they can't even relate to it here's a guy who does nothing but love America and that\nIs something they can't relate to loving America to them is old fashioned it's a bygone era right in this era of globalism loving your company's fine but but it seems so old fashioned\nAnd it's it's it's just pass say it\nSo it's so foreign to these people they just there really isn't even a common ground with\nThem on that Donald Trump\nLet me share with the way my brother David tweeted on this yesterday and there's probably a good way to say and he said Trump believes in a strong exceptional America he's not a political scientist\nHe doesn't speak\nCode he doesn't offer dog whistles you don't even\nNot a political scientist he doesn't speak in code he doesn't offer dog whistles you don't even know what this stuff is when\nHe says I'm a nationalist he's not winking at neo Nazis he's not\nWinking at white supremacists and say we're patriots and UPC people he's just a guy who loves America he's a nationalist versus global must\nHe's going to make America great again he believes America deserves to be great he believes in America weeds in the world when it's great\nBut these people are but they're supposedly the intellectuals\nThere the broad minded because they're so small minded and tiny minded that they can't get past their hatred rooted in partisanship and all they had his knee jerk reactions on Trump's has is a nationalist\nThey immediately hear a dog whistle yeah Trump's talking to the people in Charlottesville that's what they're thinking\nThat Trump is winking at the people in Charlottesville the Nazis and there you go guys you go that's they honestly think and if they don't honestly think that they're doing it doubled disservice because they're trying to make people to follow them believe they do think that\nIf they do think that they're the ones I have an electrical problems if they do think if they cannot understand the simplicity\nOf I Love America I Want America to be the best it can be America the best it can be makes the world the best if if they don't understand that if that doesn't compute with them than they have\nNo business being positions of power in this country because they're not going to accurately represent loss or this nation's interest\n'cause this is not complicated it is such a cheap lazy reaction to say\nSee the Trump Hitler nationalist dog\nWhistle there's no basis in fact for it there's still\nEngaged in trying to convince Trump or are they convince people to hate Trump the way they do\nI'm just going to tell people\nYou you're ... if you don't learn to understand this you're going to ever be ... at the guy's ankles\nLoves America\nThinks America is great and can be greater and a great America is great for everybody in it and a great America is made great my great\nCitizens and if there's nothing wrong with loving America there's nothing wrong with thinking America is exceptional and exceptional America solve the problems of the world and exceptional America it creates an economy that is capable of providing prosperity\nFor hundreds of millions of people there isn't another form of government that can even come close\nSocialism can't communism can't by definition at camp socialism communism produced wealth for the leaders by stealing it from the people who created\nAnd that's your Obama's and your Hillary's and pick any Democrat running for president in twenty twenty and a bunch of I'm running for reelection this time around\nWhat do you people not understand how absolutely ... seat lazy if is to say that a guy his simply trying to describe how he loves the country is a freaking Nazi\nYou really think people are going to sign up with that in a rebirth that when there is not a sin pillar\nOf the evidence\nGuys are closer to Hitler and not to not see ism national socialism is a
