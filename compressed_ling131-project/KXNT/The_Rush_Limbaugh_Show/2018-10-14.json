process the hidden wealth\nSolution and I want to share with you that two biggest boomer concerns that ended up becoming the two biggest boomer retirement success techniques\nIn fact it really comes down to the reality of this there are two types of taxpayers and there are two types of retirement accounts\nSo let's get into this boomers two biggest concerns and I'm going to start with number one is having especially in light of what just happened a stock market protection plan\nC ... my story is simple and I'm not talk to you how to get a complementary copy of my most recent book the baby boomer retirement breakthrough where I teach you my story see I was a I was somebody that got greedy as um buffet with say be greedy when others are fearful but fearful and others are greedy and I I'm mixed that equation up\nAnd ended up being a victim of the tech boom and bust the last time the tech bubble hit\nAnd unfortunately people lost on average eighty percent on the NASDAQ being heavily into tech mutual funds or stocks\nAnd what I learned from that experience all that many years ago was that I always had the proper financial foundation for our family in structures that really only the ultra wealthy had ever really heard about\nBecause I became a student of finding a superior alternative\nThan just following the crowd you see and that's the concern today because if we look at what's happening history is likely repeating itself especially being this far into this next bull or what some people are arguing to be the longest Bull Run in stock market\nHistory in fact ah the headline said All right the markets fear index just exploded upwards of stocks around the world plummeted that was Business Insider\nBecause volatility is returning to the stock market in a big way back yesterday's a drop in the Dow eight hundred and thirty one points was the fourth largest single day drop in the Dow Jones stock market history\nAnd none of them are when I asked them about how you can have upside double digit potential returns with no downside exposure or they wanted to classify that as an annuity and said well those those ... are kept like three or four percent growth focused not annuity\nSo she said I'm so glad I took the time to investigate it through your educational process and here's the opportunity to go to retirement protected dot com\nThat's retirement protected dot com and register it's a a complementary log on to learn educational Web and are in fact the first fifty people who register I Want to an end of ten I Want to give you my most recent book the baby boomer retirement breakthrough route teach you the five greatest Trapster retirement\nUp teach you what the flu and have done\nBy having the court for success criteria that we find most Ninety nine out of a hundred people about Ninety seven out of a hundred people don't have that they learn and I'll be teaching that this Tuesday now if you prefer you can simply call\nEight five five six six eight to nine to eight that's eight five five six six eight to nine to eight but you've got to hurry I teach all over the country and there's different time zone so be sure to reserve the time zone that works best in your schedule well space is still available\nYou know inclined to share last week the sitting you know I'm so glad I took the time to investigate how to insulate our savings from losing to the market again or to unnecessary taxes\nFolks believe in better you worked hard for your retirement retire your risk and get peace of mind planning in place when we come back from this break I'm going to teach you the difference between indexing in investing and I talk to you about a couple\nOf your neighbors other boomers that have said at least a quarter million or more towards retirement that have the two biggest concerns that will come back and talk about retirement protected dot com retirement protected dot com oh\nShucks we realized was your plan gives us peace of mind because we have and I guarantee you never lose money I guess the market a gym\nThat means security threats aren't count girl taxi and we can act as our money what more can you if you want to\nCheck on the verge of ... well Lucian looking your\nRetirement on track retirement protected dot com that's retirement protected dot com [noise]\nIf you'd like to protect yourself from taxes inflation market losses and economic uncertainty you're doomed to the right place malefactor jumped all over and hidden wealth radio\nI'm Charles Oliver welcome to hidden wealth Radiohead if you're just joining us all of our radio shows are archived at hidden wealth radio dot com hey we've been talking about the boomers\nThe biggest success techniques that we have found that ultimately I've learned from the flu and the highly paid politicians to\nHigh income earners all the way the Big Ten football coaches that were just discussed in the ah the media this last week about putting two million into a strategy that has upside with no downside\nSo you have a Florida protection and which is what we call indexing but you money only participates when the market goes up\nWith double digit potential returns but does not participate when the market goes down and folks this has been part of our family's financial foundation now for well over Twenty years because I'm somebody likely like many of you listening that knows what it feels like to lose money and in light of what's happened just this last week\nWhere many people took a three percent tumble just in one day this last mid week day the fourth largest single point drop in our stock market history just transpired this last week\nAnd as the headlines read which I again this isn't a fear tactic this is just to educate people CNBC reporter this last week there's more pain to come for stocks according to analysts are watching the charts\nCNBC also said they're warning signs of a big market sell off was coming and investors believe there's more to go Amazon and a Facebook plummeted stocks a tech stocks recorded their worst day in seven years this past Wednesday and the folks the list goes\nAnd on and on\nAnd it it's not good news because again what what's the reality here let's review the facts were nine and a half years into the longest Bull Run and stock market history\nRight no bull markets ever made it to its tenth birthday in the last time right that the second longest bull market being fueled by the dot com boom and then unfortunately the rally went bust in the nineties caused investors to lose nearly eighty percent folks I'm One of them\nI'm somebody that I'm going to teach you indexing versus investing that anchor down our families find financial foundation and praise the lord I we had that but at the same time I got greedy as Warren Buffet talks about I did the opposite I he says be greedy when others are fearful but be fearful when others are greedy\nAnd I took too much risk and it it prompted all those years ago\nAre experiencing the loss of some of our families money into studying what the flu and the ultra wealthy have done for years and this is an interesting statistic that many people that I've had the opportunity to educate I'm not just a best selling author or national radio educator I'm somebody that\nHas written several books a two time best selling author and it all came from ... things that I've learned from other people and then by applying these techniques and showing people how these techniques can work in conjunction with one another enables folks to discovered uncover their various areas of hidden wealth\nThe typically reside in the two biggest threat to the boomers which ended up being the two biggest success techniques and that is a limit ... stock market crashes\nAnd eliminating unnecessary taxes\nTo getting rid of the crashes in taxes folks is not that difficult in other words having a stock market protection plan any unnecessary not to pay tax savings plans\nAnd it's all done through using the tax code right judge hands several years ago said there's two types of of of taxes are in this country tax payers I should say that he says there in this country the informed than the uninformed\nRight however both are legal\nFolks this is not deceptive tax evasion this strategic tax\nAvoidance it's teaching people how to grow money without ...\nIs there money without tax and transfer it without tax that say savings in itself but protecting yourself from this market volatility that I Believe is back right to lose eight hundred and thirty two points in one day this past week being the fourth largest single point drop in our stock markets history\nIs giving people the riding on the wall with many people predicting this happening well before now I myself have been teaching people how to get ... they're serious retirement savings anger down and secured to not not just lock lose\nBut folks it's called lock in and reset so let me spending just a minute on this for you because this may be one of the biggest breakthroughs the boomers have shared\nThat I'll be teaching this coming Tuesday\nOr more specifically that I Want you to be able to learn more about right people don't have is one clients that ... we don't have the time\nTo go through another major market meltdown we we do not have the time to recover\nAnd of course folks that's the big concern right but many people are caught off guard by these unnecessary taxes\nSo let me teach you just a couple of quick techniques then I'll be teaching more about an in depth and detail this coming Tuesday lock in reset it's a unique provision in in the engineering of how to to to structure your savings\nThat you're going to build a structured cash flow of of secure retirement income from so that you don't run out of money before you run out of life\nAnd the strategy is very simple as the market goes up your money isn't in the daily ups and downs and all around the stock market right especially with all this volatility but ironically the volatility itself\nActually makes this strategy better now I Know that sounds kind of odd or counterintuitive so how can volatility helped me Chuck well let's let's think about this\nWhen when the market has again our clients lock in that game never at risk of giving net gain back\nWhich is not what anybody else has I can assure you [laughter] I I I personally sit with clients on a weekly basis and and I can't believe nor can they the exposure that they start to realize they have by some of our software analysis one just the other day would would lose fifty five percent of another oh wait market crash hits\nAnd they can't afford that is no one could it but if the same time when there's again it's locked in huge peace of mind sleeping better no worry right and when the market does lose there's the floor of protection\nSo it's a lock in but here's the key the reset so if the S. and P. today let's say sell a thousand points\nAre clients don't lose they lock in any prior games not at risk of giving them back and then they get the advantage of the index that they're tracking only games not losses to to reset at the lowest point\nTo start their next game right so in other words if the S. and P. loses a thousand points the folks have to wait for that thousand points to be made back before they start in a new game our client start their new gained from the lowest level forward\nFolks that is huge that's a way to out Fox Wall Street and how we've been getting that done and helping clients secure they're serious retirement savings for over two decades now\nHere's the things I I Want to teach you this coming Tuesday so for those that have saved at least two hundred thousand or more are typically between the ages of forty five and Seventy five I don't care if you're getting to retirement or you're getting through retirement you can improve you can increase this isn't about playing it safe\nAh he calls it instead of Murphy's law his last name as the last thing you know as soon as I sense that things are good I can see the market going bad this is the climate lost fifty percent twice between two thousand one two thousand two that was one or two and then again between two thousand eight and early two thousand nine\nAnd he said you know I Can't afford to do that and folks he's right you know this is a client\nA wife or he and his wife are in their mid to late sixties between the two of them and the reality is they don't have time to make up for another two thousand and eight or two thousand to two thousand and two market debacle\nAnd many people are predicting even the great Warren Buffet that it's not a matter of if\nIt's a matter of when and when is unfortunately going to cause what some are even claiming to be the worst recession or the worst economic downturns in their lifetime and these are folks that are talking about this that are well respected on Wall street that have been doing what they're they've been doing now for forty years\nFolks look here's here's the importance of this point right and I and I think this is this is key the the top retirement solutions that others miss is the tax peace\nThis is the tax piece impact us all heavens no it doesn't impact us all because a lot of people haven't ... due to this retirement crisis it's been proven with all the polls are a lot of people haven't saved appropriately\nFor retirement and they're going to be in big trouble we talked about the pyramid right the pyramid back in the day for a lot of us thinking about our parents or grandparents retirement\nWas very simple a a good solid foundation of that\nAnd ... than it was our Social Security and the little peek at the top of the pyramid was money that we could generate off of our savings will now you've got to take that pyramid and in standard on it's on it's on its ear because now it's the opposite\n[noise] now we need the majority very little is coming from pensions\nAnd then of course Social Security is obviously been restricted with low cost of living adjustments the threat of a being cut Twenty one percent within technically the next\nRoughly Fifteen to Twenty years and the fact that most people went from a defined benefit pension paid by the employer to a ... defined contribution plan which is what I call the yo yo plan which stands for your on\nYour own right you eat what you kill what you put away is what you're going to get to draw from and that's what's causing a lot of people to not be able to retire or retire with a lifestyle that they had envisioned\nAnd the good as as it doesn't have to be that way folks but the harsh reality is we're on our own for the majority of you listening and I know this by having a front row seat with baby boomers now for going on to a quarter century right twenty three to twenty four years we're in and have had a front row seat with boomers and have learned the very real things\nThat it prevented boomers from having an optimal retirement and here here's what they are some of these are basic but we're going to get into the specifics number one even forks had a great article that said the number one thing that's preventing people from having the retirement that they could have is number one having a plan\nThat one seems pretty common sense right having a plan I just talked to two clients this last week and by the way I'm not just a a best selling author or radio educator I'm someone with my wealth architecture team that takes on a certain number of clients each and every year all over the United states and I can tell you\nThe reality is these particular clients who said you know what we've never had a full fledged plan some of them said we've never had a plan and many of them said in particular two of them this past week we've never taken the time to actually do a budget Chuck in your budget woke us up what I call a lifestyle\nIncome budget that is in other words not just the essentials but the wants to travel more to do more while you can see your grand kids as they grow up and they said you know what we had no idea we have that much money going out with folks that's the that's the real first step\nThe second step is then implementing a plan\nThe third step in probably the most crucial the Forbes article went on to say was then managing the plan for further optimization so here's what I Want to encourage you the importance ... more so probably than ever before in my career I'm seeing is the investigation\nInto the optimization of an actual full fledged holistic comprehensive whatever you want to call it planned that incorporates tax strategy solutions to save tax folks because as much as an for these tax cuts somebody's going to have to pay for them\nAnd ... that somebody or those that have worked hard and it's said even harder and typically it's because they've saved and accounts that the accounts until they start drawing money out have not been taxed yet\nWhich means deferred taxes equal increased taxes because the cost of living will increase of the distribution out of those accounts will have to increase to net the higher amount and needed to spend\nBut add to the fact ... you know tax tax reform one point oh and now the passing through the house of tax reform to point out of these cuts\nIs causing massive increases to our deficit now we're seeing some positive things come from that but some of them folks are false positives the corporations cutting their tax to buy back their own stock to\nRolling it can only last so long until they run out of the ability to do the buybacks and artificially propped our market's up candle leave for about the last three years if not for\nSo it's kind of prolong the party the folks the lights are going to have to go out at some point in having a plan that not only addresses taxes but also addresses\nThe protection to the downside ride a few clients this week said you know what I really like about him well solution as you guys find tax savings in wealth strategies that other people miss\nAnd folks it it's not just seeing what people are missing it's a Dennis ... where the advantages are in the timing of having the advantages and I gotta tell ya\nOutside of the the chance of Trump getting uh unfortunately uh impeached which could make a lot of these tax cuts a timing go away very quickly\nIs the fact that they're going to expire unless this permanent tax cut gets put through but even if this permanent tax cut gets put through the reality is the tax magnitude for those that have worked the hardest and save the hardest is going to be even greater\nAnd let me make sure that you understand the the the ... the key if you don't remember anything else I share with you remember these two words shifting and timing and we'd like to see in our practice shift\nHappens but it happens as part of his strategy to a comprehensive plan other words one client I'll I'll share a couple of days with you that I thought were very impactful because the folks just didn't see it right so for example\nA client was very taken back recently because they were going to have to have eight earnings provision penalty on their Social Security benefits that they never knew they were going to have meaning over Seventeen thousand forty dollars if before for retirement age you draw your Social Security\nEvery two dollars you're over Seventeen thousand and forty dollars you basically have to give one dollar back\nThey had no idea if you've not drawn your Social Security for a full twelve months you can get a redo\nBut you've got to see what makes the most sense for you and we had another client that learned how eighty five percent of their Social Security would be taxed because of a choice of the type of pension payout that they would elect\nAs opposed to doing a lump sum roll over which would enable them strategically to avoid having eighty five percent of their Social Security taxed now here's the big one right\nOne particular client had no idea that in the new tax reform bill now the taxes are on sale maybe not permanently but at least temporarily which means take advantage of the sale while the sale last that there is a one hundred percent tax reduction\nThat can be used between now and the end of twenty twenty to that one client we met with this week we were able to move two hundred and eighty thousand dollars out of his remaining IRA and the net result is paying zero tax for those who qualify under the special provision of the code\nAnd finally we had a client who was unaware right that the legislation now that's being passed is to prevent the stretch IRA meaning\nBefore when the second spouse passes the remainder of the IRA can be passed on to the next generation and then there's an inherited required minimum distribution over their inherited age lifetime will now Congress although it's passed a hundred percent before and the Senate a few years ago which back on the chopping block\nAnd likely to be passed in a recent article that now any inherited irate money has to be fully closed out in under five years\nWhich means when people can afford the tax the least while they're making the most they are going to be forced to take a distribution that indirectly makes Uncle Sam the biggest beneficiary\nI write books I'm going to be teaching this coming Tuesday an introduction of how to ... tax the the growth of your money on tax the distribution in use of your money and untaxed the concern of leading attacks\nThe unfortunate penalty to your children and I'm going to be teaching it in a complementary educational Web and our this Tuesday and you can register well space

ever trained as a ... or jewelry or whatever [laughter] were you ever trained in Missouri was just something you picked up as a hobby\nI ... it had been a hobby since I was a little girl and when the craft of cooking I left my life over time I still enjoy it but we do it at home it's not the scale I needed to keep my hands busy and so I'm completely self taught it's amazing what you can find on YouTube now a days and uh\nJust asking questions and seeking out mentors is how it succeeded\nHow did it happen that you decided to lose his business because it's a big leap going from a hobby that you enjoy to actually making it your profession when was that decision made and how did it come about\nSo\nMy youngest son was three weeks old and I'm sure it was in a a a sleep deprived days that I looked at my husband said\nI'm so I have this idea and I I'm gonna\nI'm gonna bar a little bit of money I'm going to start the business and uh it's it's an ongoing joke between us they said I\nThink that's such a good idea [laughter] but humor make good man for it and uh the joke to this day is is whatever his gut instinct is about the jewelry business I just go completely against the grain and it works out incredibly well so he has the best business partner I could ever have\nWhen it came to producing a product\nHow did you pick a you know like the military themed unpatriotic deemed a jewelry that you do the uh the brute your broach Roach Roche I never that's all right I never wear one so I Would do but when you decide well how did you decide on that particular design was something that\nFriends had seen before that you would made and they asked about or how did you come up with the idea to focus on that specifically\nSo the tradition of approaching the military is actually generations deep um I've been working with the gal Charlene rushed in for her she did it for over Thirty years\nAnd um I ended up and purchasing her business and carrying it on and so the\nThe way the bridges that started for me as my husband taught military history\nAt the United states military academy and so he and his friends are heavily into military history makes sense and and the collectors world the pieces when they break lady the insignia ah unfortunately they're scrapping that world and so they started collecting for me\nAnd that's how I came across all these amazing center pieces for the roaches was giving history new life\nThe ... to me that's not the only thing that you made does that but that's what you started out doing was the ...\nThat's when I started doing and it um it was a very steady snowball from there and so we've got everything we're in now license you mentioned from Connecticut or the Waterbury button company only or all of the uniform buttons in Connecticut and they were just tickled to death with the jewelry so they've open an account for me now\nAnd so I work with both knew and vintage buttons all the way back to the civil war ... right and I get to travel

found that that's the main audience for your products as those who want something a little bit more upscale I Would say than just you know the the maybe up and you're going to buy a gift shop or
