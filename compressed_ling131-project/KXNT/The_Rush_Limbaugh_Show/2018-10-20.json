T. E. N. C. T. is\nGetting a lot of media attention with professional football players on and so forth so that's what we're talking about today and I'm joined by my friend Kathy Kathy are you there\n[noise] yes I Am more than how are you I'm fine how about you are doing good doing good okay so did you want to start off Kathy any questions you have on the subject\nI think the first thing we need to do is say why we're doing this broadcast\n[noise] we're doing this broadcast because\nConcussions have long been a topic of significant debate many of you know someone with a concussion\nMany of you know a high school football player or you know a college hockey player and you may know someone who's had some head injuries and they're just not the same since then now this topic is very interesting to me because when I was doing my training and neurology\nAt that time concussions were kind of blown off there was kind of a a chuckle so to speak about post concussion syndrome how could somebody get a head injury that seemingly so trivial\nYet they develop all these\nLasting symptoms whereas other people have head injuries and they're actually find the head injuries may be even worse and that's particularly important for you as the audience understand\nTheir when we're talking about neurologists here we're talking about neurosurgeons to see people who have horrible brain injuries skull fractures brain bleeds one or multiple different areas of the brain\nAnd the question how could somebody would that type of injury may have a better outcome than somebody who got stunned the mom who you know stands up quickly and hit your head on the cupboard or someone in a a whiplash accident who hits their head on headrest\nSo those are the questions I had been posed for a long period of time by what's interesting is\nFlash accident who hits their head on headrest so those are the questions I had been posed for a long period of time by what's interesting is that the literature is really coming out in favor of all those who are suffering with these chronic post concussion symptoms and so that's what we're going to go into today\nOkay can we go into the history of the mild traumatic brain injury and were handled\nAnd some of the prevailing view is at to recently\nYeah really how they're handled is that you know people would go to the yard and this is still true to a certain extent people go the are they would say you know I hit my head and they say oh you have a concussion or you need to be woken up every couple of hours throughout the night and make sure they're not vomiting if they do start vomiting bring them back to the emergency room\nMaybe they would get a C. T. skin maybe not\nAnd basically just told to go home and rest and rested out when she go away however a lot of people it didn't go away and so that's where the management is now changing in management is now changing such that\nIn a lot of high schools now we have sports medicine program's we're individuals will get baseline testing so an athlete will get baseline testing for their cognitive performance basically how fast can they think\nHow fast can they shift their attention all those ... are now being assessed four and a lot of high school athletes such that if they develop a head injury and then the testing can be repeated and we can see if there's a change in their cognitive performance\nIs that's kind of how it's being handled now many of you watch the NFL and you can see the concussion protocols being Institute's of somebody develops a concussion they have to be taken off to the side they have to be taken through a litany of tests\nTo make sure that they're not demonstrating signs of brain injury and if they're cleared than they can come back on the field but that's a whole other area of debate that will probably go into what\nIs that really a good thing or is it not a good thing so\n[noise] well I think we need to also point out and we've touched on it and yeah the NFL's a big deal the hockey leagues or a big deal there is a lot of injury there's a lot of force and trauma and those things that I've been to a lot of high school football games I've been to a middle school girls basketball games where I've [laughter]\nI've watched these kids I mean they pour their heart into it and I know they do it for a reason they want to start they want it you know want to be at the top five players so they're killing themselves to go after loose balls they do the right girl crashed head\nOn into the bleachers and coach said shake it off through an mom didn't mom took her to the emergency\nRoom and she had a concussion ... as these sorts of things folks nobody loves sports more than I Do I get carried carried away but we also Everytime I see a kid take off like that I think it's got to be some common sense and that is yeah we want to play well that okay there's a set of bleachers\nThere's going to be some information in the brain associate with that head injury if it's severe enough to be a concussion but there's also arguing arguments about repetitive sub concussive head impacts as well but we'll get into that later so in this case you have a concussion\nNow your immune system in your brain is different from the immune system and the rest of your body that's a really really important point folks you got to get that so few Springer ankle think he'll swollen your ankle gets it gets huge it blows up well if you had that same type of swelling in your brain you would die from the most minor head injuries [noise]\nSo that's why in the brain we have a different immune system the immune cells in the brain larger called micro clear there's ... there's all these different types of cells but micro clear are like these little scavengers pacman just kind of hanging out making sure there's no information if there is information\nThen they have to get rid of the information and sometimes they'll even killed brain cells when there's chronic inflammation in the brain\nWill get to that later so now the microbes we are sitting there and they're trying to clean up the information in a very neat and tidy fashion\nBut\nWe get a mild traumatic brain injury or if we have several had impacts that are pretty large\nThen what can happen is that the blood vessels going into the brain can actually stretch and break down so now the blood vessels become like a sieve think of PVC pipes with holes in it and what happens is then immune cells from our body can actually go into the brain\nAnd keep the information going so whereas the brains immune system is meant to be separate it's meant to be prim and proper so to speak now we get the rest of the gang so to speak coming in from your body and keeping the information going in the brain\nOnce this happened this keeps an inflammatory syndrome perpetuating and this can lead to nerve cells dying like in the memory area this can keep someone continually having symptoms of headaches or the ...\nOr fifty other symptoms after a head injury now also after the head injury the brain goes into a state of stress signaling stress I stress responses throughout the body so stress hormones can go up\nLike two to three hundred percent after a head injury\nAnd when the stress hormones elevated at this level researchers are now seeing that the gastrointestinal tract can break down and we can develop this thing called ... syndrome which we talk about every week and I hate the term but it's a true entity and so the intestines can break down\nAnd then food molecules from what we're eating that we've ate our entire lives can actually start getting through the intestines and irritating the immune system creating more information then goes back into the to the brain\nAnd this is his wife's in another broadcast it's almost as though I've seen patients who have post concussion syndrome eat something and develop a concussion afterwards and it's like how is that possible they didn't hit their head well what happened was\nThey said something that irritated their immune system and that immune information goes into their brain and creates a bunch of information their brain\nAnd so it's like a concussion but they didn't actually have a concussion but it's like that well this is so so so important we're actually finding relative to these individuals who are worried about chronic traumatic encephalopathy and we'll talk about some research on diet being done right now\nOn that topic by it's important for use the list or the mom the Graham father the brother of someone with a concussion who's not recovering to understand what we just said because in essence it becomes a post inflammatory brain syndrome\nThere's some research authors wanting to change the name of postings Russian syndrome to post them toward brain syndrome\nBecause we're seeing the inflammatory brain profiled concussion patients is a very very unique\nAnd it's different from someone who gets in an accident and fractures their leg and fractures iffy ribs but didn't hit their head\nSo we can see a biological signature for post concussion syndrome if you dig deep enough the problem is mostly view\nThe doctors that you're working with God Bless them nothing wrong with them they're doing a phenomenal job but it's hard to be up on the most recent research on this topic I mean articles are pouring out by the day on concussion and to keep up with it is actually a it's not an easy task\nSo that I think Kathy that kind of pizza picture the one thing I left out would be the hormonal component and I know you and I talked about this this morning and the hormonal component is very very important too because if you have post concussion syndrome and all of a sudden\nYou're depressed and you don't have the energy used to have you don't have the muster used to have well it's really important that your hormones be tested\nBecause the pituitary gland is our master or mono control blind it looks like a grape and this grapes sets in like a cop but the cup has like edges at the top that come closer together so that means is that the stock of the great\nCan shake back and forth after a head injury and researchers are finding that sometimes but the ... pituitary gland becomes disturbed\nAnd it will stop sending the right hormonal signals to the ovaries or to the testicles or to the adrenal glands or to the thyroid gland and as a result of that than hormones can become drainage and you get secondary hormonal effect after the head injury\nSo all these factors need to be taken into account if you've had a concussion if you've had a concussion you've done your doctor they just tell you that your normal and you're not feeling normal for weeks months years afterwards you need to dig deeper you need to know that this information is out there just got to find somebody who does this and that's what we do it gets what else go ahead\nOkay well number one next August sounds like it's cyclical tomato unfair start from the information it just it goes on this cycle [noise] what what if any\nOkay well number one it's all just sounds like it's cyclical tomato once you start from the information it just it goes on this cycle [noise] what what if anything break the cycle\nWhat I've found break the cycle is lots of times though involves changing someone's foods that they're eating and for a lot of you out there you're going to be thinking like what\nHow is that how does that work well let me tell you if you're eating foods that are inflammatory and growing them ... back to you and your test and lots of times that's the first place to start is finding the right foods for that individual I Can't give all view the post concussion syndrome by in my opinion it doesn't exist\nBut there is an individual specific approach for this also as I mentioned from the neurology of I'm a ... exam each type I'm I'm at has hundreds if not thousands of references behind it we can figure out with a high degree of certainty what areas of the brain are kind of off line so to speak\nAnd then we go in and we actually start giving specific\nRehab exercises largely eye movements could be sensory motor rehab exercises could be electrical stimulation on one part of your body to fry an increased activity of that era the brain so it functions better but then within the world being a carburetor girl just referred to as functional neurology\nWe retests the person because sometimes when somebody has a brain injury and you're going to stimulate the area that was damaged\nThey'll actually they may get worse after that stimulation because it's too much I think of somebody who is two and a hamstring you don't have him go out and sprint again\nYou have to rehab that muscle nice and slow over a period of weeks getting rid of the information so that it can come back and be strong it's the same exact principle for re having a brain injury\nAnd it's just a little more nuance because the brain is very sensitive it's very complicated\nSo on and so forth so that's where I started Kathy when okay let's go into the confusion about imaging and concussion then\nOkay and so on the topic of imaging this is probably one of the areas where I'm most excited right now why because I I really like to bring validity to issues if there is limited he to be had\nAnd so so many have you with concussions post concussion syndrome are told your normal you're imaging test our normal there's nothing wrong with you lots of times you're borderline accused of faking it\nAppears may not understand you other parents may not understand why your child's still has concussions symptoms and they made you think that you're weak and yeah and that's the reason why you're not getting better well\n[noise] it's been since really the NFL has paid closer attention to the concussion issues and this thing called chronic traumatic encephalopathy researchers had been digging into ways to figure out what actually happened after a head injury and they knew that the standard MRI's scans\nWeren't showing anything wrong well that's kind of like\nSaying somebody has strep throat or they have a throat infection but you know we don't really know what's causing it well we know we use a microscope or if we played out you know the bacteria in the throat we can actually figure it out so sometimes we have to look at the microscopic level and that's what new imaging ... are being done\nFor traumatic brain injury patients so these new imaging modality for those of you listening out there if you want to bring up your browser your laptop your phone if you're not driving\nAnd you can look up diffusion tensor imaging and this type of imaging referred to as ... and if you bring up the images on it is really really cool because it will show\nThe damage to the white matter tracks and the brain what are the white matter attracts the white matter tracks for all intents and purposes or like the wires and your brain so you have the little ...\nAnd our trucks and the brain what are the white matter attracts the white matter attracts for all intents and purposes or like the wires and your brain\nSo you have the little cell body of dinner on the brain so that's like the master control center lots of times these cell bodies may be at the top of the brain what many of you will knows gray matter well then these cells send down their wires to the brain and researchers are finding that it's the wires lots of times that are stretched\nThat are irritated selectively after a brain injury\nAnd we're getting more and more data that this diffusion tensor imaging seems to be one of its the leading imaging modality researchers are thinking for post concussion syndrome validating the effects of traumatic brain injury\nOn and on and on there are many other types of talked about other broadcast funky drummer I said he's a spec skins\nI last time I looked I Know it's higher than this now is like a hundred and fourteen out of a hundred and Fifteen retired uh professional athletes\nAnd then he did and you sense is going on I last time I looked I Know it's higher than this now is like a hundred and fourteen out of a hundred and Fifteen retired uh professional athletes I Believe football players and I don't know boxers were lumped in there had this thing called chronic traumatic encephalopathy and this is a huge concern now\nFor a lot of mothers this is a big concern for families whether or not they should let their child play something like soccer something like hockey something like football because we're worried about the long term effects that has on someone's brain\nAnd we don't have all the answers but these are becoming you know legitimate questions because there's is there anything more important than your brain you know you can get a hip replacement you can get any replacement you can have heart surgery you can't get a new brain implanted into your head\nSo we really need to [laughter] yeah [laughter] maybe one day probably not too far off [laughter] but you know a brain is\nWe've got to take care of our brains as best as we can folks and if you've ever known someone with a really severe brain injury it can be catastrophic it can also be one of the biggest disabilities to someone's life it can just radically change someone's life in an instance so that's what I'd say real ...\n... so that pretty much takes care of the argument as to why does technology needs to be in ... in clinical practice well\nYeah and I'm Glad you brought that back so the whole thing with this diffusion tensor imaging is that you need to know about it you need to start talking to friends about who have concussions or post concussion syndrome because it is\nIn my opinion at this point I wouldn't have said this probably six months ago just months ago when people are talking about diffusion tensor imaging they're saying you know it works on the population basis but not on the individual basis what does that mean it means that if we took a group of can cost patience\nAnd we compared them to non can cost patience with the diffusion tensor imaging which say there is a difference but researchers at that time didn't say well we don't know what that difference means relative to the individual with that data is getting stronger\nAnd that's what I'm seeing now and we're seeing that this diffusion tensor imaging is correlating with cognitive symptoms correlating with effective symptoms meaning you know people who are depressed\nAnd were seen almost more six months later than we do right after the injury why is that was I talked about this inflammatory cycle keeps going in the brain that's the problem and so it's probably this chronic inflammation in the brain\nThat is continuing to break down some of these white matter tracks more than just the effects of the acute injury certainly the acute injury has to be taken into account\nBut it's a chronic inflammation folks this is why you're not getting better from a concussion post concussion syndrome is an inflammatory problem in your brain you have to get that and the sooner we understand that the more likely post concussion syndrome is going to become a lesser of an issue\nSo that's very important now the other thing I was going to talk about Cathy relatives imaging as this thing called neuro ... the other type of technology is called free surfer\nThese imaging mode ... will it's basically a computer software program that imaging facilities can use\nSo when you get an MRI of your brain they can say how dense different parts of your brain are compared to age matched controls\nAnd what we're seeing is that in these retired professional athletes where there's a high incidence of head injuries were seen differences in densities in different parts of the brain particularly pertaining to\nMemory area\nEmotional area effective areas so we're seeing we're seeing changes in their brain from an imaging standpoint compared to people who haven't played these types of sports that ...\nWe're seeing changes in their brain from an imaging standpoint compared to people who haven't played these types of sports\nThat's so important because a lot of you are now trying to say okay well I don't know is Joey going to develop chronic traumatic so is my uncle who was a professional hockey players you're going to develop chronic traumatic encephalopathy do I can't say definitively now based on this imaging that yes they're going to get it or no they don't have it\nBecause of chronic traumatic encephalopathy is a post mortem diagnosis it's a diagnosis that happens after somebody dies\nThat's the only way we can definitively say if they have it or not but we can say we're seeing changes in density of the brain and these specific areas and these individuals who play these sports are as individuals who have it\nAnd this correlates very very much with their symptoms is very much correlates with the disability that they're talking about\n... send that working I'm more imaging for this so we can see it before they pass away\nYeah exactly and that's where it's going that's the whole thing we we really want to get to a point where we can say defensively okay this person is showing signs of chronic traumatic encephalopathy or hey you're not which is a big deal because a lot of people have trepidation about this a lot of people have worry\nYou know I'm not going to get it I think I have it you know I probably habit well you don't know if you have it or not I just had a case where an individual had repetitive brain injuries and we did this technology on them and they were actually much better than we thought they would be a myself and then which was actually really cool thing\nBecause now we're saying holy moly maybe your future is going to be different because it's not as bad as we thought it was and this person had been told that they were going to develop dementia\nBy several of their doctors\nSo that is a pretty striking example going the other direction so that's one of the criticisms about chronic traumatic encephalopathy is that you know are we play seen fear into so many individuals unnecessarily when this this condition is still in its infancy\nI don't know I think what this this new type of imaging that we're talking about between the ... and the free surfers we're going to really be able to tell patients within the next five years okay\nHey you know it looks like this is this doesn't look good or hey you know you're actually faring pretty well [noise] so anything else Cathy before we go to break a shiny got well technically we're we're over now but we have a little liberty\nAnd now again just getting the number to call in if they've got a question we really did want to hear from them\nYeah exactly seven oh

structure of my life I definitely have to a carve out a little more time before it was almost like either a friends or are people that I met along the way which say hey can you help me with something and so it was very sporadic but I was happy to do it any time somebody asked\nAnd now that we've made it official and we have our past are members out there that no that that's my job to help them I get a lot more phone calls and I'm a little bit a busy or doing that but it's been a lot of fun\nHave you gotten any um views of satisfaction from it yeah\nSo you know probably the biggest uh one that

today is uh Mr Scott Ben Austin is the latest news the most current multifamily mentor other Houston market area scot doing with the lifestyles for a long time on stuff that apartment complexes going after a few more right now\nAnd has been helping people diligently even before he was on the mentor a team so Scott\nI'm going to ask you probably the hardest question to ask any mentor and I don't know sixty days enough for you to come up with a robot answers but maybe just you're eight years of helping people's friends\nThroughout lifestyles may give you a good sense of where I'm going with this and that is what every new mentors I said you know how do you grade yourself as a mentor\nAnd it's really difficult because you know he said well I Would agree to myself that no one ever has with the whole deal and you can hear on that side by saying OK I'm just going to say no to everything easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything or you'll never be wrong\nNo one will ever come back at you and say you were you man you were wrong in this level off the bus or the other side we have the other kind of mentors got a we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come to the right word for it so it's not insulting there they really\nReally really really really want to help you get what you want to the point where maybe they're not using enough of their own personal I'm\nConservative is to stop them from making yeah restraint and and being able to you know you look I Know you really want this I notice when really you know you really like this but there's quite a few things that you know the red flags\nIt is but there's quite a few things that ... you know the red flags go up to here in the back of my next going up this just doesn't seem like the right deal for you um\nYou know there's that balance in the middle where Ninety nine percent of the ... through deals end up doing good ones the other one percent of people that don't listen to how to do what you don't want to do it\nUh that's the perfect and then the final indicator is okay or how many people by retired and made millionaires out of that's good that's a good score card and how many people that I've consulted have become national park association winters\nSo I haven't had this conversation with you yeah because you've been so busy since you got here and I've been to be the last couple of weeks also have you thought about any of those parameters constraints as to how you would grade yourself personally as a consultant\nWow I really haven't thought of that you know you hit on a lot of things there that I have seen it sixty days and I thought about sixty days but I hadn't thought about the overall kinda what do you want your legacy to be a deal and in this uh in what I'm doing now um I can tell you that\nWhen I Am working with people and I've done this and this is part of the lifestyles culture that we try to\nKind of pushed through and when and\nIf if you talk about people who are doing exactly what we're doing syndicating deals buying deals whatever outside of lifestyles so many times I was in this conversation yesterday\nThose guys make all their money up front on fees and things for putting that deal together and they really don't have a vested interest in what the long term success as a any particular deal\nBecause we invest in every deal that we do in addition to taking other people's money\nI really look at this and it Curtis does a great job in the multi family orientation session of talking about the family office and that's kind of a new thought that he put in my head\nAnd really figuring out how to maximize my net worth and in effect grow it and so I look at every deal that way whether I mean there are not in it now that I'm a mentor and so the two smaller deals a mentor people on there were no brainer sin and when I mentioned before sometimes you've got to give them a little shove off the cliff\nThat's what these war they were first deals for these folks but when I looked at him it was like guys if\nYou don't make a decision to do this I got twenty other people a year that I Know we'll do this today and uh and then they can ventilate jumped and they're going to be great um the hundred and sixty four young mother will\nAlways got Scott I'm actually share with you just so you have the ... that are using the today I called the cattle prod mood you know he got what do you do with someone who won't take actually hit him with the cattle proud what does that\nI used to say it all the time is if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm going to give it to somebody else but we're not going to let this would get away so I've always called the cattle brought ... okay thirty a hundred or\nA hundred and sixty four year deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper analysis it wasn't so obvious a good deal um and we ... we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips unfortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very smart very good at\nThe numbers and a way and we got through that but it took a little bit of work then that brings us to the the one that I'm working on this afternoon which is the out of town deal um this one doesn't help that it's not in the Houston market where I've been act or\nYou know active for ten years now and I pretty well known sub markets and things like that this one I had to do a little homework on\nAnd when he first brought back as an initial analysis I found some things that I thought he was trying to favor the deal a little too much and I did have to pull him back and say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage some of that we've gotten a more ...\nAnd say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage some of that we've gotten a more farm loan quote which can substantially affect the deal and so we're going to take another run at it this afternoon so\nI have seen a little bit of the spectrum I guess in how deals develop I haven't had a deal yet uh we had one on a a acquisition road trip that a few people were pretty heavy on and I did I we didn't get very deep into it but I\nCame out on the road trip and I said this deal too rich there's not enough\nUpside to this deal to make it worth their while and we were told a couple of people off of that deal um but fortunately we didn't get all the way down to ... diligence and get everybody's hopes up to invested in the deal but that's that's the biggest problem sometimes you get people that are doing first deals and they're emotionally\nInvested in them and it's hard for them to let go and and that's where I Do see my\nKind of position here is to make sure that people don't get a little too anxious are losing patience and make sure the good deal comes along because it took me nine months before I got my first deal under contract and I was completely walking the gray line between unemployed and self employed for those nine months so uh\nI was definitely anxious at Emory ah Jacob had to hold me back from doing a bad deal at that time so I've never forgotten that\nYou know I remember during the rise and so forth you were you have an interesting personality your personality fears nothing\nBut yet you're very analytical and I've had conversations with you and you know after our conversations where it's been like man the worlds coming to an end in which better be careful that I've had other conversation with you you know what I'm going to go do something way out here over left field we'd never done before because I just think it's interesting that my my really pay off\nSo you you got a lot of ah versatility in your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question though and that is this\nUm about a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember a time flies you know the last couple of months ago on very quickly\nBut we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you're kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know I'm really kind of the point where I might not do any more deals and uh I might just start by partners out and and you know changing my position more like yours do ... more of it\nAnd then I'm looking at your your your work upper today man you got like one new deal you just closer to more deals you're going after\nWhat did you do you do consulting changes that we've got to go to a break so I don't want you to talk to the break but I'm just wondering did you take some new go Jews are you taking your new vitamins or was helping other people got you back out there going man the market really is good right now let's get going so what's the hold on one back if you guys want to ask got specific question\nIt's got to be reinvigorated re involved and uh and deals are coming to me so it's not like I'm really out there looking for them it's just that being more active again things kind of pop up and I just had my eyes open and\nYou know decide which ones you want to do\nAbsolutely now I'm going to throw in other curveball act you along those same lines and I'm going to put words in your mouth which are knows when sanitary but look at it from this point of view about the time that all this came about you found this deal out of eased back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country\nAnd then the concept came to us for the first time ever that you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in Texas I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units I'm not going to guess but it's a lot of properties a lot of units\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would it be like to take the money and the sophistication and the experience that we've accumulated in this group and taken some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or\nWithout being insulted at least they have less experience than we do\nAnd be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the Texas market area\nAnd ah you nailed one\nWe've had four or five others have gotten nailed in the last couple of months and all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people coming to road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston\nAnd Dallas and San Antonio is going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to things and going to ah you know all these different places we have these deals and they're now saying we've opened\nTo Atlanta Georgia and going to things and going to um you know all these different places we had these deals and they're now saying we've opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I you know you see that I think you're feeling that I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\nIt absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right and my wife and I are first two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was where best opportunity was so we moved there for a little while before we moved back to Houston and\nBeginning of last year I had went on a big junk mail a\nCampaign and so I started an subscribing to all these things to creep into your mailbox overtime for signing up for various things and sitting on the couch with a a football game or something on she was on the other end of the couch down whatever she was doing on her laptop\nAnd I was an subscribing and deleting all this junk mail\nAnd one of the things that happened a RA which is one of the big brokers here in town and they are national uh had gotten bought by Cantor Fitzgerald\nAnd when that happened I had been on their website and I had set preferences so I only got deals into Houston metropolitan area at the time that I started doing this I said why would anybody have to leave a city like Houston there's so much opportunity here to do any of this and I had I stated rule that if I couldn't drive to it and be home\nBy the end of the day I didn't need to own so ah anyway as um sorting in and I didn't batch delete I was just hitting delete delete delete scrolling through the subject lines the Cincinnati deal pops up and I went huh and I clicked on it and I very quickly from looking at so many deal sized up that if this was in Houston, Texas\nIt was a no brainer and they would sell for a lot more than the price was on this a posting that I saw and\nSo yeah I asked my wife what do you think about buying this deal out of town and we've got a\nBusiness excuse to go fly up there a couple of times a year and see all those friends that we left behind Twenty years ago when we came back to Houston\nAnd she sent out whatever you want to do if you want to manage and I said but it means that I've never had to do this but I'm probably going to be gone at least one night a month going up there just to make sure everything's still running right and she said oh that's fine you know our our two girls were out of the house by this time and we just have one kid left there so things are manageable if you think tried to do it so we ended up doing it\nUm I went to my three uh kinda largest investors that have long term vision and I said guys this little bit of a flyer but will your back you know the steel and they were all in\nAnd we did the deal it's been phenomenal the ah we bonded since August of last year\nWe're on pace to return Nineteen percent cash in on cash and our first year of ownership Brennan interest only periods of things are\nObviously cash along really well but it's a fifty five and over high you'll play a property not not a a value play that we're having to fix up\nAnd we kept saying management group in fact it was a it was run and we're really well so I saw no reason to shake things up up there we put it a little bit of cap acts and we're making it even more efficient so that when the principal kicks in our cash on cash probably won't have to tip\nWill just a cover it with our increased rats that we're getting out of this place so that that's a great place I was actually up there about\nThree weeks ago I guess and they really wanted one of my masters who was from Battle Creek Michigan founded a lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to invest they wanted him at the Detroit road show that you guys had about three weeks ago and he couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and\nHelp out and really kind of tell his story and how we met down here and now we're investing in other

[laughter] spend it all out of two billion dollar stadium that he gets ... I'll figure it out from there\nSo Tuesday nights of drawing so if you haven't got your tickets go down and get it you never know and the closest place to stay like correct yes I think a wild those lines are going to be law while they were not not now but probably Monday and Tuesday night like over the weekend is probably not that\nBad she went on Thursday should only about ten minute wait oh\nYou bought something yeah but the drawing already happened yeah but we have it for next drawing to so\nIf I Will not at fifty bucks hundred bucks I\nDon't know I was honored dollars\nThey got as if it's going out to the two billion that quick people are dropping a lot of money right now well they were selling two hundred tickets a sec yeah you know it does the ... let's let's fill like thousand each of them just deal with [laughter] I I mean that's got to increase their odds slug you well they did I'd rather you\nBuy one ticket or a hundred tickets [laughter] and it are limited on five hundred million to one but yeah\nIt ... to ... to me it doesn't uh [laughter] and we're going to win you might want to spend that I Know what I Would lose just because by the time we started looking at the hundreds one I'd be like this crap and then it's been there about the the quick fix\nNext article you guys below says that most Americans would rather renovate and move I mean that's kind of what we've been talking about right why we didn't have a lot of supply bart in this town ... theory was\nWell you've been here a long time so you know twenty five years ago the different and you you still sold new homes you know the the spread between a new home in the resale let's say twenty five Twenty years ago yeah it was about twenty thirty grand right like it was less than ... it was the oh yeah it was it was like\nBut the the spread between a new home in a resale let's say twenty five Twenty years ago yeah that was about twenty thirty grand right like it was less than ... it was the oh yeah it was it was like a five to ten grand right so so your choices were well I'll just renovate my house or I'll just go buy new out right right ...\nAnd and and actually you know are we only last deals typically if somebody wanted to turn key yard and yeah they just want to turn key out otherwise we want you know\nYeah so now that's not the case in fact\nWell we're not going to tell you what the resale prices till next segment right by new home sales wave western three eighty five way right yeah and plus the four hundred thousand um and\nYou know people want to move to one of two places typically Vegas right green dollars so they can afford it well that's the point I mean that that's becoming an issue for people so\nYou know I I put I've I've given my own scenario as an example um for people and why I think the the the listings are so down or excuse me the supply\nIs you know I'm In green valley have a decent house and\nYou know my next move up would be like McDonald's highlands you know I mean I could afford that house\nBut I don't need a two or three million dollar house right right so we've we've sunk a lot of money in our house renovating it ... and you know like if you're if you're in summer well now you guys right in in you're in a five hundred thousand six hundred thousand dollar house which is just an okay house\nProbably right I mean it's probably twenty five hundred square feet ... neither house a nice neighborhood who go buy a brand new house in summer when I was nine hundred thousand he he's\nEasily I mean ... if you want a decent house you're seven figures right so\nYou know that's it so this is a pretty staggering number it says that Seventy six percent of the country would rather upgrade than relocate I mean that seems high tomatoes and you guys and we got a call and really get John alone I'll thank God because I just kept John talking with John are you there I'm the one hung over here\nJohn yeah I Am here\nWelcome to

recall it will talk to you to stay there and when you have good to hear from you know that was good called love that guy you out of our listeners listens every single week we helped with his house and I don't believe that they got me six percent number going back to that article\nAlso marital how I Would rather stay in their current home and make renovations and move according to a study a Seventy six percent of Americans would rather use a set amount of money to upgrade their homes as opposed to using that same set of funds as a down payment on the house now that's not good for our businesses no but you know what I mean\nHere's the thing though why if\nYou look for a house as a buyer you're you're first thing you your narrative\nHouse now that's not good for our businesses no but you know

know what I mean and and some of these um we I think when you buy gas strike it's is that we're more most of the luxury market's going is the modern war\nYeah mean William with somebody and rules are all modern everything\nYeah modern yeah and that's kind of where I I Would if I had this type of money that's what I Would buy but something you know the obviously very nice houses one\nUp and then you know an enclave court we're looking at him and a half million team and a half million dollars out what's so that was David Copperfield cells remember that so um you know all the way to fourteen Thirteen all the way down to ten\n... you know a couple in McDonalds highlands after mentioned McDonald's islands\nMan and Dr that's a section ten if I'm not mistaken\nNow yeah yeah what's that what's your biggest lifting Aaron you've ever done a four point eight million wasn't really yeah Mm nice\nWeather about this year was the biggest one couple of million a one point seven which this year yeah middle one point eight million dollar loan yup and uh you know I always do a ... million dollar lifting of the year but fell apart on us\nWe were talking about the ... at yesterday at Marshall's Silver's house a couple of the agents that are in our inner circle over they're talking about they want to get into the high end market\n... and a ... so you so when people don't understand what you're talking about your marshal Silver's you're motivated motivational speaker\nMarshals had over a lot of people know him he's a world renowned hypnotists motivational speaker public speaker a sales trainer right so I hired him as my personal coach we did these three day event ... and uh so when I signed up for was actually three days at his house\nSo it's really cool it's first classic take you there in ... uh the dinners and lunches are spectacular the training is as is unbelievable and there's eleven of us and it's called prosperity powers austerity has set of houses Seventeen thousand square feet\nOn an acre and a half and its dial death I mean you walk in you feel like you're at a hotel\nAnd it's just amazing and eleven of us that are there it's just really getting to know where we want to be financially some people are more personal where they want to go personally but a couple of the agents there's about six realtors there\nFor from Vegas a couple from other cities ... one of them it wants to get into a high end real estate\nAnd she gets nervous and the timid ate it every time she talks to somebody that wants to lift her house at two three or four million so we were kind of overcome\nAnd she gets nervous and said timid aided Everytime she talks to somebody that wants to lift her house at two three or four million\nSo we were kind of overcoming that objective\nWith that is you know with those people but I think with anybody I don't care about is three hundred thousand smack or in the head why in fact in the head and and and told her that you have to you have to build a release so he she did it listed at five million she got an offer at three\nAnd they would have settled that for but the seller said no that she lost a lifted in six months later it sold for four\nRight so the reason I told her that she doesn't have she didn't get the job done is because she's not building relationships with people you don't care if the house is a fifty thousand dollar mobile home\nOr a five million dollar house if you build a relationship or have them re name like Shapiro insurers sheer will they knew all high end ... what the name but even then he has to have a relationship with that person down to convince him to take the four million\nBecause then you could then you have the right to tell the person to do it hey this is what we're doing I listen to the house the other day for three hundred and forty um did all the paperwork with a wife and the husband called me back those air and I need more money\nI needed to be three sixty and I said no I'm not lifted three sixty now I can just tell somebody that\nBut I've talked in many many times he knows he knows I Know my job he knows that I'm not be asked them and I gave him all the negatives on why you don't want to be high in this market you got to be where you're at you're going to be high in\nThe more you do not not to dust either\nI mean that's why use that CBC or don't 'cause well ... keeps you write about not just relationships either I mean what Marshall silver teachers also as confidence because you to to be able to build a relationship especially with someone some hope for five million\nYou better have a lot of confidence behind you know average I'm wild or did I was intimidated with ... jumbo borrowers may yeah because you know every ... in most cases that listen and I don't know because that's not their job or you have to have\nConfidence that knowledge and skills so you know but but some people have the knowledge and skills possibly they don't have the confidence and yeah it's just like\nWhy do you think and I am going to and I'm going to get more voices with this as we go forward especially be talking to people I'm not going to mention any names anymore but these discount brokers you know one percent or I'll lift your house for two hundred and Ninety nine dollars purple bricks green breaks open door all this crap\nI mean these people can't even negotiate anything why don't why do you think they count it why do you think they ...\nThey want to take out the relationship in a negotiation ... a business which will never happen they have\nNo negotiate the aging skills I'm just give you my opinion and I I I if I get any grief for this I don't care because I'm not mentioned anybody's name but all of you list do the job that you're worth if you're only worth one percent well that's what you're telling everybody and you're worth one percent that's what you're going to get a great male\nAll right let's go to a break you guys because just as the rest
