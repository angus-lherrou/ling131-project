not immune party and everyone is going to be a millionaire they're all lifestyles members everyone's a million I said do you can you see yourself being a millionaire and she goes del\nI Am the second I decided to take action on being one I became one she is I Am a millionaire now I just did our financial now were millionaires so the question is how much more do they want\nEven them I bet they haven't sat down and say because I asked the husband I said look\nWhat is your number one is the number where you'd walk away and say I'm not going to work anymore you already got a million dollars your wife's already got three apartment complexes but you're still working what is your number and the guy couldn't give me an answer not really a straight answer\nOne of those things where you can never really thought about it have you\nHow much money do you want and caviar that with how much do you want to earn per year and do you want to do it by working or bypassed the streams of income\nThe real number you need to understand is what will you be willing to give up your job for because you want to not because you have to because you want to use their income and I asked people this all the time\nGuys you make a hundred thousand dollars a year you'd take home\nSixty thousand dollars a year after taxes income taxes Social Security Medicare state income taxes and your four one K. payment you're taking those sixty thousand bucks a year if I could give you sixty thousand dollars a year where the tax free income\nRight now would that be enough to quit your job in in the Arab League they would say no [laughter] forget it they're living on sixty thousand bucks a year they're earning a hundred thousand bucks a year but they're living on sixty and they wouldn't take sixty did not have to work anymore\nIt just blows my mind\nBut what is your number if you don't have a number then you will never get it fixed it will never work for you right\nLast one is whom do you want to spend this time your life your money your your everything with whom do you want to spend the time with\nYou know that's important question here I Am engaged to sixty one years of age is pretty late in life you know\nBut I found the person I Want to share of the time with I really loved the woman I enjoy every minute with her well that's a stretch to say I enjoy most things with her but that's with anybody's

lifestyles that go through a divorce and within three to six months after the divorce than married again it's mostly met men many man cannot live without being married they need somebody to take care of them\nThey need him off mama take care of me and so I don't think they actually pick just the perfect girl they just pick the next girl\nNext in line step up your turn to take care of me I Can't take care of myself so did you pick the relationship and are you in a relationship that works at a guy the other day this is bizarre told me he said\nI'm probably gonna get a divorce and I had another guy I met\nThe other day and he said you know I'm living separated from my wife but we still see each other very dysfunctional separation because I used to go over there and I see the family and the kids on holidays and stuff um but I don't even have a girlfriend inside anymore I used to have a girlfriend that I have that anymore that was the reason we broke\nUp but you know I said well are you
