motivational beat Robert site out [noise]\nBelieving this rover set off a few minutes of another exciting edition of the gateway show on every Sunday evening from six to seven pm on AM eight forty ... the number one talk station in Las Vegas and uh it's it's a it's a\nIt's a pleasure to be here uh you know it's it's it's one of those opportunities for me to constantly keep growing myself the show's design designed to be a healing opportunity for each of us in other words he's in our minds spirit and bodies that we'd be in a move more in harmony with a successful prosperous life\nOr living courting the highest values that can make our life work here on this earth so that's really what the purpose of this show is in every week in a different way I we we collectively tried to bring this about\nAh so ah tonight to that end I have I've got a couple of different people are three well I've got three people I've got a Angie Covington and Andrew you injure Andy which you\nLoops no she's not she's not on the uh\nI've got a Angie Covington and Andrew you go to Angela Andy which you\nLips no she's not up on the\nAndean hand garter okay and we still looks as you want to say that the third one still going to the uh okay good sorry and there's still a check something so Andrew hang garter um is here but I've known for quite a while as well and then we have our our favorite or\nA river and Bernie Martin's who's here in sharing with us a uh is going to be sharing with us a prayer as well as it towards the end of our show in Boston other thoughts during the show as well\nAnd the whole idea of this show is for us collectively including you to say how can we create a better experience of being alive on this earth\nAnd is it if you think about it isn't that really what our purposes on this earth it isn't that we want to accomplish and most of us have just a couple of different tools that we're working on it the majority of us really get to the heart of it all\nWe think if we just get enough money and everything will be okay and money is good it is a gift I always talk to my kids about this because if you don't have enough money to pay your rent or your bills that can be very stressful a but it doesn't by itself resolve the bigger issues of life it\nDoesn't doesn't buy you love for example you can't have a loving happy relationship uh you know by just having money you might have somebody sticks around for the money doesn't mean they're going to love you and so the deeper issues of what we're seeking this life\nSpiritual growth in awakening and an opening ourselves the highest possibilities of life and so this shows about all those different levels of life\nNow we we need it all it's like you can't live without oxygen you can't live without water you can't say well his water more important than auction you need them both and you need food as well and any of those things would be life would be in complete with and it's the same thing when it comes to these different values that we are talking about that that the fact of the matter is is that\nUh we we need to keep growing all the time in this life at least I certainly do and sometimes we have reversals and nice things happen and uh it and then we find ourselves are disappointed or afraid or upset or\nOr we feel let down or even betrayed and just start talking to a friend recently have felt that she'd been betrayed by somebody that she loved and\nSo when things like that happen it can be a very painful experience and then the question is how do we bounce back from that and that's and that's what the show is really about how do we bounce back from the reversals the upsets and then how do we unleashed the possibilities of our life so now\nI just there's gonna be fun for me I've got a two wonderful friends uh Andrew and Angie Hoover spent a lot of time with Tony Robbins and each in their own unique way and they're going to share some of the insights that they've learned with them and\nI and maybe I'll you know a lot of you know who Tony Robbins is I mean you've heard about him in the news or one way or another over the years we've seen this commercials is is a motivational speaker and an inspirational life coach really is when it comes down to it he's actually worked with many millions of people actually it's it's a\nI mean how many how many people as he's a Andy what ... what do you think how many people's he worked with the huge number I I certainly could not\nTell you the number of bodies all over the world and you certainly influenced quite a few people\nI'm by the way you have a nice voice on the radio in the first time I've heard you on the radio um it's a new new experience [laughter] but uh [laughter] but but yeah and I had an interesting experience with Tony myself going back many many years ago back in Nineteen eighty three I went to his house on New Year's eve and this before\nSeeing experience with Tony myself going back many many years ago back in Nineteen eighty three and went to his house on New Year's eve and this is before he was very well known victims hardly well known at all and uh he did a fire walk and so I I went down there was a ... some friends and we went to his house\nAnd we waited on New Year's eve\nAnd he got us all hyped up into a super excited state or is it really was like that is the first time I realized how people might feel going into battle as first time I had that feeling 'cause you had to overcome your fears so then he got these red hot coals and at that time he claimed\nI don't really know he said it was a world record of how how far we were walking over calls and so we just all walked down over these red hot coals right after New Years\nAnd you know it was scary for me and he ... he goes to work through for a lot of the different beers I remember him saying uh you know there's the face plants here what is your phone hit your face you know all these different fears you could have\nYou know what could happen to you burned off feeds years I mean all these different things with helps me get over my fears there was a lady right in front of me I think it was like eighty with done it

hire more successful way of living and I have\nA many many people tell me all the time that it's changed their lives and so I just go by feedback and so I Know that it does work for people\nHave used it myself by the way I use all the principles and an everyday myself that's how I've been able to overcome some of different challenges of my life and I have them to just like you\nKnow tonight uh we're doing a I'm focusing tonight on some of the different lessons from Tony Robbins one of the a very very well known a speakers of our time or the spy I think on that there's a documentary on right now I'm not your grew\nAgain you can look that up if you want on Netflix and watch it and see what one of his seminars is like and his style and his approach\nBut you know in watching that uh he really help people a lot and I think it's great he's he's helping people unlocked themselves for maybe the structures and that are holding them back to keep them from really you know discovering the real power in life and in their ability to live a joyous happy fulfilled life on this earth\nAnd so uh that that's really a ... and so it's such neither have I. N. G. and also Andrew here to share their experiences because they both worked with them ... extensively\nAndrew met him just a few months after Freud yet ironically I met him in a New Year's eve Nineteen eighty three and a certain like it has an evening at his home and I did end up doing a fire walked back then and then uh in Andrew met him just a couple of months later and uh I ended up\nAnd I did end up doing a fire walked back them and then uh in Andrew met him just a couple of months later and uh uh ended up getting very very involved with bringing a hundred people to them every few months which is an amazing story\nAnd by the way that's a real um that that is a real a\nCompliment to you Andrew that you were able to people really much trust you a lot as you can pull a hundred people in I'm telling you that I didn't know that side of your personality I mean I sort of do actually as a matter of fact but that's that's amazing a testament and complement to\n'em but oh it was ... and why they're here and then now Angie as a whole nother story and a half has she dealt with the Tony I mean she's not she was studying with him indirectly through his tapes and things like that and then one day a suddenly you picked up the phone and he was on the phone talking to you right\nYes yes so it's pretty neat I got to go experience the things I did go to a couple of his seminars over the years um so\nYou know I went to and I think in Nineteen Ninety seven and I went to one in two thousand six and then in two thousand fourteen he became my client so I was like wow this is really great and not only do I get to go into the experience him on a personal level like he's actually paying me\nWhich was really so you will cause I promise you the seminars or not a hundred and twenty five dollars now but they're still worth way more than a hundred and twenty five years or whatever people are paying\nSo ... yeah so one day you unexpectedly he picked up the phone and called you right yeah well\nIt was an unexpectedly I knew someone I a client of mine and who was very good friends in well respected by Tony called him and recommended that Tony called me and so I knew he was going to be calling\nYou didn't know that yeah but so is that kind of surprised to hear him talking to you\nKnow in fact it was really you know right before I picked up the phone I was like you might nervous when I was like no I'm not nervous this is great and had a really great I I felt like you know it's really kind of weird just because of the nature of his work you feel like\nLike he affects your life in a personal way and so therefore you feel like you know you have a personal relationship with this person you know what I mean so I was like oh tell me [laughter] I feel like I Know\nYou know and then be in and out of that connection suddenly you got very involved with them for a while and he actually didn't pay for a trip for you to go to India to\nWell that's how I first met him he actually flew me to India to meet him for the very first time yeah how's that for an insured meeting is awesome\n[laughter] that is pretty amazing and it's a matter of fact I remember that whole story unfolding and you have to be very a dynamic yourself because it was almost impossible for you to get a passport that quickly right\nWhen I had my passport it was the visa that was the problem so yeah I have to go to San Francisco for it or something I did\nAnd you know Tony goes you know what I said I said well I think I can fly through San Fran and and he goes don't take no for an answer\nBut then he also had some people who had some juice and we're totally helping me get through but yeah I waited there for um [noise] is that I spent two days they're sitting in the visa office waiting for maybe so but yeah\nWell that's a real story by itself I mean see the thing is that even that story we could spend a lot of talking about because\nAll of us whether it's Ernie a Andrew Andrew myself\nWe come up against block walls or brick walls all the time in our lives where it seems like there's no way through that's my business by the way in my legal business my personal injury business in any part of this is the I just except that is I'm dealing with what seems impossible\nIn my job is to take the impasse\nThe business in any part of it just ... I just accept that is I'm dealing with what seems impossible\nIn my job is to take the impossible and make it possible and so that's just become a a given in my world but you know what a hearing you talk Andrew a sense of ... you're a very good as a communicator if you could get a hundred people sign up for something that's amazing [noise]\nReally the incentive after you've done it one time is the fact that the hundred people you've got to go for she hated it so much that gives you the or\nEncourage them to do the do it again I mean if the people said oh you're wasting my time I Would I Would have a gym sorry but in this case the percentage of people like ah you know it is really worth my while was extremely I\nOwe you needed to talking to make a little bit like that okay there you again okay that's better okay that's good I'm near that's not her now you mentioned I don't know\nBecause one of the experiences I had is that the people who worked for Tony and screw it and so forth with meat became some of my best friends in San Diego and um [noise]\nAnd one of the things when you're talking to people that Tony ... they don't believe that the seminar or he can be worthwhile they think it's a lot of flak for just hyper motivation that kinda stuff and I truly believe he's teaching skills and strategies that you wouldn't have found out elsewhere and one of the things\nThat became very valuable in my life with something called the primary question and what that's about as being resourceful when you need to be and so for me the question is what's the best thing to do next maybe your day you got planned you want to do a B C and D and for whatever reason\nA B and C don't work out or you're in a traffic jam or whatever instead of asking and resourceful questions to ask yourself what's the best thing to do next\nAnd to do it in a very intense way of like what's the truly what's the best thing to do next and I'm gonna give you a very real life example of how this really helped out I'm One of my best friends who also worked for Tony a wasn't a car crash and this guy his name as a\nRobert also and um he um he got me to do more charity in my life and just a great great guy and a ... and I'm I'm at the hospital with his fiance his son his family and I've worked in emergency rooms and he looked OK to me he was unconscious but I'm he was all hooked up by and um\nAnd they're saying they'll talk to me whatever and\nAnd he he couldn't do that which was no it's fine but I we wanted say encouraging things but now the doctor comes in\nAnd it's been ten to fourteen hours since the accident and he says bill is dead and it was just overwhelming and the doom and they just a horrible how just horrible everybody felt\nAnd the natural questions to think of how unfair this is how much you're gonna miss bill off\nAll these other questions but there was not a resourceful person in that room and I was just looking around going this this is horrible how can we make something good out of this and I was the best thing to do next this is where my primary question and I just said look I mean the sad this decrying the whatever it was going on in the room and I had to raise above that\nUh-huh uh-huh\nAnd you know um\nAnd even that as many layers to it right but that's beyond the spoke of the show but the the bottom line is that\nSo that that's helpful to me so what ... what what Tony I'm thinking to myself what Tony one of his genius is identifying these structures of thinking that help you unlock the direction of your life so number one but there was the second thing you said your why and what is your why you were saying that's your motivator right\nYeah the why as the motivator but I don't know that that's necessarily a Tony teaching I mean that John ... from my knowledge of human behavior and I was going to write a book on why that's [laughter]\nOh okay there you go I've um [noise] interesting so so okay so your primary questions so what are other was a few other key things that you feel like the Tony has brought you there is also made him so effective for some new people\nI have to tell you like after that last state with gas in either one in two thousand fourteen 'cause like I said I had gone to one in two thousand six\nSo eight years later it was really great to see my progress and to see\nBecause my old primary question would have never been anything they can do a fair for love and joy in my life right I was like how can I get more do more be more or whatever you know who knows what it was back then but anyway so after that I was working with them at their house and\nYou know he said to me he said so did you get I mean it's been a while you know what what did you get out of this one was there anything that was a big takeaway for me\nIt was huge and it was when he talked about\nMeaning making and basically what we are as we are meaning making machines\nWhatever is happening to us in our lives from you know somebody cutting us off in traffic or in the sun\nWhatever is happening to us in our lives from you know somebody cutting us off in traffic or you know the someone calling us back or not calling us back whatever it is it's happening we created meaning to it we decide what it means\nWhile we make up a reason why they're not calling us back in ... I mean\nWe don't really even know if it's ever accurate right but we're just making up meanings all over the place this means that oh this person did this oh and then we go off in a whole fantasy don't well whatever it is I mean this is how the mind works right and so what I said to him as I'm like\nI got home meaning making thing because what I took away from it was that really\nAgain we will never know the truth I Will never know what anyone else's thinking or what happened or why someone cut me off or whatever I'm never going to know that and\nIf I'm going to be making up a story that may or may not be true then why wouldn't I make up stories that make me feel that er meanings you know what I mean I call them stories right by the story I tell myself and what it means is really about it and and he's got lots of quotes about that and then things that I've seen through\nYou know it's not what's happened to you it's what you tell yourself about what's happened to you\nIs that's you know one of his teachings that I had heard years ago but that's\nMeaning making and so that was the thing that I took away from the two thousand fourteen and so now I'm constantly paying attention to what do I think that means why do I think that and does that made me feel good and and what it does it have on your life well yeah and it could be this you know\nIt could be you know what I might have missed is because it's supposed I didn't get that lottery ticket\nYou know I didn't make it out there to state line and I didn't get it and look nobody was so it was meant to be you know what I mean it's so it's ... you know what I'm Talking about how likely tell yourself whatever the meaning is because the ... is coming to me next [laughter]\nShe's a ... or so so so Andrew what about you I mean because of their primary question a she's a me making what whether take away do you have\nThe power of her poor ... if you want to influence other people and in life if you want to uplift people or what have you having report with them your opportunity to influence and would be much greater and I have a friend who absolutely nose was to be true and yet if he's not respected by the person\nThat that he will not even try to establish report I think it's been like one of the great things that has kept him from being more successful is a very bright person very skilled but if he doesn't feel respected he doesn't take that extra step to um he just blows the person off or just in life\nNo matter what you're trying to do like your attorney so in front of a judge or whatever\nOn certain you feel much better if your report with the uh the attorney and the other people even your defending attorney if you can find different basis is where you agree on certain things during the political arena ... oh my goodness you know\nWhether you like Trump or just like Trump I mean if you can find some things that you agree in the in the middle there it's very important to have some report before he can cause any understanding whatsoever\nInteresting so reporter so so or ... well I think we can all agree the ability to succeed uh I'm Talking to clients and also insurance companies and attorneys everyday my ability to generate some real poor is going to be determined liabilities exceed isn't absolutely\nAnd that's where when and also just another sort of in life I mean four of us here we get along at ... I don't have to go to great lengths now to try to have reported we'll get to like each other and what happens\nWhen there's there are certain times and light so at first you just notice that we're not we're not going to cut off here and so you know\nI mean is there are certain times in life so at first you just notice that we're not we're not cut off here and so knowing that you want to establish reports uh\nYou you do a pattern interrupt you do something that is going to shift things make them think differently so that can you can possibly get in to report down the road it's just knowing that reporters important is a very important to steal the have because of some people would not know to go\nAnd you know you're we're gonna have to go to Rick seventies or something very important I like because I think we all do sometimes sometimes easier to walk away or they don't get me I'm walking away you're saying if you can keep pushing through that and generate some real report that's correct\nThat's hey that was a worth the price of admission tonight actually all of it has been I'm just ... but I mean but but the bottom line is that's an invaluable concept isn't it you know don't turn away how many times that I can look at my so many times I backed off of things because I thought I was going to be rejected or something when I really wouldn't have\nBeen that's that's the story part right Angie I found out later on was rejected it all but I cut myself off that's right because of the meaning that you created around that\nSo what are you the people that are listening what are
