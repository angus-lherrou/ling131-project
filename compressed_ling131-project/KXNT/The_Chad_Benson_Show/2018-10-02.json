uh although I Do believe to quote from Iceland which is how you see the problem is the problem\nAnd um when you\nTie that to this other state which is you can't solve the problem with the same level of thinking the problem was created at a you come to the point where you realize that whatever it is in life you're going to try to accomplish\nIs going to be limited if you start with the first base assumption being wrong\nSo that's your question have you ever been speaking have you ever been in a place where you're speaking to someone and they're talking about something and you're going they have no idea what they're talking about their bases slumps and in this whole thing is completely wrong\nNow you can look at politics for example and you have the trickle down economics theory and then you have the mass wealth redistribution theory and both of those basic the Democrat Republicans theories\nOr a completely different point of view how the world really works and to this date they both keep trying to prove that their theory of economics is correct\nBut the reality is they're both off in some manner because if you let either one of the to stay in power long enough\nOur off how much the off by well there's an old saying do you think about this I'm a different way to look at it as if you were to go and\nTry to walk a straight line it's almost impossible to walk a straight line and you realize you veer off by a fraction of an inch and every step and eventually that fraction which allows you to end up miles away from where you thought you'd go\nThey've done experiments with this people just don't have it in their brain good walk straight the only way you can walk straight used to focus on something that's way out in front of you and walked towards it\nThat's the only way you can walk straight you have to be focused on something that's real and that's the problem\nYour idea about finances the way you see the world\nIs it real it's based on a mistake in theology that has been handed down from century ... century in this country\nProbably in other countries I don't know because I'm not lived there ... the algae of their belief system but an honors I Know since I was a kid everything I've ever heard from my grandparents or great grandparents was the only way to get ahead financially is to get a great job\nThat is it\nHow do you make money you get a good job\nWork leads to money\nNow there's all kinds of derivatives off of that wrong assumption one of them is I Need to work a lot so you lose your life your life is miserable because I was working sixty eighty hours a week when I worked in corporate America\nMy wife was miserable and did I make a lot of money I mean almost no money I think I'd be Seventy thousand bucks a year which is I look at it now that's nothing\nThat's almost nothing\nRight [noise]\n[noise] just insane you know by the time you take it home ... thirty five hundred dollars a month\nYet I thought I was semi successful because I had a good job I thought was a good job but it was it a good job and the reason that I wasn't getting anywhere with because of the base assumptions a second base assumption everybody has you need to save a little money\nOkay that's a great idea there's nothing wrong with that idea at all that he's probably a starting place for finances to be good but what is a little amount of money\nYou have a wrong assumption about what you think you can save one or two or five percent of your income and save up enough money to get richer insane\nWhen I was young my assumption was I Will live on half of what I earn and every year I'll Try to earn more so I get to a little bit higher\nA level so when I made you know thirty thousand dollars a year I Lived on Fifteen when I made forty I Lived on twenty when I got to Seventy I Lived on thirty five\nWhen I got to a hundred thousand a year I Lived on fifty when I got the two hundred thousand lived on a hundred and when I got to five hundred thousand a year I Lived on a hundred when I got to a million a year I Lived on a hundred two hundred and fifty\nBecause at that point I didn't need to live on even half of it for me to have a decent life\n\nBy making that different assumption to not say five or ten percent but to save half at least half\nHas made me rich another assumption how large about how should you I've never owned a home that was worth more than one year's pay\n... repeat that I've never owned a home the total more than one year's pay\nI've never owned a home that I had to pay thirty your mortgage on [noise] I bought houses I could afford to own\nI've never owned a home that I had to pay thirty your mortgage on [noise] I bought houses I could afford to own and live in I\nHave a beautiful sixteen thousand square foot home right now paid cash for twenty car garage beautiful place cost me next to nothing compared to the income I made the year I bought it\nSo you you think about this what the ... are you living\nHas gone the rate of the other day talking to Dave Ramsey guy the guy had a forty thousand dollar pickup truck\nAnd he had a forty thousand dollar your job you don't have a home equal to what your you know so he's got a car equal to what happened is their annual salary was these are bad assumptions guys\nReally bad at some sports another bad assumption another bad assumption is a college will always get you higher paying job\nThat's a bad assumption in when I was growing up they hatch statistical data\nThat showed if you uh graduated from high school\nYou earn thirty thousand a year if you got one year of college in either thirty five if you had two years yet associate degree you're forty or fifty if you had a four year college degree you're sixty or Seventy pie at a doctor's degree or a master's degree you could hurt a hundred thousand if you had a doctor's degree get her in a hundred and fifty thousand\nAnd they have the statistical data right\nBut how has that data been used to create a situation where eighty percent of our kids coming out of high school now are going into college for stupid degrees spending tens of thousands if not hundreds of thousands of dollars going into debt\nTo get a degree in something they can't even get a job in\nThat's a bad assumption and the thing is interesting guys\nIs it like on the trains that what I found out this is why I'm doing the show today about this like I found out in the trends that deal when you make a bad assumption you finally get to the end of the road\nAnd you say whoa you're staring at the edge of political I can go no further with this idea it will not take me any further next step is off the cliff now you gotta turn around and go back going back sometimes more painful than struggling to get where you're at\nI have to let all this stuff go on do all this stuff I did and then figure out the right stuff to do see that's the real challenge folks\nIn my summer I talk about the tale of two was the two types of people that I run into and being a teacher and a mentor or I had to figure out how to deal with each of these two different kinds of people because they both failed on their personalities\nAnd it was just based personality failure it had nothing to do with the material I was given the same material to both\nPeople and both people were failing but there were failing in a different manner\nSo I like to talk about the difference between the type a personality type B personality type a personalities someone with instantaneous gratification disease they want everything they want and they want it all and they want it right now\nAnd they had these needs\nTo get what they want it that they're driven when they want something they are insane or in my fiance is one of these type days and stuff she does base theory is if she wants something shooting on her phone get on the Internet and she will shop for twenty four hours straight till she gets what she wants\nI mean it's just to watch or it's ferocious now on that same side of her that ferocious when she goes into tax problem\nLike when I sat around to a health club or a house or out to apartment complex was an operating effectively she used that same ferocious ... to attack that problem she's a problem attacker challenge\nShe gets bored so whatever it was she bought that she loves she bored with it no time at all and want something else she needs constant new stimulation to keep going\nTo\nGo further on type a personalities type for science a basic belief systems\nOne of them is if you stick throw enough mud on the wall something's got to stick so they take the shotgun approach to doing things whatever it is they do they're doing a lot of things all the same time try to get it all done has what happens with the type a personality their late almost everything they do because they under estimates\nThere are all done has what happens with the type a personality\nTheir weight almost everything they do\nBecause they under estimate the amount of time it takes to accomplish the minute the middle line cast between going from a to B the CD they thinking I can get all that stuff done in no time at all they want to put five things on their car to get done today and the only get one or two of them done\nAnd everything else just gets lost in the shuffle gets put off because they try to put too many things on the car to the same time\nAnother one is they don't think of the long term they don't think\nIn the means of\nHow what will the outcome of this be and should I even waste my time to them they don't care what the outcome is because what they wanted that moment is instantaneously and need that they have to scratch it as\nHaving so when my fiance he goes to the grocery store suspend eight hundred bucks does that tell the story all the time she'll spend eight hundred bucks come home with enough food for a week now in her mind she's got enough food for four weeks right\nAnd she buys all this stuff she'll never cook and she freezes it\nBecause there's no way you do it goes bad so if she does it freezes it goes bad and if she freeze that we never read it because she wants to take the time to take it out and thought because she's never think about what you can eat dinner when she gets up in the morning 'cause that's too far ahead for type rated thing she thinks what she wants instantly so we go out to eat\n[noise] eighty percent of the time\nSo we never use the ... it just feels bad spoils\nAnd then she secretly Throws Away she thinks I don't see are throwing it away because of a sudden it disappears\nAnd the money is wasted I begged her constantly when we go ... put it back you don't need it you're not going to use it and if I go with her to the grocery store we can get down to about four hundred dollars and still have exactly the same amount of food that we eat at home because we only certain meals at home and the rest of the time we go out\nNow if I go by myself I'll get all of which were the food for two hundred dollars\nAnd have the same weeks' worth of food because I don't buy all the stuff she buys it we don't use in ... and it's interesting because it's just the way for brain works she can't help herself\nRight it's just ... ... it's a base assumption about why if I Want something I should get it right now I needed a want it I'm an avid challenge with that is when you're that focused on the current moment in life\nYou have no time to think about where the future is going to be where am I going to be a month or Mao six months from now year from now five years from now ten years from now just no way of seeing that future at All right so they fail\nIn that manner they do it started thousand projects and finished none of them ever that's just the way they are they can't finish things up now\nYou can be a and you can be a be in different topics I'm an a and to be in different topics some stuff on that day I just got to do it and I started out I go get outside and they get into it in the eye burned out\nAnd find out that I did it wrong I moved too quickly I didn't have enough base knowledge and boom there it was just like a talk about this train thing there I Am sitting the edge of this type a personality mistake going man I jumped into this for actually knew what it was supposed to do\nNow I've got to do something else and so I just go do something else well then I come back to the single I'm going to get back and fix this problem that's the be kicking in the be saying you know what\nI got to get back on this and get it done and get it done right that's the be kicking she'll be has another kind of problem it's called analysis paralysis\nA B will never take action there's two reasons B doesn't want to take action\nBe sure you understand what they are\nHe will never take action there's two reasons B doesn't want to take action\nBe sure you understand what they are number one is because if they take action they may make a mistake and bees do not like to be wrong I Will be and I believe I've never been wrong one time I thought I was wrong but I found out I was wrong I was actually write bees will never admit that the wrong there will fight to death\nRight that's just ... started the reason bees will not take action\nIs because it means they have to do so\nThey're going to have to take action beach do not like to do things they rather sit and analyze things watch other people do things to criticize other people but they don't want to go do them\nBees had their way they'd be wearing the same clothes they wore and high school eating the same food they when they were a kid nothing would ever change in their life\nWill change them where to go to the break my back uh ones that
