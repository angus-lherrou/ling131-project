you've been helping people as we know it without being paid mentor for a long time and uh what is it different housing for being on the team now officially compared to just being one of the members who's helping other members all the time\nOr you know it's a providing a little more structure of my life I definitely have to a carve out a little more time before it was almost like either a friends or are people that I've met along the way would say hey can you help me with something and so it was very sporadic but I was happy to do it any time somebody asked\nAnd now that we've made it official and we have our vast members out there that noted that it's my job to help them I get a lot more phone calls and I'm a little bit a busy or doing that but it's been a lot of fun\nHave you gotten any um views of satisfaction from it yeah\nSo you know probably the biggest uh one that that is brewing and it should come to reality I think next week I have a member who I actually met his wife and my first road trip back in two thousand one did I joined I guess it was empty thousand seven\nAnd they became a very large investors with me up to Seventy miles over that time and they are and six out of seven of those deals\nAre Roger has been running a family business which the family has chosen to sell and the buyer realized his position in the knowledge of the business so they have a retained him for twelve months\nGoes into cell and the buyer realized his position and that knowledge of the business so they have a retained him for twelve months\nAnd my goal is to help him and those next twelve months come up with two projects of his own so that we can officially retire him from the working world and he will be living on a\nHis income offer real estate from that point forward the first of those deals we actually started mentor mnemonic before I was employed\nAnd uh now it's it'll be the first hundred and sixty four unit deal that I'll close and it's just he and one other person that are buying that deal and Belmont\nSo I'm looking forward to that one coming to fruition next week\nYou know looking here do your accomplishments of or you got a lot done the first sixty days here it's

I had to find out about find someone who thinks again when you go for a moment to be found to suffer and brought to you by the U.S Forest Service and he had council\nTalking forty F a A N T here's some more conventional wisdom says the man on a mission to retire American one for two months he\nWill go back to do on the radio show with me here today is uh Mr Scott Ben Austin is the latest news the most current multifamily mentor others used market area Scott's been with the lifestyles for a long time on the other part of a complex as going after a few more right now\nAnd has been helping people deliberately even before he was on the mentoring team so Scott I'm going to ask you probably the hardest question to ask any mentor and I don't know sixty days enough for you to come up with a robot answer but maybe just you're eight years of helping people's friends\nThroughout lifestyles may give you a good sense of where I'm going with this and that is what every new mentors I said you know how do you grade yourself as a mentor\nAnd it's really difficult because you know he said well I Would agree to myself that no one ever has with the whole deal and you can hear on that side by saying OK I'm just gonna say no to everything easiest thing for a mentor to do is to say no to everything or you'll never be wrong\nNo one will ever come back at you and say you were you man you were wrong and that's what I Love about uh the other side we have the other kind of mentor Scott a we have a few of these guys that are just um I don't come to the right word for it so it's not insulting\nThere they really really really really really want to help you get what you want to the point where maybe they're not using enough of their own personal um\nReally you know you really like this but there's quite a few things\nThat you know the red flags go up there in the back of my next going up this just doesn't seem like the right deal for you\nUm you know there's that balance in the middle were Ninety nine percent of the ... through deals end up doing good ones the other one percent of people that don't listen to how to do what you don't want to do it\nUh that's the perfect and then the final indicator is okay or how many people by retired and made millionaires out of that's good that's a good score card and how many people that I've consulted ever become national park association winters\nSo I haven't had this conversation with you yeah because you've been so busy since you got here and I've been to be the last couple of weeks also have you thought about any of those parameters constraints as to how you would grade yourself personally as a consultant\nWow I really haven't thought of that you know you hit on a lot of things there that I have seen it sixty days and I thought about sixty days but I hadn't thought about the overall kinda what do you want your legacy to be a deal and in this uh in what I'm doing now um I can tell you that\nWhen I Am working with people and I've done this and this is part of the lifestyles culture that we try to\nKind of pushed through and when and\nIf if you talk about people who are doing exactly what we're doing syndicating deals buying deals whatever outside of lifestyles so many times I was in this conversation yesterday\nThose guys make all their money up front on fees and things for putting the deal together and they really don't have a vested interest in what the long term success is uh any particular deal\nBecause we invest in every deal that we do in addition to taking other people's money I really look at this and and Curtis does a great job in the multi family orientation session of talking about the family office and that's kind of a new thought that he put in my head\nAnd really figuring out how to maximize my net worth and in effect grow it\nAnd so I look at every deal that way whether or not in it now that I'm a mentor and so the two smaller deals that are meant to hurt people on there were no brainer sin and when I mentioned before sometimes you've got to give them a little shove off the cliff\nThat's what these war they were first deals for these folks but when I looked at him it was like guys if you don't make a decision to do this I got twenty other people behind each year that I Know we'll do this today\nAnd uh and then they could actually jumped and they're going to be great um\nThe hundred and sixty four young mother will\nAlways got Scott ... just so you have the ... that are using the today I called the cattle prod mood you know there you go what do you do with someone who won't take actually hit him with the cattle ... what does that and I used to say it all the time is if you don't do this I'm going to do it or I'm going to give it to somebody else but we're not going to let this would get away so I've always called that have cattle prime ...\nOkay thirty a hundred or\nA hundred and sixty four year deal was one that we had to finance a little bit we had to do a little deeper analysis it wasn't so obvious a good deal [noise] um and we ... we had to work at a little bit before we came to grips unfortunately Roger having run his own business and being in six am ideals are so far he's very smart very good\nAt at analyzing the numbers and uh when we got through that but it took a little bit of work then that brings us to the the one that I'm working on this afternoon which is the out of town deal uh this one doesn't help that it's not in the Houston market where I've been act or\nYou know active for ten years now and I pretty well known sub markets and things like that this one I had to do a little homework on and when he first brought back as an initial analysis I found some things that\nI thought he was trying to favor the deal a little too much and I did have to pull him back and say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage\nDeal a little too much and I did have to pull it back and say you know my job is to keep you out of a bad deal and here are the concerns that I have he's gone back and massage some of that we've gotten a more farm loan clerk which can substantially affected deal and so we're going to take another run at it this afternoon so\nI have seen a little bit of the spectrum I guess in how deals develop I haven't had a deal yet uh we had one on a ah acquisition road trip that a few people were\nPretty heavy on and I did I we didn't get very deep into it but I came out on the road trip and I said the steel too rich there's not enough upside to this deal to make it worth their while\nAnd uh we would call it a couple of people off of that deal a but fortunately we didn't get all the way down to do diligence and get everybody's hopes up to invested in the deal but that's that's the biggest problem sometimes you get people that are doing first deals and they're emotionally\nInvested in them and it's hard for them to let go and and that's where I Do see my\nTattered position here is to make sure that people don't get a little too anxious or at least some patients and make sure the good deal comes along because it took me\nNine months before I got my first deal under contract and I was completely walking the gray line between unemployed and self employed for those nine months so uh I was definitely anxious and him right ah Jacob had to hold me back from doing a bad deal at that time so I've never forgotten that\nYou know I remember during the rise and so forth you were you have an interesting personality your personality fears nothing\nBut yet you're very analytical and I've had conversations with you and you know after our conversations where it's been like man the worlds coming to an end and we better be careful that hurt other conversation with you you know what I'm going to go do something way out here over left field we've never done before because I just think it's interesting in that my my really pay off\nSo you you got a lot of ah versatility and your personality for being able to consult people\nI Want to ask you next question though and that is this\nUm about a year ago maybe six months I Can't remember a time flies you know the last couple of months ago on very quickly but we were sitting over gee Alexander's one day and you were kind of like you're kind of pulling back saying you know I don't know\nI'm really kind of the point where I might not do any more deals and uh I might just start buying partners out in in you know changing my position more like yours do ... more of it\nAnd then I'm looking at your your your work upper today man you got like one new deal you just closed into more deals you going after\nWhat did you do you do consulting change if we had to go to a break so I don't want you to answer was talking to break but I'm just wondering did you take some new go Joe Jews are you taking your new vitamins or was helping other people got you back out there going man the market really is good right now let's get going so what's the hold out one back if you guys want to ask got specific question\nIt's got to be reinvigorated re involved and uh and deals are coming to me so it's not like I'm really out there looking for them it's just that being more active again things kind of pop up and I just had my eyes open and\nYou know decide which ones you want to do\nAbsolutely now I'm going to throw in other curve ball at you along those same lines and\nI'm going to put words in your mouth which are knows when sanitary but look at it from this point of view about the time that all this came about you found this deal out eased back where you used to live and it was a good excuse for you to go visit your family\nAnd friends from the past um we started really taking off nationally lifestyles we started doing deals all over the country\nAnd then the concept came to his for the first time ever that you know what all these years people have been coming from all over the country to come to Texas to buy\nAnd we own quite a few properties in taxes I don't know what percentage I'm not going to even guess what percentage I don't know how many units I'm not a good guess but it's a lot of properties a lot of units\nAnd we thought about you know what we're doing now is that we've we've created a very sophisticated base of investors in all taxes\nAnd then we started thinking what would it be like to take the money and the sophistication and the experience that we've humiliated in this group and taken some podunk town has no money no sophistication no nothing or\nWithout being insulted at least they have less experience than we do and to be able to throw that these properties in the markets outside of the taxes market area\nAnd ah you nailed one\nWe've had four or five others have gotten nailed and the last couple of months\nAnd all of a sudden I think what you're going to start seeing in fact I've already seen it is it instead of people coming to road trips in Houston people are flying out of Houston\nAnd Dallas in San Antonio and going to Michigan and going to Detroit Michigan are you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to things and going to ah you know all these different places we had these deals and\nAnd going to Detroit Michigan\nAre you going to Atlanta Georgia and going to things and going to uh you know all these different places we had these deals and they're now saying we opened up a new can of worms here Scott and I you know you see that I think you're feeling that and I think that might have been part of the reason you got invigorated again\n... absolutely so ah and you're absolutely right and my wife and I are first two and a half years that we were married we lived in Cincinnati, Ohio when she got out of grad school that was whereabouts opportunity was so we moved there for a little while before we moved back to Houston and\nBeginning of last year I had went on a big junk mail a\nCampaign and so I started an subscribing to all these things that creep into your mailbox overtime for signing up for various things and I sit on the couch with a a football game or something on she was on the other end of the cash deal whatever she was doing on her laptop\nAnd I was an subscribing and deleting all this junk mail and one of the things that happened a RA which is one of the big brokers here in town and they are national\nUh had gotten bought by Cantor Fitzgerald\nAnd when that happened I had been on their website and I had set preferences so I only got deals into Houston metropolitan area at the time that I started doing this I said why would anybody have to leave a city like Houston there's so much opportunity here to do any of this and I had I stated rule that if I couldn't drive to it and be home\nBy the end of the day I didn't need to own\nSo ah anyway as are sorting in and I didn't ... I was just hitting delete delete delete scrolling through the subject lines the Cincinnati deal pops up\nAnd I went huh and I clicked on it and I very quickly from looking at so many deal sized up that if this was in Houston, Texas it was a no brainer and they would sell for a lot more than the price was on this a posting that I saw\nAnd so yeah I asked my wife what do you think about buying this deal out of town and we've got a\nBusiness excuse to go fly up there a couple of times a year and see all those friends that we left behind Twenty years ago when we came back to Houston\nAnd she sent out whatever you want to do if you want to manage and I said but it means that I've never had to do this but I'm probably gonna be gone at least one night a month going up there just to make sure everything's still running right and she said oh that's fine you know our our two girls were out of the house by this time and we just have one kid left there so things are manageable if you think tried to do it so we ended up doing it\nUm I went to my three uh kinda largest investors that have long term vision and I said guys this little bit of a flyer but will your back you know the steel and they were all in\nAnd we did the deal's been phenomenal the ah we bonded since August of last year\nWe're on pace to return Nineteen percent cash on cash in our first year of ownership Brennan interest only period so things are\nObviously cash along really well but it's a fifty five and over high you'll play a property not not a a value play that we're having to fix up and we kept saying management group intact it was a it was run and we're really well so I saw no reason to shake things up up there we put it a little bit of cap acts and we're making it even more efficient\nSo that when the principal kicks in our cash on cash probably won't have to tip\nWill just a cover it with our increased rats that we're getting out of this place\nSo that's a great place I was actually up there about three weeks ago I guess and they really wanted one of my masters who was from Battle Creek Michigan founded ah lifestyles on the radio show and came down here to invest they wanted him\nAt the Detroit road show that you guys had about three weeks ago and he couldn't be there so I got to go up and be surrogate and help out and really kind of tell his story and how we met down here and now we're investing in other markets up there and\nI got to tell you a J.
