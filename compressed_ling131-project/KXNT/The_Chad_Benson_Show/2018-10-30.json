not normal radio normally give people a little piece of something that each segment you walk into a he's into tower the\nInevitable bite but uh this is something that you're going to need to go to the Web site\nTo go out there in on their own real estate honestly you can own a small apartment complex and on a very busy job you get that management people that take care of it all few hours a week and you're ... you're done but they don't believe that so they want to invest so I had people asking me to invest here's where we need to make it very clear delineation\nMy personal investments have nothing to do with lifestyles on limited I was a real estate investor who started it education and mentoring program but as I educated mentor people I touched people people touched me and they said don't ... I just jump in on your deal\nAnd so when I let people come into my deal had nothing to do with lifestyles on limited he just had to do with okay I'll let your partner and I gave them a fair share of the deal whatever portions of the deal they bought they got\nI didn't take any egregious override or up front the middle of the back beat the construction the manager of the leadership be whatever I just said look I'll take a a disproportionate share of the profits because I'm doing all the work and uh if we make a dollar\nOut there you get your share and I get my share we don't make a dollar I get nothing no fees up front no middle fees know back in the snow sideways fees no nothing I make a dollar\nOr we make a dollar I get my theory is you're\nAbsolutely aligned perfectly perfectly aligned in what we were trying to do you got your share the depreciation I got my share of the depreciation you got your share of the cash flow I got my share of the cash flow you got your share of the capital gains I got my share of the capital gains you got your share of the appreciation I got my share of the appreciation walk\nThe perfect investment as a passive investor now here's what happened with that as that went on other people wanted to do that\nThey say wow that looks neat do what you're doing because you're able to do more real estate deals because you've got all these people putting your money you can grow very rapidly and they saw that they paid attention to that so they tried to do it themselves\nNow these deals they put together with their own deals lifestyles unlimited is a is an education to mentor and prevent nothing to do with us they put these deals together and what happened was some worked in some did here's where the rubber meets the road on syndication\nSome of these guys have put these deals together and I said guys because at the beginning was almost all guys now men and women but at the beginning was almost all\nGuys and they were ... a A R the best salesman I got a pretty face I drive a nice car dress nice and I'm the guy that looks so impressive\nYou want to give me your money and they go out there and they'd raise capital into a deal the problem was some of these guys were bad actors some of them were unscrupulous some of them were idiots some of them had no operational skills at all you\nKnow a salesman ... uh uh I can get your money out of your pocket I can talk you out of anything I Am a that done a ... pretty look it up pretty face Luca ... glows da da da da da\nDa da da da da da da da da ... ... they have no stick with it all\nAnd they would start these projects in the projects would make no money and when the projects made no money since they got paid off of the profit there was no prospect\nAnd so what happened is they just dropped the deal and run away leaving all the people to put their money into the deal high and dry so I guess\nAnd so what happened is they just dropped the deal run away leaving all the people to put their money into the deal high and dry\nSo I came up with a theory I should look this doesn't make any sense what we need to do is real lives of operating these properties is a job it's a business\nAnd so there needs to be a management fee whereas if the guy who's running the deal bales\nYou can buy a management company to come in and run the company and the numbers are right with that management company in there now that meant the deal had to be more profitable than it was in the past or\nThe buyers into the deal had to be willing to take a less or profit then what they were taking before because now there was a guaranteed the coming out called management company B.\nAnd my theory was if you got to management company the and the guys are complete loser you just kick him out or he goes away\nAnd you put in somebody who can operate the property and the property does it you know go to death I mean think about it if you if you\nIf you try to get a measure companies come in there on a deal that you only got paid on profit no management company to do that they want to get paid a fee so now we're in the world sees now we're in the world of people getting paid for sure\nTo do this now you can take people that are not entrepreneurial but just want a job I Want to get paid\nTo come in and do the job coming it'd be a syndicator I called them lead investors lifestyles that's not a real world out there in the real world but I called them the guy that puts the whole thing together I called the leader but that's my verbiage has nothing to do with the real world most people out there called\nSyndicate right so what happens is is that these guys started coming in and now they were getting paid now they can afford to quit their job and do this is a fulltime job will that solved quite a bit of a problem because now you got their full attention on the deal\nBut some people still work good enough some people didn't\nHave the skill sets necessary to do this and like I said the better the salesmen you are usually the worst you are at\nBeing an operator it's just because you're so greedy think about everybody that sells I always laugh and bring sales back down to the lowest common denominator for salespeople and by the way I've been a sales person my whole life but think about\nIf you ever meet a girl that works in a dance is a dancer and she gets paid by\nThe look by the touch by the night she walks out of the five hundred dollars tax free every night you're not going to get her to get a regular job\nYou get a bartender that gets paid five hundred bucks a night in tips you're not going to get that person to ever take a regular job these people that get paid on commissions and especially big commissions instantly and over and over and over again\nThe wrong kind of financing they didn't understand the financing and the financing at all kinds of problems attached to it or in an example that would be\nThe financing was too much you over leveraged defining it's just not enough there was not enough leverage the financing had a term limitation other words you had to get out of it very short\nA balloon note that you couldn't\nFigure out a way to get out of a turnaround\nFinance and get to higher interest rates\nAre the financing had no way to get out of it there was no way to to exit strategy the property all these things were about stuff that these guys did know\nRight then you go on and you have bad promoted or\nPeople that were illegally promoting deals you know these indications are actually controlled by or they're\nLegally supposed to be watched by the FCC there are specific rules and regulations for doing this for raising capital and one of those\nIs not advertising one of those is making sure you have only accredited and or a sophisticated investors\nAnd many of these people are just taking anybody there were throwing people the deal they knew nothing about real estate which you can't do taking people that were not accredited didn't have enough money to be\nAnybody there were throwing people the deal they knew nothing about real estate which you can't do taking people that were not accredited didn't have enough money to be ... credited and value bold enough to get into these deals they're letting people in brothers mothers sons front hey tell your buddies about it\nAnd people were getting into shouldn't get in\nThe didn't understand what they were doing and these people were at risk of losing their entire life savings\nBecause these bad actors\nDoing illegal promotions to get these people in these deals\nNow this is just some of the limiting factors that came out of all this but very quickly very quick myself\nAnd the other lead investors which is what I call the syndicator ... that were good that we're very good we came to the conclusion that boy these bad people are going to wrap our reputation out there in the marketplace now understand again lifestyles\nHas nothing to do with the deals we all know part of the deals we do not promote or solicit the deals we our education and mentoring program but this accumulation of members\nWho are all friends who are all acquaintances we got together and said boy\nYeah these guys continue to do this terrible stopped the people there is going to be some backlash or something that's gonna wash off on a somebody's got to go war all those people over there don't really know what they're doing\nAnd so those people got together the best people we had and they decided to come up with something we call the white people white paper was a set of rules that you had to follow them\nOr you could not syndicate within the group\nOf members that were lifestyles unlimited numbers that we went to our attorneys and said look we don't want to be a part of these deals were these rules are about the\nThe fact that we're all a part of a group of like minded people that all agree\nThat there should be as little risk as possible there should be as many rules in place to protect\nThe money the passive investors as possible the rules also protect the lead because it talks about how you have to operate the property how are you located evaluate the Ghost Ship contract closed operate the property how you pay your distributions what those distributions should be and can be\nAnd what you need to put into the deal so you've got some skin in the day and there's all kinds of rules that protect the passive the leads\nDon't need to be protected they're in control\nIt's the passage that needed to protect\nAnd so our attorney said look you're not in the deals they can do whatever they want their their deals\nBut you can and you have the right to remove them from the membership of lifestyles on limited if there are bad actors if they won't buy all the rules that your group has set up to protect the group\nThe entire group of lifestyles investors then you have the right to refuse the entrance to rack says to the membership you can\nRemove them as a member and so we set up these rules and regulations had everybody by and and everybody that wanted to be as solicitor within the group which side and agree to follow these rules now you have to understand if you do outside and agree to follow them nobody\nWhich side and agree to follow these rules\nNow you have to understand if you don't so I can agree to follow them nobody in the group is going to invest with you because the people that are you are going why would you not sign this which protects me argued that greedy your dad agree just your that arrogant\nYou think you do it so well that you can stick\nMoney without doing it the right way why would you do that\nAnd so lifestyles deals started\nBecoming much much much better than average became better the quality became better\nThe down side deals became less and all of a sudden people were very very happy\nBut then we read into the next level and the next level was information\nThe ... necessary borders leads to do a great deal on these\nInvestments for the ... which I always do it right we needed it education program to prove that they knew what they were doing\nPasses putting money into deals they don't understand having no idea if it's the right deal for them to a dusty that was also when I go back over to share it with a we saw both of those
