looking\nBack to do on the radio show with me here today is Robert Martinez a super achievers two thousand seven hundred and sixty two units sixteen apartment complexes net value of about two hundred and thirty five million dollars with the real estate and he's still just as horrible\nAs that Robert welcome back to the show bread what is it that\nDrives you the most I mean since you started did you did you see yourself accelerating your goals Robert [noise] you've always been a ... you always\nBeen aggressive since I've known you you've always been someone out there say they you know I'm number one I'm going to be number one you're going to have the number two I'm already number one you better that way but you you ... your goals as I've seen you\nDid you know you were doing that is that something consciously you did or didn't just happen to you how you jak yourself up to get up to work harder every day's lesson which is\nYou know I don't want to make a regret though everyone I don't want to be you know eighty Ninety years all you know and I don't know if I'll be like that or a nursing home somewhere but I don't want to be sitting there thinking regret to me that he was like horrible way to be what the white in that unit\nWhy didn't I Hope that person why did I go over here why not changed my mind why not hire\nYou know and it it's just\nI don't want to do that then I think\nYou know associated myself with different you know people you find on on you know Facebook social media types and people are written books on the on the power of yourself and trying to get your thing you know you're you're the best out of you and\nYou know it I Would go back to an example there's always a gentleman in Grand car down with maybe hoping somebody you've heard of um he's a he's a sales are motivators tells coach got started in the in the car business first ah and then got into real estate but he wrote a book called ...\nAnd it and it basically the book was\nUm how much money as a you know he had the example you would ask somebody how much money as a lot of money you and for many people that would say a million dollars or five million dollars and that is that's a really big number but that to a choice to the child or to the family of somebody worth hundreds of millions of dollars\nIs that really a big number\nAnd so when he was thinking what you need the ten extra way of thinking you got to change your mindset ride because you're only going to go as far as your mind is going to let you go and so instead of choosing one million why they choose ten million how can they didn't treat the hundred million um and so it ... the concept is is uh that that you just got to be able to shoot higher because of your goals\nAren't aren't scaring you\nAnd they're not big enough you're not going to achieving at the very most out of yourself so I think that was one of the books that I think I read\nSome time back that maybe a few three four years ago they really woke me up and realize wait a minute you've got disability you're building this machine that's like you know\nBeing able to operate these apartment complexes and generate tons of counter for the investors you know be able to provide for for for yourself and your team why aren't you know scaling it up a little bit you you you can do it you\nKnow do I think you've done the same thing I mean when I joined the business you know when I drove through your group you know you weren't nearly as massive as you are today now you're all across the country now you've got\nOffices everywhere you got members from multiple countries in in nearly every state in the in the country and I mean doing all these great things all because of what they're learning lifestyles right but somewhere along the way you decided you want to rent but up right so I think it's a similar it's a similar a concept\nSo Robert [noise] as you as you look at this thing and you're you're producing this result\nAnd you talk about legacy not want to leave behind something less than what you could have left behind how do you bring your children is in in what age I mean I don't know how old your children do you get a couple of guys but um how do you see bring them kids into this\nBan I my my boys are everything to me I've got a twelve year old and I've got one that just turned ten they're really crazy good soccer players\nUm but what I think I've been able to do for them is that you know like my mom did for me they have an expectation to when they have an expectation to fight they have an expectation to to scrape and do what they're going to have to do and so I think the business I'm you know a has brought that out of me to another level\nYou know I'm constantly when we when we were I pick them up for soccer practice I had a day of work I go get an everyday I take my kids to soccer every time I don't miss that as often as I can I don't think I missed very many games either um and um we're in that car and when I get them I ask them how their day is going\nAnd we didn't talk about it and then it's monitoring how how's it going with me and we sit down there and I had business ... business conversation with him I tell them what's going on I go you understand what I just said you understand why that's important they repeat it back to me and you know we're ...\nJust so much fun when you when you have a conversation with him one day and a week or two later they're like hey that means this and this and that and like yeah that's exactly what that means you know so it was like what did you start lobbied I Love I'm Sorry\nYou start teach what was that the question was like what am I going on for a long as long as\nThey could yeah I I Would say maybe\nI mean we have conversations all the time I think they Saudi ramped up it wasn't by design on TALK of business that I I I think uh\nYou know it's probably been there since they are like five six or seven probably where they could really understand him and say okay so you're saying that daddy owns these buildings right here right he's like yeah yeah you know understand why that is important and we go to the concept\nOf paying rent and working for your money how viable money is and how you had to have somewhere to live in and just you know be able to to to explain the benefits as well you know of only that piece of real estate you know and so it's like they they get it I mean I I have no doubt\nI'm growing up that they're going to be they're going to have a will\nTo want to work with me I'm In the future because I think this is you know the way I Do with my thought I wanted to go I thought I wanted to work or whatever I mean one little boy doesn't want to go work with is that I thought I wanted to have water to my dad was a you know like I was always like either you're not going to be like a white because this is a good enough for you you need to shoot higher\nLike wow really they are yeah yeah\nYou know that it's okay you know when you say we can on a store and all that and and he's like no no you go find your own path you know you so I'm curious to see how that's going to play out in the future I Would love to have them in the business but you know it we're going to have to see how how the card\nA backup later on I'm curious to see if if ah if I push them away way my dad did they can you can do bigger and beyond or but I think that they're going to be the continuation of of of what of what our company is and and the and the legacy behind it\nCan I see a president Martinez someday do other than my hearing we wind up\nYou know it's all funny you know it it was so funny you said that right because I I think you know I I've got one that has so much swag\nRight and he's got so much confidence and he just like man I I think that's an expression what he's going to be president that states where he's going to run a prison gang one of the Chu I figured it out\nBut he just got so he can just inspiring he's like you know the leader of people in his little school right that I could totally see him in that capacity the other one is very straight arrow\nVery like by the book doesn't have as much creativity\nYou know I'm a just does he's a good soldier he's going to go do exactly what stomach due to the best of his ability you know I'm so it's really really funny you said that I can totally see one of 'em um if if somebody puts puts it in his ear and it's something to eat desire that he wants to be I could totally see that\nYou know we're gonna have to develop or Spanish a little bit but I think other than that they're there they got a good shot at it\nFor sure how much time do I have left out on this thing you've got six minutes\nOkay perfect okay so I was wondering if that's the example you were looting too you know when you're asking for like something maybe I could do that you know I ...\nActually I actually wasn't Robert I wasn't thinking of that's been going on that it wasn't okay I I don't consider the solution situation I considered one of the turning point to your career where you told Olson stuffed ... out of you that I'd never heard before\n\nYou know for sure I I think finally said you know reaching you know you go above and beyond the model our model it's up by working class property being the property\nYou know buy properties where my mom was the same as most everybody else as well just some some refinement here and there but we're gonna fix anything that's going to break or the next five years we're going to make sure that there's no reason to move out right we're going to take care of all the air conditions because that's the number one maintenance headache and if you're residents\nIf it's not eighty six degrees in their apartment in August and it's a cause Seventy two\nThey're more than likely to renew right and we make our money and there were new again so it's it's a you know that process it's a little bit different when you're going to throw in a market where everything's already knew\nRight where where they can afford the rent level at that number then they then they can afford the rent that written the rent number at other similar properties which are also knew\nSo I think the the the business model of you know fix and everything that broke in and and get into a new rule\nIs very different than the eight market um I I think I think you have to it's a it's much more um\nThere's a higher emphasis on leasing leasing east seems because you're\nYou're dealing with people who have more options money gives you watch it to be a lack of money doesn't give you often if you haven't plenty of discretionary income and you can be can pay rent or you can choose to buy a house when you're ready or you can choose to move to a different part of town\nYou know you're not locked in I think one of our business models also depending on the schools that that that we that we uh we we like to buy in the suburbs\nSo school but school districts are very important to us you know families to win three bedrooms right\nI think this property that I'm that we we just sold recently you know there was a eighty percent one bit so there's a there was a lack of two bedrooms right and it was really interesting that you guys are always full rights I don't know why they just didn't do it more choose but um you have more one back which means you have more of a nomadic\nI'm ... not I don't know transit that coming up the word but you know more of a of a of a of a demographic that's going to move quicker and that the younger crowd right so as a ... as a you know young people want to meet people that want to couple up they want to ... to get married and move out to the verbs right so I think the model we had to learn we had a um\nWe had we had to play with a model on the fly which um I ... I thought we would go in there and be the low cost a provider\nWhich you know I think whatever occurred I think we got caught in the economics of the economy and what was changing you know when we were doing it under riding on that deal or it was a hundred dollars a barrel only by finally get into the property a few months later we're at Seventy dollars a barrel by December of that year with sixty dollars a barrel\nFast forward a year later an hour at forty dollars a barrel\nSo you know where we had all this monster job growth now we have monster job loss\nAt the same time we had sixty thousand brand new units coming to market which are also planning on that hundred dollar oil sticking around and we're all kind of playing with it draws trying to fight for a a reduced or diminishing rental population so what we learn you know all that just use the back or what we learned we had to work it much better\nThat meant we had to understand how to contact the people that are going to be living with us so number one millennials younger crowd there on the social media is you got to that of your social media game\nNumber two you have to understand that when you had to be there in a fight you on different websites you got to have a good website they expected to be able to pay on line they expect to be able to they don't want to go to the office and drop off the check\nThey don't want to go to the office in writer made made his request some of them are going to do that as they're coming out of the most of my working all day long\nThey don't have time for it and they want to be left alone\nRight so we had to develop this virtual online presence so that as a result that property we develop a twenty four seven call center where they can call it any time of the day when they were they wanted even after hours and they can come in and and get information or\nSet up a tour for another day or they need to train a maintenance requests for the various ideas so that particular property made us better\nMade might be the portfolio better made us ... ... in that that better translated into record performances and higher Castro pretty investors\nKnow we toured you your property and the bus tour you've just added yeah a whole different armed your team explain that to people look down three different people you picked up the you introduce is doing what they're doing for your company no\nYeah for sure so you you actually like well what drives me in a business what drives me is building the business\nGrowing adding the pieces you know competing with the bigger players right and taking market share from them take an award from them take us they do and then I'll turn your spirit and just you know basically shutting it back to them or I really really like\nA building that is a part of that back in December I realized that we didn't have a true marketing group you know I'm really strongest sales and I can I can I can train my girls and how to sell but I needed some help on understanding the online marketing and so we were able to bring on a few people are two of them a a word a um um\nThey were they were writing they were running a ten thousand you know for a photo and they were the marketing arm for that\nAnd I realized that we didn't really have Web sites all we had was like you know kinda like a mannequin kind of like a a shell of what a website was I didn't understand all the Google Analytics and all these other things that were behind the website that they explained to me and like whoa so they told me that that you could get increased leads\nYou had a better website that has certain key words in a way by Robert I'm going to cut you off last year because they're taking us out too but when they come back I Want you to explain to do was\nFeel good
