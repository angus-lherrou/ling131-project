the Dell wants the radio show with Laurie font no and today we're talking about the power of passive income because it allows us to live where we want and invest where we want\nAnd we spent the first segment talking about the little bit about Laurie Ann and her history and moving around for jobs and never really being able to be where you want to be because something is dragging you elsewhere in order to make money\nAnd if you can create passive income that that cash flow that it's coming in every month without you working in that business or working very little in that business\nIt gives you tremendous freedom\nTo live wherever in the country you want to live close to the people that you love\nAnd the things that you like to do and invest where it makes sense to invest in Laurie\nWe've been working with a variety of of national spokespeople from across the United states and some from out of the country were investing all over the United states\nAnd helping them with this concept and we've been doing this for years now we we launch our national program a couple of years ago but it's it's really been\nAbout six or seven years we've been diligently working with people across the country in this process can you tell us a little bit about how it all works and and talk about the national program and how people can actually make this happen in their lives\nAway from family to go move to a an area of the countries that that that meet the model and so\nThat's why we teach people that you can do the model in any city that makes sense in any market that makes sense and so we we teach them the price point you've got to do two things in order to invest outside of your market and to analyze whether or not your market is a good one to invest in or not\nSo I'm going to pick on California for instance because their prices they're home prices are out of the ... out of the sky high and they go through the roof they're with their home prices and in order to get a Nineteen fifties or Nineteen sixties little bungalow you could pay half a million dollars for that\nAnd the red prices went market doesn't support being able to pay for the expenses on a home of that ah that that costs then it doesn't make sense to actually invested in that area\nThat that that's pretty simple and what would normally do as we look at the average price of the house what it's going to have praised for on the market\nAnd we can generally ballpark look at that and say well rent would probably in order for this make a good investment property would need to be about one percent of the price of that house so if you've got a hundred and Seventy thousand dollar house that you're going to purchase for an acquisition by on hold for cash flow\nYou'd want to consider that you need at least Seventeen hundred dollars a month for rent and if people in that area aren't paying that amount well then that means that that house is too high priced for the model\nSo what we do if we look for areas it's great if it happens in your own backyard because that gives us an advantage we're more familiar with the neighborhoods we're familiar with which which areas are good and bad so to speak but\nThe thing is is that we can always if it's not in our backyard and if it's in another city or another state for that matter we can always go and look at that particular market and see what the rents are\nAre we can look at rental calm you couldn't even find that if you you use search just a normal website like real tour dot com or or something like that see what rental homes are going for in the area\nAnd then look at what prices are homes are selling for and then you can put that one percent rule and see whether or not it makes sense\nSo um you get your due diligence in the area because if you're not familiar with the area you'd want to look at crime statistics\nYou might want to contact your insurance agent or get an insurance person on your team that that's in the area and see what the insurance rates are going for so that you can start calculating what expenses would be a for that property\nTo see how much that the expenses on that property you're going to come out of the rent check the tenant will be paying\nSo once you apply the same principles to any market you can find a good market to invest in\nAnd if you can't find um something you know lots of times people get stuck because we want to invest in their own area\nAnd is so many many people are living in areas like you say where the the numbers really don't work out well for rental property which is why many of us live in areas that don't have a lot of renters in the area\nAnd but as they expand out from from where they live they can find many markets usually in a variety of states across the U.S\nWhere it makes sense and maybe there's some on the east coast in the west coast where your numbers are just so high that when you're charging four or five thousand dollars a month for rent your your\nThere are some on the east coast and the west coast\nWhere your numbers are just so high that when you're charging four or five thousand dollars a month for rent you're you're into a dynamic in the market that's that's difficult as a landlord it takes you longer to find tenants even though people may have higher incomes they also have higher higher expenses and so\nThey they get into a situation where\nYou have their traditional tenants taxes\nAnd and toilets where they're really looking at appreciation so maybe you could talk a little bit about our model and how we look at appreciation of as being the cherry on top instead of the foundation of the investment strategy\nExactly well well we all know that real estate is and appreciating asset so appreciation though is I think on the cake you don't want to go into a a a deal\nThinking that it's going to appreciate because that that of a speculative nature that we don't want to speculate on anything we want to run good from numbers and I'll tell you as long as\nThey're our property in the price point to to ah to afford\nTo make a profit off the rent than appreciation shouldn't shouldn't come into play that just simply what ... what you get in the body on hold\nSo for instance if you work you out if you if you go into a a market and it happened to be\nA let's say a hundred ... under two hundred thousand dollars\nAnd you look at that market will say well you know prices are going up at a rate of you know what they're really accelerating\nOur ... and and what you would want to still not go in for ... that's mostly people are just going to speculate on that and there they they run the risk of getting burned you run the numbers the same on every deal no matter which markets\nAnd that's the the fundamentals that allow you to go through the market cycles and I think that's\nPart of what people don't understand about real estate because they've heard the stories about people losing a tremendous amount in real estate during a different bubbles and especially during the the most recent recession which is is fading into history at the moment but I'm causing us to forget\nThe fundamentals of the market that prevent us from repeating the past and that's really what Laurie is here to talk to us about today is\nAnd I have invested in properties their sight unseen but that's a large metropolitan area and so I'm not necessarily familiar with each pocket in each area\nThat does that I Would want to actually have tenants and and I know property and you have to do your due diligence on the city in the area of the city with the methods that I had just a just mentioned\nNow once you've decided on an area then you'll also want to establish a a a team of people who can actually funneling find property for you whether that be a team of of local realtors in the area it might even be a\nConnecting up with an online with some of the real estate investing groups that are in the area and you want to be able to talk to the property\nSo that then you can run the numbers on each deals that that TV to see if it makes sense but that's not enough just to find\nThe property and do that you've got to be prepared to take action once you do find a good deal because if it's a deal it's going to do pretty quick\nSo you have to make sure that you've got everybody they're happier financing lined up\nMake sure that it's a lender that lends in that area because they're going to want to send in a play they're out to the property to make sure everything's value these are all the checks and balances that we can use to make sure that a physician is going to be a good solid sound investments and we're not going to lose money on it\nSo we look for these properties we get our and and we start being are due diligence as I had mentioned earlier we want to make sure of the insurance costs\nOn on that particular area um there there are instances right here in the DFW metroplex where you will do from Dallas County to parents county in the insurance rates are different because parents county happens to have more\nAh more tornadoes and hail damage than we do ... to each specific area you're going to want to hone in on those particular aspects of the property so once you've got your team you've got a lender you're going to need if it's going to be a rehab property you're going to need a good to see a general contractor\nOr maybe you're going to go in with something that's not\nQuite so arduous the fixed up and do it all you need a handyman\nHer or maybe you're going to go in with something that's not quite so arduous will fix up until that we hold a handyman\nYou'll need to check out for schools that are common in that area and these are all done by people are just equal the is it common for foundation problems in that area that might be someone that you want a little too so that they will go out all that\nSo that they can be your ... your ... on the ground for you actually need eyes on the ... someone that's able to go out there for you\nSo we ... white in our own backyards little in our area the things you've got to put in a little ... to establish that ... before you get into a property\nAnd that's I Know that's that's a powerful concept yeah and and ah I I Do share a puzzle that the lone wolf\nA reputation that real estate investors have because we require such big teams in order to succeed you know you've got you've got your lenders your insurance agents you've got your contractors your hand him in the trades you reverse your foundation folks you're\nA plumbers and your electricians and it sounds like a big team to put together but it is not that difficult to put that team together\nAnd holding them together if you do what we learn to do from Dell right which is to treat people while you pay your bills you have good communication you're educated and so you know what you want to do and you can speak with them\nIn an educated way then they enjoy being part of your team they enjoyed the transitions they see you making\nEye in your own business and in each property I should go whether that single family or multifamily and\nYou know you you talk about um getting to know the market at you and I went through an exercise in Las Vegas where we looked at property and in\nAbout an hour we got a handle on that market we learned some things that just delighted us and we we actually had a lot of fun together and evaluating property and we found out wow you know insurance is a lot less in Las Vegas than it is in Texas cities\nAnd you know every area has different things you know Phoenix has been a really fun market to evaluate I've enjoyed learning about Kentucky and um you know we're looking at different areas in St Louis and Kansas City and of course it Lana we've been\nWe have members who have been investing in Atlanta for quite some time and I'm In Detroit since the recovery have been some amazing opportunities as well and each one of those markets has its own its own flavor and so you may have a little bit more\nExpense in one area like they may be a little bit higher and property taxes but their insurance is lower some states are lower in both\nUm and so there are a focus of our attention right it's so as we go through this all look at\nYou know where do we want to invest personally where what markets do we find exciting what markets do we find interesting and where did the numbers work and that's something that I I hear you talk to members about all the time is you can't fall in love with those homes the numbers have to work for you and so Laurie you know\nWhen we when we talk about the numbers that is a way to level the playing field across the country right\nOh absolutely and and that's one thing that we tell people to go out of the goal is getting emotionally it's hard to keep the ... all the time people will when I've got a wonderful properly they say that well I wouldn't want to live there myself at\nYou can support the ... whole market and see that people are one thing that area then that means that the people that are living in that area that would want that how it shouldn't be about you what she ...\nThat area and that one but there are people that are living in that area that was a ... ... ... ... ... a good cool up the bulk like\nI had a a a realtor when I was first getting started and\nHe pointed out of house and I was like whoa you know I just don't know I I same thing right or looking at it on I wouldn't live there and he's pointing at every other house in the neighborhood and he said every single one of these home has a family living in it and this one\nWill to the question is are you the one who's going to
