topic because we all experience it yes fear is a common human emotion and you can\nDrive a variety of activities a righty of responses and how we allow fear to drive those responses it's going to determine the outcomes in our lives and it's up to you and I had talked about before something that's\nIt's in our own lives and in our daily lives are comprised of a series of habits based on our core beliefs about how the world works and we do our sons of things each day without conscious thought\nYeah the first thing that came to mind when when we were talking about this was that experience of deciding you're going to stop off someplace on the way home you're going to stop by the pharmacy you're going to stop and pick up some milk or bread\nAnd you get in your car\nAnd you start driving\nAnd the next thing you know you're pulling into your driveway\nAnd I've had that experience of not even being able to really recollect the drive home which can be a little bit scary when you realize okay I'm supposed to be at the grocery store and I'm sitting in front of my garage and I don't even remember how I got here well the reason that happens is because that that is such an ingrained habit\nThat we are driving subconsciously our mind as busy processing other things and and we're just following that muscle memory home so then we got to pull back out of the garage back to the grocery store and we've all had that experience and that's how much of our life occurs\nAnd breaking out of those habits the\nLonger they've been in place the harder they are and the habits are formed by core beliefs we have about life that we learn\nThe all new radio jog combat is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips and we made it easier than

your fear to drive success and make the changes in life that will allow you to create the wealth and passive income that you need to live the lifestyle that you desire and of course we believe\nThat real estate is the best vehicle to do that and\nSo we talk a lot about that and it's not that we love real estate it's that real estate is the investment\nThat gives us the types of tax breaks I'm the type of a runway that we need dealt talks about it as a train you know the the the stock market goes up and down\nIn a moment based on the news based on emotion real estate is like a train in the distance you can see it coming you can take a base of action and get off the tracks before it runs you over\nAnd I I just just love when he talks about that he's done several several shows using that analogy and it's a it's so true we can see things happening and they don't they don't happen in a moment's notice him happen in a day\nAnd even when the economy changes we don't have all our tenants moved out you know one of the great things about real estate as we all like to have a roof over our heads and that that allows us to to maintain occupancy in our apartment center single family rentals through all\nMarket cycles we talk about the urge Jillian you know as a minute\nWe talked about how we develop those paradigms in life the things that we believe in in your experience what are the things that people here are growing up that create a belief system that makes it hard for them to get away from\nWorking for a company you know the idea that somebody expects they're going to work for the same company you know their whole life or most of their life\nIs should be gone but yet it seems to still be a strong paradigm that they're getting that good education is going to get you that job\nAnd you're going to be able to move up and invest in a four one K. then move it to a self directed IRA and invest in the stock market and retire and I think that's that's still the paradigm I still see articles telling millennials this is what they should do\nAnd where does that come from when people tell you stories\nWhere is this highly and green paradigm coming from in our society\nPersonally I think that the paradigm comes from how your upbringing\nAnd how you were raised I'm I was a very very fortunate individual in the sense that I grew up in a very loving household and I also had the experience of being raised with my grandparents as well so I had two generations telling me of what I should do in order to\nCheck off all the boxes that I'm supposed to as an adult you know the education was very important in our household so went to college and then there was always the conversation about\nHow it's so great when somebody has a job for their entire life or they just hit the ten year that this company or whatever the case may be and there is a sense of accomplishment pride you get accolades for that\nSo obviously growing up in a household like that you want to adult do you want to be just like that you're emulating the people that you were raised by\nThe becomes a situation where I wanted all of those things\nNow don't get me wrong my parents do not invest in real estate um they they support me and my decision to invest in real estate and I think that they are very intrigued um they still also have the fear which is kind of comical because they have seen it first hand how wonderful it is and how much it's changed my life\nUm but it also becomes a situation to where you know they\nAre fearful because they still hear things and they can sample in two thousand nine when the real estate market crash they're fearful in the sense that what if the real estate market cautious again and you're invested in real estate what's gonna happen and I just kind of smile because it becomes a situation where\nYou know I'm not investing in the stock market where everything is just gone with a couple of little checks and a couple of flashing lights all my money disappeared from one computer to another it's a situation where I own real estate and I have rental properties and\nNobody is going to do a mass exodus out of my home because they need a place to live and I've done it right I fall adult math and clean and functional and providing people with safe affordable living so they're going to continue to stay in my tenants so therefore I Will continue to be able to make money no matter what the market throws at me\nI also think that a lot of time people are so scared because\nThey always had the horror stories of you know their uncles neighbors friends rather hot a rental property one's Twenty years ago and it was a nightmare and all of these things went wrong and yadda yadda yadda we all have heard this story every single one of us can account for that\nAnd it's just not true that guy that you heard this story about this hand information just didn't do it correctly he might have on it ... a rental property but he didn't own it correctly or he didn't buy it correctly or whatever the case may be so I think that the biggest push for it\nBut lifestyles are the reason why so many people are able to leave their um comfort zone of what it is that they're supposed to be doing a purse decide on norm or ask for their upbringing is that it's a whole group of like minded people that want a better life\nAs Adele likes to say the only thing standing in the way of a great life is a good life\nSo it's really remarkable to have a huge group of support system family\nA group that lifestyle just because everybody has the same goals and not to be successful and for other people to be successful as well you know I'm the abundance mentality on success is not apply to become thought type of thinking that it able to propel you to the next level\nIt was actually kind of funny because I was having a conversation with my mother the other day and she was talking about her um four one K. and she just you know would put money into her four oh one K. and she never looked at it as do many Americans do because they can't touch it been held their retirement age\nThough she hasn't looked at it and years and years and years and she was looking at it and she was so happy that it had gone up and\n... and it did it went up so like I said it it it worked well for her but it also became a situation\nWhere I started having the conversation with her if she would have invested whatever she put into her four one K. into real estate\nThat number would be ... higher\nBut I think that so many Americans are trapped in the thought process but\nOh yeah it it went up and once again she never talked to she never paid attention to it though it's a situation where if it went up to ... or ... or if it went up a little but she's just happy that it didn't go down and how bad is that you know you work your entire life and save and save and save\nAnd you're just hoping that it's going to be a little bit more than you put in and that's not a way to live a life and that's definitely not a way to plan for your future so it was comical and like I said my parents were very responsible and successful individuals in their own right but it was just kind of comical\nAnd and you hit on a really important topic and when we come back to and I want to talk a little bit more about that because\nHow much is that\nAnd they are really surprised\nTo see how much money they actually paying taxes for one case of the same talk about your mom be excited that her four one K. balance went up well she's been dollar cost averaging into it for how many years\nSo it's going to go up even if the market is is flat and if she takes a hit and that's what's happened you know with your mom she's taken four or five significant hits\nHoover her career to that four one K. and and you had that you know if she had invested in a different investment vehicle something that had a longer you know track so she could see what was coming she would have a lot more money and be a lot more prepared for retirement\n[noise] if you have a question for us give us a call at eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven that's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty two eleven children can you talk a little bit now about\nSome of the steps that people take\nTo overcome their fear to get out of these paradigms and to learn something new you know I I Love something that you say all the time you say you know especially because a lot of people we need are highly educated and they're very very successful in their careers and you'll make the comment of get over yourself and get educated and you talk a little bit about that yeah\n[noise] so send me going into lifestyles and learning the entire um process of real estate investing kind of became a no brainer after the thoughts I Know that sounds silly but I I'm I'm super really skeptical at heart and I'm a glass does happen the kinda guy can take it on any level of gloom and doom\nAnd I'm also very risk averse so\nI understand I fundamentally understand where people that are coming from the UN doesn't for one k.'s and think that\nReal estate is a scary thing because you know they watch those insane HDTV channels where it's like we're gonna flip this house and that's how you make money we're going to take that tells down to the studs and you're going to get off of work and you're going to come here and here to stay here until three in the morning\nBusting out drywall you know that's what people think of when they think of real estate investing and it couldn't be further from the truth [noise]\nSo I decided to take it upon myself to go down my rabbit hole of gloom and doom and try to find the loophole inland sells on limited path I wanted to see where there there was something wrong or\nHow the gotcha I'm always looking for the gotcha so it became very uh parents me pretty early on that there really wasn't a gotcha because I'm In control I'm the one that makes these decisions and in regards to me being risk averse this was a perfect fit because as we talked about earlier\nIf you're investing in a four O. one K. you literally\nOwn money and if you're lucky you have an employer that matches it and then it just you pretend it's not there that is the best course of action because what's going to happen as it goes up it goes down it goes up it goes down hopefully it continues to go up but more than likely it's going to go down\nThat's actually the gamble real estate investing isn't a gamble real estate investing is a tried and true process and\nIt can be improved if you just educate yourself you know a lotta times people come in and they want to talk to me about their fears and their concerns and they're\nAlways looking for the gotcha and\nThe answer is just be informed just be prepared for those situations and that's what lifestyles limited does it prepare people for situation\nUm a lot of times people are scared about things like well how do I deal with this situation is a kind of need me to the toilets clogged and they can't do anything about it and something happened\nHoliday or I I I'm not going to tell you to go get a masters in plumbing just call a plumber that's the logical set up um but it's a situation too where\nWith your correctly educated unprepared for real estate investing you change that toilet out when you bought the house so the likelihood the statistical possibility of that soil it going south on yeah it's pretty slim so you know we if you do everything right from the beginning\nDots how you are able to be successful in real estate investing and you know every single month that when you're trying to it pays the rent you're going to pay that mortgage and you have money in your pocket because that's the path of stream of income that's coming through\nSo in regards to the tax benefits to it it's a life saver you know you're able to take advantage of tax benefits and light off that you wouldn't otherwise be able to if you weren't a real estate investor and then so when you're looking at that\nLying on your tax returns saying how much did you pay in taxes you're just going to start with ... that number down because of your uh deductions in real estate so\nIt is it to me it's I as a risk adverse individual I feel that this is significantly less was more ... I I'm Sorry I feel that this is a significantly lower risk for an investment than just giving your money to an employer but give your money to a\nFour one K. management company and these people just go in and invest in whatever and it goes up and it goes down so\nI I think that this is actually the more conservative way of investing in your future opposed to\nThe conventional paradigms which is kind of ironic but it is true this is actually the safer way\nYeah and and it is because you know again there's those those um miss out there about real estate investing and and that have to be overcome you know thinking about the fears that people have\nOne fear that people have about change is that when I go to change I'm being asked to suspend\nA logic I'm being asked to suspend the the knowledge that I think that I have and and the point that I think you just made us that we're not asking anyone to suspend\nA logic to ... to to ignore the knowledge that they have acquired over life we're asking them actually to go back to some fundamental core beliefs about people and how the\nWorld works and when we come back from this break we'll talk more about that and and we'll get some
