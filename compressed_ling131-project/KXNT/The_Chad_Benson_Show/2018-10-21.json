... financial ... circumstances for example sharing or someone twice ...\nCapital for three by three [noise]\n\n\n[noise]\n[noise]\nIt's a tax free strategy that we're going to talk about and some of the things that we do but before we get to that the website for our our company is tax free planning dot com that is tax free planning dot com the furnace act seals capital strategies\nOne of the things that the ... report does that I think I like the best about it is that it\nYou were from where you're at now currently and that projection and then we're going to analyze that for you and re project and move some of the pieces around so we can maximize those things that are best for you and retirement one of the things\nWere you and re project and move some of the pieces around so we can maximize those things that are best for you and retirement one of the things about retirement that we love about this program\nIs that it gives you a thirty to fifty percent more in in retirement\nIncome available availability to you so it's one of those things that we really liked about it\nWell so this reams report it it answers that the biggest fear out there that everyone has its the longevity of your money is going to last\nLong enough you know\nEven one of the the other thing that I like about it is that the projections basically say we're going to give you that money three to five years longer and that really is comforting for a lot of people when you talk about retirement\nSo if you're interested in seeing that potential growth or increase of your income safely\nAnd see the longevity of your money call for free range report be the first seven colors at eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine\nAnd the next thing we like to talk about are the core principles are one being don't go backwards\nAbsolutely don't go backwards retirement that's the one thing you don't want to do is go backwards\nAnd to make it tax free as possible that's the biggest the out there is is taxes\nAnd three potentially don't um [noise] you need to prepare for unseen financial emergencies and what are those are one can be long term care that can drain your funds really fast um [noise]\nThat's one of the reasons I actually got into the business and you know when I was first married my we moved in with my grandmother she was supposed to be helping us out and then we ended up saying for three years because she couldn't afford long term care\nAnd at that time the dot dot com bubble burst and at the economy just kinda taint and so\nReally she had us that's it my family just they didn't they couldn't for long term care\nWell and I think that's one of the important points that we make and some of these ... as we plan and what we do with the ... report as we develop that for you those are some of the things that are a criteria that are are very important to all people especially those planning for retirement\nAnd uh any time that you have somebody personally in your family that has affected by those things it makes a big impression on you and one of the things that we like to do is and developing that through the ruins report is ah looking at all aspects of your retirement so we don't just\nTake bits and pieces\nBits and pieces right we look at the overall picture for you and then we project out what those costs may be and then those returns that you want to save as we've talked earlier in our conversation\nAbout projecting longer a amounts of money and many of the ... many times what we do is we plan for people to live to age nine to you and when you take a look at statistically may already be longer abs and more and more people are living a lot longer now\nI look at my grandpa he's Ninety five this year\nWow that's incredible asset that is a long life\nIt is\nIt is it's a really long life and that's one of the reasons are these core principles that are important you know my grandmother she was never really educated on on protecting her money um\nAre these core principles that are important you know my grandmother she was never really educated on um protecting her money I'm Susan is stupid I say you know I'd just she didn't know how\nTo make her income last [noise] other than us protect you know coming in and helping\nOne I think that's the experience of many people that age group and so\nI think that's what makes us so unique to the market and actually you know we do a lot of things to protect people the help them look out for those types of things that are going to happen to him because inevitably some of those things happen to your long before death\nThat is true so true so if you want to be the first Senate collars for reruns report give us a call at eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine or go to tax free planning dot com\nAnd ah check this out [noise] one\nOf the core principles we talked about is making money tax free to make it last longer as we've talked about earlier in our conversation so I'm going to let Chris I'm trying to walk you through the the taxable call him all do the deferred tax column and then we'll both comment on the tax free\nTalk about taxes are they going to go up in the future or lower I mean we kind of have a tax break now but let's just look in the future are we going to need more money in the future\nAbsolutely I mentioned when you think about that I mentioned earlier in our conversation about our debt and and how bad that has gotten and when you\nFigure it out of Cornelius money one trillion dollars in debt does anyone really conceive what even a trillion is I Know I don't it's really hard for me to understand it\nI Can't well if you think about okay what century one trillion seconds ago\n... what what was it yeah I I don't you know I really don't know so it's\nThirty thousand D.C\nWow isn't that an incredible thought anything about and we were Twenty one trillion dollars in debt\nWere Twenty one of those huh [laughter] oh my gosh yeah that that scares me a lot so that's one of the reasons that we want to focus on some of this because your partner\nIs the IRS through all of this because as we move forward and talk about taxes\nTaxes can really affect one of the things that we're trying to hedge against with our rooms report and as we've talked about trajectory and moving things forward for yeah the thing that uh that person and I do\nExceptionally well and one of the things that we like talking about is Social Security and that affects that a great deals\nWhile under some kind of water you through the city alone\nIsn't taxable and a lot of people just assume off I see taxes I paint into my sister's security so I'm your tiny ... tax\nYes it can because as these taxable or tax deferred vehicles\nLot of people are really shocked it's kind of a burden or hardship towards and thinking that they're going to have to pay taxes on their Social Security and it can be up to fifty percent or eighty five percent depending on how much you make out of these taxable and tax deferred\nVehicles and and it's it's shocking to them\nThey don't know they they don't realize that all this money that they've saved over their lifetime is going to cause their security be taxable\nThis is why you need a ... report and why we want to help you develop that plan so that your Social Security can be tax free\nAnd ... and so be one of the first seven\nTo give us a call so that we can help you with that rings report and that number to call is eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine again eight seven seven three one seven\nFive nine nine nine our website is tax free planning dot com\nAll right so if taxes are going up in the future what are we doing why are we contributing into these foreign case\nNow no we need to do something and take action we we need to make our retirement tax free if possible and make our Social Security tax rates possible and him were get it that\nWe are that's one of the things we specialize and act feels capitals so give us the opportunity to sit down with you and work through some of those things that are most important to you at retirement which\nIs keeping your money lasting not going backwards if you can make it tax free make attacks\nIt's important to you at retirement which is keeping your money lasting not going backwards if you can make it tax free make it tax free again we're talking about some of those core principles that uh we've talked about earlier in the program\nSo my my question is here if you asked a hundred of your friends what are they going to say about if we need it taxes are going to be higher or not they're all going to say yes everyone we talked to\nThey all say the government's going to need more money and the teacher and they do now and and right now is actually the perfect time\nTo transition your foreign ... into the tax recall him\nBecause we have a reprieve\nYeah the Trump tax cuts are perfect example of why now is the perfect time to do some of these types of planning\nPay iris a little less now over we have about seven years hopefully [laughter]\nWell one of the things that you as you as we are talked about this and as we're visiting um it's interesting how many people procrastinate that day yeah and one of the things that we're trying to get you to understand is that that urgency is is now\nAnd it isn't one of those things that you want to procrastinate that's why it's so important to start to think about those things and why we're we're actually doing the show is so that you hear from us the people that do retirement planning exceptionally well\nAll right so the the next first seven colors Colleen ... before we can help you at call at eight seven seven\nThree one seven five nine nine nine that's eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine\nSo let's let's talk a little bit more about Social Security and some of the things when you file one of the things that I found interesting about Social Security is that they've lost the number of people and haven't been able to replace him\nChristian and I happen to be national security advisors we've taken the course to be able to do that\nWhich actually a security nutrition they only recognize our our a certificate as that's right the only one in the country yeah as being the advisors and you know some of these the the statements that they send out too well now they don't even send them out to you have to print them out yourself\nWell and I you know since I'm ... I'm going to be sixty yeah I'm One of those people that so they start sending him to you at age sixty that's one of the things that you learn you didn't realize the probably the last few years\nYou stopped receiving them and it's because again lack of people lack of money they've tightened the budget so they don't send them out to you any more you may get one occasionally but when you turn sixty you'll start to get that statement each and every year after sixty so\nAnd they only give you three options okay it's early retirement sixty to a\nFull retirement age which does very for different age groups yeah mine's mine's going to be a lot more than yours um I'll probably be sixty eight sixty seven and as um and then you've got a year delayed but you know what's great about the sufferer we is it gives us alternatives we can\nAnd do any age but we [noise] we're the math hey we we're going to get every nickel out of Social Security as we can when we do our now says says security announces for you\nThat's one of the things I Love about the analysis that we do it's very detailed it's part of our friends report we've talked about that but it goes hand in hand with what we're going to help us and again I I'm really\nDetailed as part of our friends report we've talked about that but it goes hand in hand with what we're going to help you with and again I\nI'm really comfortable as I talk about it because I'm at that age where those things become important to you so I think that's one of the things that make ... very different from other companies were very diversified and the people that work for us\nWell and and when we did that analysis and we do the hard core math we're going to show you how we can get it tax free your Social Security and possibly\nYeah absolutely so it's one of the things again that we do extremely well so we want the first seven of you to call us to get that free rooms report\nCome and sit down with us and visit with us about the things that you want to do for your retirement\nAnd the best way to do that is to give us a call at eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine again eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine or you can contact us a tax free planning dot com\nWhat's the bottom line what what what's the nitty gritty here\nWe want that the best outcome in retirement that means what said the nets tenable\nIncome you want the most ... income\nBoy that's that's for sure as I think about my age and what I've got to contemplate being sixty\nIs how much am I going to have what's going to be available to me and how they're going to last yep exactly and that's one of the things as we've discussed and talked about our runs report we're going to concentrate on that not a lot of the other things not your nest egg how big that is\nBecause that doesn't necessarily equate to what you're gonna have to spend and let's face it it's the cash that you have available to you\nIn your retirement years that make life more livable\nAnd you can do the things that you want to do with your grandkids other other things that are like that most of us never have taken the time to really stop and think about how valuable that is to is the time we have to spend with our family and that net spin double income is what we really target for you\nYeah and and you're going to see that in Ross and alert because all your gains are not taxable so that means we can get the nets fan of all income for you\nPotentially absolutely hat that says security had one of the it's the funniest\nPart that we probably love to do when you finally say this is what you're going to have ... to spend so that uh you just feel so good about those kinds of things\nSo we need to divorce the IRS now in order to you had the most nets battling time in the future absolutely give us a call it on a call and get a free range before it's the the first seven colors at\nAgain you don't even realize that it can be taxable so one of the things that we do extremely well at ... capital is walk you through those things that Social Security\nAre so important to you and understanding how to use and to get the ... out of your Social Security\nAnd it really kind of goes back to our core principles like in the first thing that we talk now go backwards market military you don't want to get accurate here make it tax free and pasta and preparing and unforeseen financial emergencies which are going to happen and they they happen throughout your life\nAbsolutely they do the uh one of the things that we just want to just in my explanation\nOr a lot of times it isn't death that takes the person it's that long term disability they've got to go into a nursing home or they have to have hospice care there's all kinds of things that you need to be planning for and so that's another part of what we do I think very effectively is that we have\nA good program and plan to kind of help you with those things well what happened with your mom\nWell and so my mom had to go to work she'd never worked none of those she had she had to learn how to go in and and start to work so\nThe interesting thing about that is my dad was fifty six years old and my mom was only thirty eight oh wow so think about the the only Social Security she got was for the kids yeah she couldn't draw on her own then minor yeah yeah and so my\nThink about the the only Social Security she got was for the kids yeah she couldn't draw on her own the minor yeah yeah and so my sister and I my brothers were older so my sister and I were the only Social Security that she got\nAnd back in that day back in Nineteen Seventy obviously yeah it is not a lot so\nMy mom had to go to work and she hadn't done that and of course we worked my sister and I work\nAnd you contributed we contributed yeah yeah different ... different generation it out right now that's right very different well call for a free consultation visit and get a free rooms report give us a call at eight seven seven three one\nNine fifty nine Ninety nine that's eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine\nGive us a call [noise] well another another um climbed that I was thinking about as the average Joe oh actually I've I've met a lot of clients like this where they just you know they start working\nAnd they meet up with their age are you know we're at and they say okay oh we have four one K. program you want to be in it you know yeah sure okay I guess you know they just don't really understand it and um they sign up for it they know maybe they have a match\nSometimes they don't and they usually over funded because they think well this is my retirement right and they just take it straight from my salary you know and I check\nEvery two weeks it's not going to be a big deal I don't see it won't make a dent in my income and they let it sit for forty years\nFor a long long time we run into that all the time all the time where people have not really even paid attention to what it's doing it in a market like to do when we know that it's been up\nWe'll look at four O. one case for them and take a look in the growth a lot of times many times is only growing up four percent or things you know 'cause they just don't know what to be in they really don't think they've never made that\nPhone call because typically for one case have somebody that will kind of give them a little bit of advice I have to be very careful about that advice they'd yeah so\nYou really have to know what you're doing and one of the things that I found because obviously I had a four one K.\nAnd you just don't pay that close attention to it you just know there's money going into it and you really don't pay a lot of attention to it so that's one of the things we do really well we help you understand that that four one K. is not in your best interests\nYeah it's so true and you know so I kind of educated on um on risk and versus return 'em on normally\nI draw is on the board so it's going to be ... hawking about it\nWhile it's fun to because you can now imagine so draw your line on board for them and then kind of\nTalking about is All right so so I Do one through ten okay ten being the most risk and and it's I\nThink about it like drilling for oil and your backyard or African diamond mines diamond mine my right now to do and I know\nAnd but it's high very high risk Ken is like the ultimate ... okay and one being you know you bury your your savings or money in the backyard of or or put in your masters now there's always risk one is still on the risk skills so when your house could burn down\nUm someone could Rob you were say you get dementia and you don't remember where you buried it so there is still a slight risk um I like to say that because there's risk in all things getting in your ... [laughter] ...\nYeah so there is still a slight risk um I like to say that because there's risk in all things getting in your ... [laughter] average risk everywhere All right so you know the perfect\nA century as the century two thousand till now was an aide to lead genius on Eighteen um [noise] over that than the average that I think he will look at the ... five hundred and well let's let's try and figure out where they are on the wrist scale good idea I mean\nMost people will say it's five to seven so you're kind of in that middle range of risk\nSo think about your line she's drawing the line you're looking at it she's got you in the middle now with a five to seven\n[noise] All right and the average over let's say two thousand two thousand eight Eighteen sorry I'm is six point five percent that's the average that the S. and P. five hundred makes in that five to seven range came\n[noise] now it's a perfect example because we've had in October of oh seven 'til march of oh nine so that includes that two thousand eight drop we had a big big drop in the market absolutely um and a lot of people experience that so that's Eighteen months of your life\nHow much did we lose and that that Eighteen month\nPeriod and you know ... ... and here's that hits home for me because uh my wife four one K. we had a substantial amount of money in that four one K. and it virtually walked on nearly half yeah it wasn't quite have hers happen to be one that was a fairly good grower oh that's good and and but again that's not\nCalm but but still so in that Eighteen month period it was negative fifty three percent\nI like to joke and say the four one K. went to uh to okay why not try or they were they were cut in half so many you've had two oh one K. is\nNow a lot of people so\nThey were like well it's okay I was in bonds well bombs even lost money in that big drop it was about negative Fifteen Percent so generally you know they they're opposite usually ... through but because of how severe\nThat that market loss was effected everything um and so that's the risk you know it\nIt's we're we've had ten years now but my question is when did it come back to broke when it came back to O. seven up your value and your ... to ... you know do\nYou know it's just starting and oh well that's ... yeah it was two thousand twelve it feels like to me so five years a long time and so last\nYear's watch your money and if it doesn't grow for five years it takes you really are irritated with\nThat you have to have a recovery to get back to broke basically and what's what's even worse is those people who were in their seventies they had to go back to work I'm a chance to go back to work just to get back to broke\nAnd again remember if you want a free rooms report give us a call a first you have to set up a free consultation ... give us a call at eight\nSeven seven three one seven five nine nine nine eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine for that\nFree rinse report you just have to set up a free consultation\nSo Chris and let's get back to your imaginary line and you are right there and you're in that five to seven\nWell since the turn of the century what was the reward it was six point five so what's the ...\nOther than well since the turn of the century what was the reward it was six point side so what's the average rate of return in two thousand forward it was that six twenty five percent and that's not at\nThat rate of return by any means but how much did you have to take a absolute with a bunch so again there's nothing wrong with that that six point five\nAverage now we just need to mitigate the risk that that's what we like to do we like to get to see that one to two percent on that scale\nThat's what we specialize in that range report remember retirement max musician strategies\nExactly and again you don't want to go backwards and that's really what we're seeing here\nYeah and then I think about the line 'cause we usually take on that risk gal when we're when we're there we're now back and going to mitigate that to that one to two percent risk so we help them and that risk so that's\nThat's our line has we've drawn up for you and kind of explain to you how that all worked and what we do is such an important part of what we do at ... capital so keep in mind as we've talked about these things and as we've talked about examples of people that we've helped along the way", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Chad Benson Show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "21"}
