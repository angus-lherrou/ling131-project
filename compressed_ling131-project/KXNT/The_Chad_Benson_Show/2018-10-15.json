[noise]\n... ... one of the gateway show on live every Sunday evening from six to seven PM is great pleasure to be here with you live and be alive both things are\nAnd I just want you know and I'm here with river and Ernie and beverage and it will be joining us in just a few minutes and what you know it's a great great pleasure to be here with you I'm an attorney some practical offer forty one years now\nAnd I've seen just about every story you can imagine as that but I suppose I'm going to hear new ones all the time to you know what as long as they do this business I'm always hearing new things and it's always an opportunity I I really enjoy reading the new people to come see me\nYou ever want to get in touch with me at Las Vegas attorney or just look me up at Las Vegas attorney dot com is one word Las Vegas that journey dot com or give me a call seven oh two three aid for three four seven I Do injuries and accident cases\nAnd you know it's a I I ... I really do learn every week you know it's interesting when the ideas of this whole show is that there's different ways we can approach our life\nAnd find greater satisfaction in fulfillment\nAnd I've applied that in my law practice so that even though the impacts me for forty one years somehow I'm Still able to find a quite a bit of a lot of a joint inspiration from it but I learned to connect with people that come in to see me\nNot just as another business opportunity but as another human being whose life I'm crossing with and I hear\nEvery single week every kind of story you can imagine you know people can come in and nice young a nice young lady came in her father she and her father and a bad accident and he was in the hospital and had very serious injuries and so I get to work with them and it get to work them through that and there's there's all these different kinds of issues that you deal with all the time\nOr sometimes there's sometimes not even related to the the accident I'm helping them with and I just they you know somebody may have been laid off at work and they had a dream to do this one thing and suddenly their\nFeelings were hurt and they suffered an emotional blow by being laid off for the for no reason that they knew of and I get a chance to give them some ideas of how they might be able to move forward in their life so for me working as an attorney the way I've been able to make it more rewarding\nUsed to have a deeper connection with people to hear what they're learning what what's going on with their life\nUm I I Do that by the way not just with my clients but also with the people I'm working with a justice and the other side attorneys and the other side and uh you know heading to just to bring me a paper work this very we'd make a special trip to my office and bring it to me just because he's a very polite nice guy\nBeen in the business for a long time and he wanted to he's about to go in for a major operation himself and we just wanted to visit and then when he finished his operation we'll get together for lunch but the point is is that it's taking it to a more personal level and that's what makes it a more rewarding experience in almost every one of us has an opportunity to do something like that in our lives\nMatter what our career job is so it's and I don't want to invite you to stay tuned I'm it's nights about how to\nHow to turn our adverse cities into victories\nHow to turn a how to succeed against all odds but or it wants her to put how to turn our ... our scars into stars you heard that saying before\nHow to turn your scars into stars and he says Robert ... of the first time but the idea is you could take the things that have been negative in your life\nSomething that has major life more difficult more painful or more frustrating and somehow turn it into a doorway or gateway isn't the show's called into new possibility into new possibility and that's the hope for all of us really I mean that's the hope no just not only just for you and I\nWas ill for all of humanity really\nIs how do we take a world that's got all sorts of different issues going on has always you know it's interesting I I like to study history and uh you don't have to go back far at all but you know we've we've the world's been filled with challenges and conflicts and [noise]\nThe different issues of the world I mean it that we all know about and yet in the same world there have been people who are always\nTo reach for a greater truth\nDared to reach for God\nDared to make their life means something more than the ordinary\nAnd that's the show is really about an invitation to you and to me\nAnd each person participating to make our lives into something extraordinary to reach beyond the ordinary into the extraordinary\nAnd the first step in that of course\nIs even open yourself to the idea that there is an extraordinary part of life that there is a presence of power of grace and goodness it transcends assault individually\nInfinitely beyond our understanding\nAnd the disgrace a ... for the for the Christian and showed up in the form of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ but there's many many people start in different ways in different\nPlaces on the journey of life\nBut here's here's what I Want to say to each of you very first step\nHas this very conversation with a lot my very dear close friends\nJust giving up the idea that you're just a body\nAnd giving him the idea they were just going to be here for a few years that's it is all over\nIn rather opening yourself the idea that you're part of a ... a vast plan but infinitely intelligent universe and presence of God\nIn his very presence of God is knows you better than you know yourself\nAnd sometimes it doesn't seem that way and sometimes that doesn't seem that way at all and we we might question a hundred percent\nEspecially if somebody shows up the base of adversity very severe adversity young man came to me just in the last few weeks that\nHis father was killed in an accident well how you only like Twenty one I mean how how are we going to really trust the infinite presidents have gone\nWere were given the opportunity to reach beyond the ordinary into the extraordinary from the mundane and the average life\nThat somewhat meaningless and or in the ... that can be meaningless I'm not saying it's always meaningless but can be into creating a life of profound profound\nFulfilling meaning [noise]\nSo that's that's really what\nThe exploration of life is to me and I'm Talking about how it tonight how to transform your adversity into victory\nHow to succeed against all odds had to turn your scars into stars\nBut in reality none of that is going to happen\nUnless we have some kind of connection\nTo got an infinite\nOf course there's been thousands of religions through the beginning of time [noise]\nNow I each each one of us has to kind of begin to explore way through that the first step by the way it's just the realization that there is something greater than yourself\nThat's kinda the equivalent of up that plant just starting to send out a shoot just starting to send it out\nHey maybe maybe I'm not alone maybe there's something more to this life maybe there's way more than I ever imagined\nAnd then as we send out that exploratory shoot\nExploratory branch\nThen we read out leaves and begin to open ourselves to more and more unfolding\nIn for the person who accepts a Jesus Christ than we are accepting the grace that he brought to the surface which is called the Holy Spirit but but the very first step even before you get there\nIs giving up the certainty\nThat ... that you might have in your mind that there is no God\nYou have to at least be have the openness if you could interview a seed\nDoes maybe caught there in the in the darkness underneath that pavement\nAnd there were two scenes talking and\nAnd it's kind of a bit of a stretch here\nBut there were two seats talking one might say\nWhat do you weigh your bothering with anything can't you see with the world that we are confronted with his dark underground\nAnd there's no light why do persist and knock him out of the things and the other so you might say something like yes but\nSomething tells me there's something beyond this there's something more there's something greater\nThe one said that says there's something greater just decides to reach up and push up through this seemingly impenetrable pavement and sure enough and the other side of that pavement which would seem to be an impossible thing to get through there is like the sun and that send begins to transform that that seat into a tree\nIn your life [noise] so how many of us are like that how many of us are like that see that says there's nothing beyond and I just have to get used to what it is and then and then what we can do if if that's what we think life is nothing more\nWe're we're forced to kind of take our\nOur pleasures in\nMaybe drugs and\nIn distractions and things like that and there's nothing wrong with some things in moderation I'm not even saying that but the point I'm saying is didn't life becomes just an attempt to escape I heard I heard a very well known comedian I'm I won't mention his name um but I actually\nIt is and he's a he's on the TV even today he's got a show\nAnd I'm not here in Vegas but his his national show\nAnd he he he's an atheist and listen to atheism is stage of life to say there's no condemnation that I Do not believe anyway but here's what I Want to say\nSo he's saying to the whole group you know\nI don't think life as any meaning is just a big distraction the time you're born into the time you die and so he's going on in it it got even worse than that but I actually don't want to repeat some of the things he said what the point I'm really getting\nAt is so in his life there's no meaning\nIt's a purpose let's existence and there's only ...\nYou know there there's no value at all or human existence other than the distractions you can have a now I think he's loved by God as much as anybody\nAnd I was obviously at this point in his reality it just doesn't seem real to him in somewhere he's made a decision that God's not real but here here's what I Want to say to you\nHopefully if you're listening to the show\nYou're at least be willing to be like that\nGrade you see that says yes it is dark around here yes I Am does seem like there's even some big obstacles in front of me like I see some stuff that\nCould be called pavement that I don't even know I could possibly get through\nIs much thicker and bigger than I Am but you know what I'm not going to let that stop me I'm going to keep reaching out anyway and you could be that where you can be the other one says I'm much smarter I Know better there's nothing there is a waste of time\nAnd just days down there and\nUnderground and ever and nothing ever comes of it [noise]\nSo the question is which do you want to be do you want to be the seed that Germany that grows that takes off\n... gives it give birth to a whole tri then then the tree gives birth to fruit and a begins to feed other people ... and it becomes a source of life all by as active life courage reaching in through the darkness into the light\nSo when I'm going to say to you tonight\nIs that that's the choice you and I have to make [noise]\nAnd it starts with a simple willingness just a little bit of crack now just like their\nNew took a little cracks that pavement for some light to start to get through and then that she could pull through it but you have to let your own brain open up your own mind\nI'm not sure and I don't really know how life happens I have no problem saying that the reason I'm I've encountered lots of reverse was in my life and I realized that uh we're always learning in life is learning journey [noise]\n\nSo the question then is for each of us is\nWhat could possibly change the quality of our life in a way\nThey can make a life much more rewarding to be a part of [noise]\nAnd that's my invitation each of you\nOpen yourself tonight\nTo to be willing to admit that maybe\nYou don't have all the answers\nAnd that's true equally true of me by the way if I think I have all the answers and I'm In trouble [noise] the second I think I have all the answers I Can't learn any more [noise]\nAnd so tonight I Want to join with you and just being saying\nLet's open in this journey are called life\nThe grand exploration which is an exploration of God of life and something infinitely beyond normal human life\nAnd as soon as a as if you and I can begin to make that real not just a story\nAnd as a not a pretty wish\nBut an actual discovery and realization\nThat you know what [noise] than we are going to have the opportunity\nTo experience life in a totally different way than the ordinary and what's once might have seen meaningless and dry and and I liked that comedian I was talking about we just you know just a pure distraction\nWill begin to be infused with meaning and purpose in life and this and so if we want to begin to turn our diversity is into victories the first step really in the most important step is to be willing to say I need help I Can't do it myself and can you help me God and you can use the word you want to use for that\nGod will eventually\nSteer what you need to be steered to you when you need to have a year to you\nBut to start\nBy saying in humbling yourself to say I need help I don't know how to live this life is life has been on my my understanding inability not only that but sometimes things happen or painful or\nOr you know they're scary are fearful I don't know how to I don't know how to put it altogether God surely don't know how an honest admission like that that is what opens us launches is on the journey of transformation\nLetting the spirit of God's gonna change just as human beings\nSo the very first step is just that willingness to step your journey on this earth\nAnd then with that is to them begin to say well what purpose might I have to dedicate yourself their purpose greater than yourself\nAs you begin to dedicate yourself to a purpose greater than yourself suddenly a lot of your normal problems fall away [noise]\nHere's something you'd probably never knew his you know than in countries where they go to war like they've discovered that ... many of people's neuro sees go away they go away why because suddenly they can't spend any time worrying about things they are literally focused on surviving\nAnd they've got bigger purpose which in this case unfortunately was created by\nBeing caught in a a a a a conflict of military conflict so the point is though if we can find out now you find a positive example that\nYour whole life can be changed so I I invite you tonight to open yourself that there's a purpose for your life is infinitely greater than you've ever dreamed up and I invite you to just be willing to humble yourself or is it for the infinity of God and\nUh for me that's that includes the Holy Spirit of a Jesus Christ and to\nOpen ourselves to that transforming experience\nBut if you either have a little bit of willingness just that's all that just the littlest bit if willingness to open your heart and say I don't really know but I really want I Know there's more to this like life is designed to be something vastly greater and better\nThan what we normally consider\nI Know that in my heart that you kind of know that in your heart I Know that in my soul this life is meant to be for each of us something glorious really glorious wonderful\nAnd I used to do is look at a pretty sunset to be reminded of that are looking at a smile a baby's face you know I have these different people come in with their babies into my office and see these little babies are filled or big smiles on their faces here's the thing\nIn the world has the potential to bring ... great great\nJoy and purpose and meaning in fulfillment\nThe question is are you and I going to reach for that\nAnd I'm not going to say it's going to be free from somebody versus in reverse those but if you're reaching for something greater than all of that\nThen it'll pull you through it and transform those things along the way so start one with the willingness\nJust a willingness to let God operate in your life too with prayer reach out in affirmative prayer and in ... in my opinion I heard this from a minister many years ago and I agree with this pray out loud at least in your own room you know in your own closet I mean\nAnd I actually have a closet and has in fact we're we're having to pray and some of the time but but pray anyway Bree in your car driving to work but the point is pray and reach out to go out and say you know I don't understand you know and a lot of things don't make sense to me I if you really real\nOr why does this I've some dear friends like this I've known since elementary school\nWhat they'll tell you is um [noise] they just don't see any evidence of God or I Know somebody in their nineties that he I've had this conversation too and he says well where it's got ... percent making things better in certain areas\nSo for those some people that makes it harder for them to know God there's no CNN that is no kind of nation that those questions at all but just\nGuy on your present okay God\nThere's these problems how come if you're really real how come\nYou've let me flounder how come\nYou caused by mother tests\nOr how come you know whatever you think is not right how come you\nLet wars go on how come you that disease go on\nIf you're really real early infinitely intelligent God where is the evidence don't be afraid to pray that in convince those prayers directly to God\nAnytime we start in a prayer relationship to God it's very very critical we will it be willing to be honest about our feelings or do we be willing to uh give everything to God and if you there's maybe some people just talking to a friend of mine came over here\nAnd he was telling me that in Alcoholics Anonymous lot of the people of anger towards ... and it's one of the first things they start to share when they get to the groups and so if you you might have some residual unconscious anger or even conscious anger towards God give that to God to\nExpress it to God I went to a grief group when my father passed away is Ninety nine and a ... a church I went to and that's one of the things they said is is very very normal I Know I particular because there wasn't angry because my dad lived a long list I couldn't really be angry about that\nBut on the other hand some of the people there were angry because things have happened maybe somebody had been lost in a car accident or something\nOr maybe they felt like they they've been treated kindly by somebody or wrongly and so\nThose are things that are fair and right in your prayer life was God to give everything but it's very exciting when you begin to transform your life when you start daily prayer\nDaily prayer guess what\nYour life is going to change forever 'cause you've now plugged yourself in you've ... you've initiated in integrated Iraqi lives change\nSo let me just say let's see what do we had her time was we got about a minute I have to break so I just I Want to ask 'em so Jim me ask you ask you something first Janet ... there's only a minute or so but it by minute and a half so what kind of prayers do you like to do how do you like to say I never really prays differently [noise]\nWell I like to pray the prayer before I get out of bed in the morning\nFor that sets the tone for my whole day [noise]\nAnd then if given throughout the day if something comes up and I think I needed to play again for then I Do\nWant to see like an endless round on your okay there you are and also when I go to bed in the evening same thing she likes to say a prayer\nOkay yeah I forget
