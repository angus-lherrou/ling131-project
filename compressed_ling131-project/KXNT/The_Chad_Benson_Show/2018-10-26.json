principles on notes they bought a a a their own property as the lead with many of their partners as well\nUh and then they branched out to become independent rental owners but they certainly had a strategy in a calling to transition from that professional lifestyles a dentist\nInto real estate investors and now they're not only investigating taxes but they're reaching out into other areas of the southeast\nAre dug into Jennifer welcome to the show and I believe there is some professional you're talking to\nYeah well hey Jay be glad to be here and hope that any information we can give might be helpful to anybody listening I Can't be\nI doubt hey girl tell us about that transition you've been through in and the map that Dell is\nGiving you well or as we've talked before I got injured severely back in two thousand fourteen and couldn't practice but most of the year so Jennifer and I knew we needed a new plan we already had two single family\nHomes that we were renting we knew that was working but\nI invite my colleague that come out to the case study so that they can be a different view of the world are we were fortunate because we had the two single families when I was injured so we knew that was bringing in money\nWe just didn't know how you could tell them\nThat are not the point I'm trying to make your point I'm trying to make it before we have to move on\nIs that most highly compensated individuals do not have a backup plan would you agree with that I yeah I Would absolutely\nWell I'm Glad you did and I'm Glad that you work through yours and Jennifer thanks for supporting I mean that's the\nThe recommendation Doug ... or the the the praised I gave you is wonderful for both of you it's a great time really appreciate you coming on and for everything

deals totaling six hundred and sixteen units and um it puts me in the best possible position and I'm sure it could do the same for everyone else\nAnd\nThis real estate environment I Know you're the
