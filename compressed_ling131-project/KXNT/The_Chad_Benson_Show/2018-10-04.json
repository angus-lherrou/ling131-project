today or by some guy that just doesn't look like he's what he thinks he is a which is a personal business code because he's saying things like uh don't set a realistic goals don't set to many goals less is more\nFocused important and always talking about how to get across town from my job today I mean this is unrealistic is what it was all about\nYou had been given a set realistic goal from your childhood don't do this don't do that do play in the street you get hit by a car all this messaging you got your entire life leads to a life of quiet desperation think about the lives that were older your entire life don't play in the street\nSo you tell your kids do planes street what do you do\nYou take away their ability to get anywhere because now they're afraid of the street when the truth of the matter is you walk out in the street you can play it at all you want as long as you look you left to look to your right who's cars only come from two directions and you watch for big noisy things coming at you then you can play industry do you want\nWell the same thing is to take your money put forward came ... irate because it's safe and you ... what you've done as you've taken away the vehicle you take away the vehicle to where you want to be like the wealthy successful financially you can't put your money to for what I write\nSo you've been told your whole life to do these moderately yes\nThis is expected of using now go and spend your money on the house and the car now your card house broke and then you get yourself a baby and then you get two babies and three babies and now you baby broke and then you're raising these kids in your life is miserable you get up every day you go to work and you're suffering you have a miserable life you come home and\nAfter the boss Katie crap all day long you come home and the kids give you crap and your wife gives you crap and tells you you got to do all the stuff you don't want to do and you're tired and you're busy worn out that you can't do any of it and you know your kids loved you until they get to be about fourteen after that\nThe older they get the dumber you get and so you have all these things going on your life to make your life miserable but every day you got to get up in the morning go drive for an hour to get to work and then work all day long and drive for an hour back\nAnd all this time your money's already know money you're developing no savings or not get any closer to being retired and you realize you have to do this for the rest of your life and then it happens\nRight if you're just you're you're almost nervous breakdowns at this point what you do is you need somebody you love you 'cause nobody else's loving you and so you get yourself a dog and the dog loves you when you come home you got somebody loves you problem is you got to pick up its towards in the backyard so he's believing you crap everyday to now now you got more people give 'em your crap\nAnd you do this for thirty or forty or fifty years\nThen you get to the end\nAnd you go I did it I ... what I set out to accomplish I did what the plan was to do I got the kids through college they're out of college\nWe're empty nesters don't really know my wife anymore we really don't have any type of relation anymore but we'll we'll get it back will tend to look back now which she's so old that you know I don't even really want to look at it and I'm so out of shape that I really can't do anything if I did\nAnd you know we'll get back we'll try to live sixty five years or life in the next five to ten years\nOf our elderly lives\nExcept for one problem we don't have enough money to do that so I'm going to have to continue to work part time or or if we do have enough money to retire it's just barely enough and we will not be able to travel the world because we don't have enough money to travel the world we're just going to have to live frugally and go to dinner at four o'clock every day to get the seniors discount right\nThat's life\nAnd that was well late plan that was a serious set of goals that you had for your life\nBut there are mediocre\nWhat good is to set goals that are mediocre this guy is so crazy so\nOut of it that he's teaching\nThe same lies everybody else in life teachers\nWhich is less is more don't set unrealistic goals wow\nAnd by the way don't set more than one goal\nRight like you shouldn't have a goal that by the time and during my entire Thirty years of working I could stay physically fit that I could create and maintain great relations with my spouse then I have a great cetera relations with my children\nThose goals are too many you can't have them all you got to get that money that you can retire with you got to get that forty years of work under your belt you got to have that big house and you become house poor you need two or three cars eat for college degrees little Billy can't even read or write and he's going to college\nBecause that's the goals that were set up yes my friends you have a set of goals and they are wimpy they are realistic aboard you really want him\nJust because you can be wimpy does it mean you have to be wimpy or that you should be wimpy\nWe all have the capacity to live a mediocre\nAfter be wimpy or that you should be wimpy yes we all have the capacity to live a mediocre life a life of quiet desperation we all have that capacity but does that mean we have to use that capacity does that mean we need to live down to society standards\nI don't think so\nI firmly believe that you need to shoot for the stars you've got to go for something big hey I'd rather go for something big and not get their missed the stars and hit the moon than to go for something moderate that I can achieve\nYour way better off right\nSo to do that we go back to the questions you have to ask the right questions how do I retire in five years now didn't thirty five or forty or fifty years you have to have a timetable and it has to be an unrealistic one\nAnd that's what people do when they called the last ... I'm going to retire and five years or less\nYou have to say I want to retire making more taking home more cash than I take home from my job I don't want to retire because I'm living poor no I understand that I make a hundred thousand dollars a year but I only take sixty thousand dollars a year home\nThat's all I take on that is what I live on after taxes and my four one K. contribution and everything else that comes out of my ... so what am I going to do\nI'm going to take home sixty five thousand dollars a year of tax free income and keep it all\nNow why one sixty five thousand dollars worth because I Want to do better than what I did at my job\nI took home sixteen now wouldn't take I'm sixty five so I've got these financial goals but at the very same time I'm accomplishing these goals of the next five years I Want to lose twenty five pounds and I want to keep it off\nAnd I don't want to do something I don't enjoy to do it so I'm not going to do a starvation diet or joined up for one of these stupid diet programs I'm going to learn\nTo eat\nThe moderate way that I should to not only lose the weight but to maintain that while eating foods I enjoy now that's a good goal I'm going to learn to work out in a way that keeps me fit\nBut in a way that I can enjoy so I can maintain it for the rest of my life I'm going to work in one or two date nights a week with my wife I don't care that we're so busy with our kids one night a week\nAnd that's because they've employed this capital to do something\nRight now the problem is some they might even be making deals to make a hundred percent return on a real estate deal but a hundred percent then is divided out across the\nEight hundred thousand dollars with the net worth and it doesn't really mean anything because it's a very small percentage so they have lowered this return even though they're out there doing stuff that's very successful investments\nBut they lowered the rate of return on those investments by having too much actually so the number one thing that kills an investor is dead equity that's money sitting there doing nothing\nWhat are the worst culprits the worst culprits are your personal residence your four one K. and your IRA now I Know you think that you've got\nFour hundred thousand your IRA or your four one K. I'm Sorry you don't\nBecause you have to give up half of it to take it out even if you're waiting to your six fifty nine and a half you still have to pay your income tax rate on that money to get it out\nSo you don't have what you think in there so it's really kind of delusional you are you thinking wow this things making me money but it isn't\nBecause you never got it if you don't get the money you aren't earning the Monday This is something you have to understand in Chile you earn money and get it where you can spend you having to say well it's on a piece of paper called my four oh one K. and I see that numbers on that piece of paper getting larger sure and they will into the day they don't\nAnd that day they might go backwards on you\nSo you can't say well I was up to five hundred thousand down down to three hundred thousand so but I made the two hundred that no you never made the two hundred thousand guys\nThat's the problem\nYou're not seeing it for what it really is\nYou've got to get that personal residents which you got four hundred thousand dollars you personal ... of your life savings in that house what does it or knew nothing\nDo you still have to pay taxes you pay the mortgage but do you still have to pay the taxes you as you still have to pay the insurance she asked you still have to pay for maintenance and repair yes you still have to pay them you know get to spend time and money to ... to ... whatever that maintenance I guess\nAll of that stuff\nBut you haven't earned a dime by paying it off none if you get sued\n\nBut you haven't earned a dime by paying it off none if you get sued\nAnd it's not your personal residents say it's a rental property they can take it away from you\nIt's just the thought of paying off the house is so common yet so ignorant in every way shape and form there's absolutely nothing logical about paying off your personal residence\nOther than this and this is the one logical one and that is you've got so much money cash to invest that you can make the income that you want to make with the money you have liquid\nAnd not need the money in the house but if you cannot make with the cash you have available to you enough income to retire and live the way you want then that money sitting in your house is killing you know let's talk about the guys on the radio the other day he bought nine houses over four years\nAnd turn around and look back and say wow they're all good deals ... we did really well in each one of them but for years later he's got eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nEight hundred thousand sitting there let's do some math let me get off the trustee phone here let's do some math just\nTo show you what I mean Iraq he's making four thousand a month for a thousand times twelve making forty thousand you're divided by eight hundred thousand dollars of equity\nHe's making six percent return you see what I mean\nNow what did he invested in those houses he probably invested less than twenty five thousand house let's say twenty grand house\nTimes nine will come up with that number just sort of the difference what he thinks he's earning or what most people think they're earning twenty thousand times nine\nIs a hundred and eighty thousand dollars now take the the um four thousand times twelve forty eight thousand a year divided by a hundred and eighty thousand and he thinks he's making\nTwenty six point six percent return the numbers he's calculated and and the numbers he shared with us was that kind of return in their twenties high twenty returns\nHe thinks he's making twenty six percent return but in reality he's making six percent return on his family's network his network in those houses an eight hundred thousand bucks\nHe thinks it's a hundred and eighty 'cause he's not counting all of the dead equity it's just like it's not even there just like your painful home that money's not even\nThere it's just kind of thinking guys keep or what I Want you to do\nOf all I Want you to figure out if you want to make any money become rich and retire early that's the first step but if you do then what do we need to do then we need to get on top of where your money's going to come from to invest\nOr do we have enough to work to start with without doing anything you just got money laying around we'll do that that if not where's the next easiest place to get the money that cost is the least to go get the money\nAnd we'll take a look at those options maybe it's borrow from your four one K. maybe it's liquidate four one K. maybe it's a liquid that your IRA maybe it's refinance and cash out refinance your house\nYou got rental properties maybe refinance and political without a maybe it's time to sell them and move on to something larger like an apartment complex\nThose are the kinds of decisions we have to make about your financial position before you even start making a move because if you start small and collect pebbles you're going to end up with a bucket full of pedals and you're never going to own a rock\nAre making a move because if you start small they collect pebbles you're going to end up with a bucket full petals and you're never going to own a rock\nIf you want to order raw you got to figure out how to go buy a rock that raw may mean you have to trade in all your bubbles remember monopoly board greenhouses and they turned it over to a
