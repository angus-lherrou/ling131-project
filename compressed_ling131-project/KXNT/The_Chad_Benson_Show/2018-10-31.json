[noise]\nI Love your back you know here's some more money you can just send you a man on a mission to retire one version and there's one that I was a\nRadio show or if you're sitting out there in a highly compensated skeptical individual that believes that everything you've been taught and your life\nHas worked out great for you so you should continue to believe the rest of the knowledge which is the basic foundation for your financial plans for retirement and then wake up late in life and figure out it's not working then this is the show you should be listening to\nGot Gregor and that's the beauty egg here and they are from uh the Dallas area and what they've done is they've\nGone out believe it or not in three years and bought forty six apartment complexes\nUh invested in them that are currently are instilled thirty eight of those arrested soul uh they've got three thousand seven hundred and twenty nine units and if you got even one red house and they said he got three thousand seven it come on guys\nThis is this is a this is exciting stuff as we're going to break that we're talking about being skeptical about coming to the free workshop even as they drove to the two day there were skeptical about the two days we're going to pick this backup that then you got cut off the air and to say okay this skepticism was there\nBut let's talk about what the first day brought to you\nAnd then we'll get to the second day later so talk to us about the news about how you took that skepticism into the first day and what you came away with after one day\nWell first you know not all of that angle camera work and I'm David Greene talking I'm thinking to replace\nYeah by the end of the second day that either or the end of the first day of it either going to be multi family\nLeast it wasn't going to solve all of our prop it might make it better but not alpha\nSo what was the moment I don't know which one do we want to pick this up or maybe both of you should highlight it because it could be different I always like to ask you sitting there listening to the second day and boom the live ball goes off because in in your resume who you talk about\nUm you know you decided right then and there on that second day that you were going to go ahead and upgrade and go out there and get started what was the light bulb went off Bethany that said boom now I get it\nWell my wife and why\nAnd how apartments are valued and therefore it here and I'm like a that\nEvaluation gotta stop and I literally was sitting there with me than I had been kind of thing and figure it out okay so what about uh two million dollar apartment complex and we had five hundred thousand dollar as it did it end up valuable that five hundred thousand dollar\nA federal money and I was like on that [laughter] I think this can be done\nNow did you share that with Gregory Gregory did you ever did for the second day\n[laughter] I Know that I was saying that if any I that that really caught my eye and I guess the other part is uh how much passive income over and at worst sort of a different way of looking at things and I've never\nBeen exposed to that and that's really changed how we approach things especially since after we've joined lifestyle\nYeah that little calculation and I came up with a Twenty years ago has probably changed more people's minds about their finances than anything else\nWhere you take all of your passive income from last year and divided by your network the average person makes less than one percent on their net worth per year so it's a frightening realization or for us that are highly invested by the way\nWe would be considered incredibly good if we capital ten percent return on our network but we fighting somewhere between one in ten percent is that fight to keep everything you have reinvest it did not let your equities grow in your house and not let you record is growing your documents\nOr et cetera et cetera et cetera and to keep that up moving so that's a great epiphany so you guys came out of their decided upgrade um let's talk about then\nThe next step how much education did you pick up on because you guys are highly educated people we have massive education how much of the education did you use before you went out and bought some\nAll of that we literally got home from our a first mentor a point where we had ... term at the time\nAnd he gave me a whole thing and a whole paycheck videos that Gregory and I had to do or we talk to him again and literally on the way home we stopped at the store and buy happiness\nAnd immediately started reading and watching everything here we both watched all of them\n\nThat's interesting because I'm I'm In the process of buying a class C apartment complex right now my fiance he's been in the business for twenty twenty five years as a manager in as a supervisor you know what I made us both do right before we while we are in the process by using went back and took the whole multifamily series again\nThere's just not enough education out there you forget things it sharpens is saw you ready to go get attack and so and so forth and let's talk about road trips did you go on any of them case\nThe saw you're ready to go attack and so and so forth and let's talk about road trips did you go on any of them case studies did you see them let's hear about your thoughts of knows\nWhat kind of should probably talk about ... I was used for you know it ... you get a fatty\n... be\n... I went on several case studies before a totally mention and get a Tibetan a and getting her to do to the free workshop just staying family after a family where single family as as change their their lives and the retirement pattern\nAs well as you know multi family a\nAnd a case study them sharing you know than the numbers and such and you know saying\nDeal after deals that had been positive ah\nAnd then once we we join lifestyles and became preferred members uh we've been to every Dallas road trip uh\nUnless we were on vacation or such we've probably been to eighty plus more I also I've been down to San Antonio central Texas road trip\nTo three times now on a\nShortly after we joined went down there and we haven't been in about six deals out of out of San Antonio and you know that's a good past us down there and we we tried da da da da\nDa da and road trips a very very useful you gain knowledge is well it's also a networking time with\nA you know everybody involved with lifestyle\nWill get back to that network he aspect and second Greg Rob I Want to ask you this uh Bethany as a a financial I counted I guess you are I don't know proceed during up at accounting and Greg or as a business owner can you imagine\nSomeone come up to you and say Gregory like I'm thinking about becoming a you know that can you show me how to run one of these things and and\nBethany can you show me your financial statements let me look at them and see your payroll and your expenses and your insurance could you give me all it inside reformation or\nAnd all that is fair game and and within lifestyles and ... actually encourage a young people helped me out when I first started and now I'm you know passing it back and help and you know all the people that think there are\nVery similar to Tibet study and I and a year now where\nYou lied to help you know all those lifestyle members it that we can\nAs members from looking inside out and remembering back when you were looking outside in what do you think creates the abundance mentality that the members of lifestyles have that there's enough for all of us where do you think that comes from\n\nBoth parties have never exactly what you found and they're always deal selling their always African unity kicked off if they got one here lifestyle call so there's no need for me to mark how are you from ... ... it may end up helping me again later\nGotcha\nSo let's talk now much changes topic oh go ahead Greg it's more to go ahead\nWell I think it it goes along well with the case studies you know you're not a member you come in and you see these families up talking numbers in and you know spilling their God they're they're doing it just you know because they're grateful that they were able to make this money on this deal\nUm and I think it's just it sets the tone I'm\nA you know that's sort of what we do here and and you know and what's expected and\nUh I I just I just you know that\nI don't know how you say it you know I guess that's what I expected as a little harsh but uh it's just a friendly caring type atmosphere\nLet's go down a different route now and let's talk about you brought it up earlier Gregory Gregory um that about networking massive mess\nYeah and let's talk about you brought it up earlier Gregory Gregory um that about networking massive massive massive opportunities to network both in road trips case studies the advance the expo everywhere and that led to you\nInvesting with thirty three different lead investors can you sort of parse it out for us how did you get to thirty three different people\n\nI'm a big being an aggy or that sort of sticks out a day their love you hate you but ah\nYou know like you know meeting people and you know they're all all open and uh I don't know better than it helped me out here how do we make thirty three just being act\nWell I mean well being active is absolutely wrong I think you know it goes back to I in a way almost it's like a part time job and part of my age will now if they get to meet people\nAnd that's one of the things that you do to try and decide if you want to and that's you know how much do you like how much she liked what they're saying are they educate it's like you are um\nWhat is it that you need to do you know Gregor went to San Antonio I'm and profit cart you know we emailed them we ask questions than uh we got their resume you know the whole time or kind of looking at this age who do we like who is the deal that would like to get into what we're looking for\n\nBut so many hard time job is also centered around food and an entertainment so it's not a I Do want to do it so to speak is not a [laughter] ... or even an eight to twelve\nYour carry on even they are denied [laughter]\nSo you guys of the I think you guys about probably answered my question all the way I've been to answer for the audience I always ask people do you believe more in the horse or do you believe more in the jockey meaning you worry more about the deal do worry more about the person leading the DEA which would you guys believe in most\nWhat what are you what is more important to you the horse's jockey\nWhere's where's black driver I think it's more about horse that Jackie and you know the lead and I were the numbers person\nI'm the one that's sitting there trying to make sure that I can make the numbers for just the way they said they were\nAbout what kind of split\nThat's interesting I've never you know and put\nThat way that's a great combination really guys\nYeah well it it's the the reason I go for the for the the jockey is\nWhen I when our youngest in high school gets into college you want to do travelling and so the more jockeys I haven't more races that means the more wins all get\nSo uh I go with a lot of jockeys because\nCome two years when they're on their second third fourth second third day of wood wherever they'll come back to me first for adults hikes in their first round because they'll remember we were there when they were trying to raise raise money and you know no one no one knew their names so to speak\nBrings us to another topic you guys have specialized in investing with first time leads a twenty five first time leads out of forty six deals that's quite a resume of taking on the new investor tell us your thoughts behind that and let's keep that down to\nWhy resume or taking on the new investor tell us your boss behind that and let's keep that down to one and a half minutes before we got to go to break to go ahead\nOh one minute my early ... that we're going to get we're going to messes up this was a really important topic I don't want to mess was went up so I'm going to hold you up with what I'm asking you got to bring this back when we come back is your theory behind why'd you go with Bruce dive leads there's really a lot of reasons\nPros and cons to go one way or the other so I Want to discuss this this is not a to second topics over the whole so I'm going to go to break you want to call and ask questions or number's eight seven seven seven eleven fifty do all of them be right back with Greg or that sort of you to do on the
