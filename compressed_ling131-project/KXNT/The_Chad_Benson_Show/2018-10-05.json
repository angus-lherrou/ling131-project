here about this with the people get to know who you are since a really first introduction as it is a national mentor let's talk about you as a young kid ... what we like growing up and did you have any idea you were going to be entrepreneurial when you were growing up\nOh man I was not expecting this um\nAs a young kid I'll be honest I had a\nI had no clue what I was going to do I think many times I was fortunate enough just to uh just I feel like I was making it and uh this this is you kind of caught me because this is something that um\nOthers to you based on your list in the news and information you rely on even when you are near\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomething in easier way a better way of of just replacing my income of if I were going to retire\nYou know how am I going to replace that income that I'm not going to be making you know in high tech you know you're lucky to make it by fifty you know I'm\nFifty five sixty is is almost you know out of the questions\nAnd so um it's not that I felt like my time was limited but I felt like I needed to figure this thing out whatever retirement what's going to be and how I was going to make that happen and start early and then start early is what we always talk about with with what we're taught is that you know working save them and we did that and we work than we saved quite a bit\nYou know with with what we were bringing in and um\nYou know it was I think always something out there that I just couldn't put my hands on and it wasn't until you know really twenty Thirteen um\nThat I that I discovered lifestyles on them and and that was only only because of a friend of mine you know when we were walking in and having to quit coffee break you know down the hallway we were talking about you know a real estate investments and things of that nature and he kind of turned me onto it but um you know\nBefore then it was the same thing that everybody else does you know it was the four one K. was areas of the stocks that was the mutual funds that was the goal in handcuffs and if you're in corporate America out there you know exactly what I'm Talking about you know they latch on to you and fought the goal in handcuffs and when you called stock options and man that ... that can keep you for four more years because they give you\nKnow so many shares that will will maybe best to maybe you know be above water\nBut um you know at the end of it I was I was making really good money I had a really good we had a really good life I mean we were making six figures easy you know and uh what we thought was pseudo job security you know without really knowing what was going to happen or when it was going to happen in terms of like ... but um\nBut it wasn't until twenty Thirteen that we found a lot of style and decided to make that jump\nTo talk about the transition because you know you've got to get the good job working [noise] you know did you hear about this what was it that that type ... you would somewhat exploited you had to just must be your friend or work or whatever or what was it didn't tells you about this long process\nI mean I think I ... yeah um I I think I realized pretty quick it was\nEverything that I had been looking for you know the whole idea of real estate and I've I've read if people you know a millionaire next door then millionaire um there was another one out there but um I I've read those books and stuff and knew that real estate was was something that that I thought made sense I just didn't have the means to knowledge or the education to figure out how to do it\nWithout putting everything that we had saved at risk and so there was hesitation and the skepticism and\nAnd it was you know be talking about these five twenty nine plans for kids you know college savings and and and and their teacher education then you know my buddy was you know Carlos was telling me about you know investing in in a\nSingle family you know properties than he has three kids as well we had a lot in common he bought three of them\nAnd his idea was I bought a house for each kid\nAnd when they're ready to go to college we're just going to sell the house to take all the equity out and boom there's or college tuition I thought I had the most incredible thing I've ever heard how the heck did you figure out how to do this and you mentioned you mentioned lifestyle you know and um\nYou know we got into it you know through through that way you know through Helmand that that little five minute session\nYou know to give you as you see here is complicated you are right now that that simple concept at all the one or not but we're getting so many of our members want to be completely retired so many of them want to be millionaires he just wanted a way to fund this kid's college that's amazing bond that is\nSo many of them want to be millionaires he just wanted a way to fund this kid's college that's an amazing thought that it can be as simple as that yet empowering and you thought that was amazing\nAnd now with what you know from what all you've done you can realize that that was a very tiny step compared to what he could have done so it's interesting to hear the story\nFrom that perspective so how did you come to lifestyles originally did you go to a free workshop to bring you to a case study how'd you how'd you get over here\nYeah his his memberships or was he he's he's been with us for quite some time two thousand nine but he's only bought those few homes and I didn't know about the case studies or anything like that are really anything beyond that Arthur helping a lot to do my research and found a free workshop and that was my\nThat was you know my my end into lifestyles that kind of you know see what this was about and and whether or not we bought it made sense and we went through that a free workshop and that progressed into you know the two day\nAnd um I told my wife I said look at the ...\nI think it was five hundred bucks or something like that at the time and I said look it's going to be the best five hundred bucks we we've ever spent because this was going to completely change our lives or it's not but it it it's five hundred bucks you know and so um\nWe made that small jumps and what it is I mean it was a I mean for for my buddies is by three single family homes for him that was pretty big you know for me it's a five minute conversation which has the potential completely change in my life and did\nA dentist is next you know small little stuff that I had to take to make a five hundred dollar best not just to figure out the nuts and bolts of this thing of what it's about and you know and understanding a lot more if that's what I thought was going to be single family and you know real estate I only had no concept of multi family or apartments or anything of that nature\nBut it was just the course of these small steps that that we talk and these small decisions that we made and\nThat that really honestly got us to where we are now you know\nWell you know when you look at this thing you look back\nYou'd probably sit there and go like it happened so quickly I don't even know how it happened I the older I get the faster time flies by and these dates are thrown at me or not that far behind you they're not that long ago and I do the manual work three or four apartment complexes now how many on right now\nWe own well I mean we're uh we're owners than sixteen bills more than three thousand units we we own or manage two of them currently ourselves we have our own property management company and and we own owner manage two of those\nAnd as the income goes up there's more to live on but I don't live on it because I'm already ... life's quality wise so mortgage investors and so the growth curve he just gets more like a hockey stick ... faster and faster so I think that's something that\nI've never been really good at getting across to people you most people think hey I stopped working man now I gotta die before I run out of money is not even close to true and I can see what you you grow your portfolio continue to grow your portfolio\nFinances are probably not even on the table for you anymore you're probably that point that many deals that much either you under your belt that you just don't even worry about um\nThe other one is is that\nRetirement is not the end but it's really the beginning you think about what you were able to do right now Kevin with all the time you have to think about a new business to create a new business to go with your family do stuff\nLet's compare time wise because now before even if you want to do something and you were the brilliant engineer you couldn't do it you had to get up and go to work now something hits you in the middle of the night you get up tomorrow morning and you attack at like a dog\nTalk about the time difference in being your own man\nI yet again it's it's a it's a night and day difference and that that that really is what it's about I mean and in corporate America America you're you're trading all your time\nOr for what seems like good money and and and that's what it is and you know I Would\nI'd be out the door before my girls even woke up before I could get them you know before they even ate breakfast you know and it's a work just to avoid the morning traffic you know the main catch him to catch a seven AM call you know work my twelve fourteen sixteen hour days go back home you know most times you know not even be able to to get some you know before they go back to\nWork my twelve fourteen sixteen hour days go back home you know most times you know not even be able to to get some you know before they go back to bed before I'm coming back into the door I'm you know catching dinner or not you know sometimes in some cases only to hop on another phone call at seven PM and\nAnd and that's the circle is is this just vicious corporate circle that just turns in grinds and\nAnd um it's it can be um\nI I don't know people do people get used to that and uh\nIt's a it's a time vampire I mean I spent a lotta time traveling overseas traveling the world and when I was younger that was great got to see the world that see a lot of things but you know with my kids and everything I Want it to be home I wanted to\nSpend the weekends with them instead of being stuck in an airport you know I wanted to be able to wake up in the morning\nAnd in and make the decision whether or not to go to work you know do I have to go to that meeting is that really important can I put it off is Margot I Need to do it now you know and I can do all that now you know I'll give you a quick example we were we were going somewhere I I forgot what we're go we're going out of town on a weekday\nAnd uh we're stuck on the freeway it's probably eight o'clock nine o'clock in the morning something like that\nAnd one of my girls goes who are all these people when we're talking about who are all these all these people all these cars what what's going on we're stuck in traffic\nThis is morning traffic and they had no concept of morning traffic you know what I mean because they had never done that with me before\nYou know like these people are going to work this is what people do this is what most people just to this is not what daddy does your daddy leave\nHe goes to the properties that today a when all that God and he comes back before that traffic it's against the they they didn't know the concept of of morning traffic you know because they've they've never been exposed to it so\nYou know stuff like that I mean in in terms of time it's it's been it's been a big change is that an an amazing change for us in in one that I just really anticipate happening you know just from a retirement perspective you know my my plane\nWas fifty five that's when I was going to retire but I had my spreadsheets engineer spreadsheets number is all that stuff calculated I beat my playing by fourteen years because of lifestyle\nWhile seniors I retired when I was forty one you got me be right thirty four [laughter] but I I was able to get out of their forty one you know personal choice no layoff no separate me writing letters my manager was saying you know what guys\nI'm going home [laughter] you know what I mean and that's what it was it was making that decision uh hey I don't need this job\nI don't need the job I don't need this any more I have the passive income I had my first deal is the lead investor you know we had a plan in front of us I sat down with my mentors at the time you know multiple times to say I am I crazy you know I I'm seriously thinking about doing this job a very very comfortable W to\nInsurance the whole thing too I'm just gonna throw it all the wage job because I Believe in the system because of the system in the last two years has done more for me than the hockey team\nAnd that's how significant that was for us and we made the jump I mean Lara retired shortly after we joined\nShe retired and leaves twenty Thirteen and then the plan was for me to get out\nAnd um I made that happen in June of swing sixteen shortly after closing our first still but it was because of that passive income that got us to that opportunity that created that opportunity for us to make that kind of decision and that's a that's a big decision that was a very big decision but it's been\nIt's it's like you said it's it's a fun really started after I retired you know what I mean I made more money after retiring than I ever did in the Eighteen years I was I was at that company\nThat's a really scary part is is to look back and go like I ...\nDid I ever did in the Eighteen years I was I was at that company\nYeah that's a really scary part is is that if you look back like I thought I was getting somewhere but heck I Will to scratch and service on the opportunity for making money that's that's a crazy part did you start out as a pastor Brazil lead on your first deal\nOr a ... ... ... ... ... that that into right I mean that that that was the goal is that we had that dollar amount per month and in terms of expenditures that we were trying to replace them through\nWe jumped in the multi family you know what to do to you always talk about going in the mud and then we took that to heart it's like well we're in a place the savings\nThat we've been you know hoarding up I thought that we can go with the end of mud we know we need vehicle that's where we need to go to Joe and so we started or what we\nWere going to have to jump out of this segment and
