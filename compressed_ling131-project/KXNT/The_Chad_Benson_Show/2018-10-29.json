are we going to do to take our lives from the ordinary and make them into the extraordinary\nIt's it's just one of those things that we have to ask ourselves every day and this interview tonight that you were going to hear with Jeannie lady is going to let you step into the world of the infinite\nAnd the eternal a blessings and joy and happiness and so if you stay tuned or we're going to focus on that and I just just a Tony I think I sent you that information so you might double check then see if it shows up over there\nSo so without further ado I Want to go ahead and talk to you about the young lady that I have on the phone or ...\nAre you there is any can you hear me now\nI can can you hear me just say can't what an amazing thing I I'm Still amazed as a clarity you know here you are because you're up in a in Alaska aren't you\nI Am and at the snowstorm [laughter] you're kidding it's there's no sir right now\nYeah I I think that the universe decided that were skipping Halloween and Thanksgiving and going straight to Christmas\n[laughter] yes I think that's one of the things I liked about you I mean you're not complaining about it you see what I mean that's a that's going to tie into this whole interview here tonight you know you know it's funny I mean I've known you now for I've got to be about five years maybe a bit more um and at one of the things I've enjoyed about you is\nA you maintain a very positive uh\nInspirational attitude and then I got a chance to see you get tested on that right so then we got it it got her homework assignment on that one and then\nWe all do sometimes in different sorts of ways I I Do too and all sorts of different ways um so anyway what I Want to just say to you or everybody out there is that a\n... I don't know exactly how long how long is you maybe you want to tell a story I was just introduced it by saying Jeannie was diagnosed with stage four\nMetastasized to bring up not bring a breast cancer right is it that because that's the right way to put it OK yeah and I 'cause I remember you telling the whole story and including the fact worse I think I'm gonna let you explain how you first found out about it\nAnd because I always saw Jeannie around she's incredible singer you're gonna hear some overseeing here tonight she's got an incredible book coming out\nAnd so I Would just are is just kind of light hearted so Alaskan person you know from the uh the has the outback or something not not exactly right but you know ... actually but you get the general idea and and then you suddenly had this experience\nAnd I got to see exactly how you handled it from day one 'til right now and that's been a that's been a very very very inspiring experience for me and I know many other people to to tell us just for a second what happened what your story as\nWell though I Will start with a last year in November\nAnd what happened what your story as\nWell so uh I Will start with a last year in November I was singing and speaking at Craig does waltz rocket life night down in Anaheim, California shelling absolutely great um you know carrying my heavy equipment around the country doing\nYou know concerts and and uh uh had this this beautiful evening I'm at a great venue and with even dance along with the band singing my you know new religious beliefs of the\nThe theme song for that night rock your life and the next night I woke up at two AM and I could barely walk um [noise] I had so much pain radiating down like right leg with\nI describe it like if you if you had to hanging from your hip and you're in the dentist chair getting drill on with no no became that put it felt like it doesn't sound like much ... and now now so\nI I canceled a my other obligations and came home to Alaska and on December first had an MRI\nSo when I'm already noticing though I'm listening very carefully she's reading the story\nIs this an instruction for all of us and NATO but it was not an indictment or criticism of anybody out there this is not the purpose of this show is only in an instructional opportunity for each one of us\nHer response is somehow were uniquely positive whereas our human normal human reaction might have been to fall into some darkness and by the way if that happens in one of our lives is okay the only point is don't get stuck there but anyways so junior you're back with us now than\nI Am All right so does that sound like you're ... ... what you are starting to say to us yeah [laughter]\nSo okay so you're you're told you have an incurable condition and yet you say your husband somehow ... and like you said you you give a lot of acknowledgement that God don't you on this whole thing\nWell absolutely and you know one way when we went to the break a for commercial um you know what we're talking about is is really the and um and and that to me um and to my husband you know we just felt like this\nWas a blessing it was a gift\nUm that would allow me to reach more people um you know give me an opportunity to kind of dig deeper and really hone in on line message and again you know what if what better way to sort of prove the um [noise]\nValidity of the the eight daily habits in my leap of faith but that I live by because truly those habits I Believe are a big part of my miracle you know on\nDecember first two thousand Seventeen was the diagnosis stage four minutes static breast cancer on April twenty seven\nThousand Eighteen just five months later I had a PET scan and there was not one single a cancer cell that let up on that PET scan though you know I talk about um\nThat's amazing I gotta I have to have to stop you again just to keep stopping this because I Am because of because I I actually was with you or not long after you're diagnosed and or in March yeah certainly in March if nothing else that's right it probably was march\nAnd yeah um I just remember you sent me a very positive attitude and we had you know of course everybody wanted to connect with you which makes complete sense and a ... but the thing that it's amazing is that\nYou responded in such a place of light\nOr that somehow ... in a miraculous weight I mean we we can't really say anything less than a miraculous camera I mean that could be so serious and be gone and April twenty seven I mean you tell me about that yeah\nWell okay so so I'm going to just go through these eight habits in a very quick way number one act is is that we act as if I was perfectly healthy and that you know yeah I have a little bit of a bump in the road but I was going to be fine\nA number two um you know a dream big\nYou know continue to dream about the way that uh I can use my message to ... you know to really um fill other people with hope and healing on their journey\nCan use my message to ... you know\nTo really um feel other people with hope and healing on their journey a number three big in it now you know I'm One give it to said whatever you can do or dream you can begin it old and this has genius power and magic and it begins now but I just began\nDoing all kinds of you know praying and meditating and a chick on exercise and changed my diet and you know ah it took out alcohol and just just did a whole bunch of different things that um you know and I and I just began it right away\nUm use your imagination um gosh that's you know I don't even need to really expound on that\nAre living gratitude you know I just every moment of every day I just you know was grateful for whatever blessings this would bring in whatever opportunities that it might open up for me to just share you know a new and deeper message\nA let the music lift you certainly rode a lotta new songs and started creating my new book a habit number seven um laugh while you're crying [laughter] and you know a surprisingly I only cry twice this the whole time and it was at the very beginning\nOnce was on the phone call in my car when the doctor initially said what he said and I was like dang and then the second time was I you know a couple of weeks into it I wanted to cook dinner and I was just shooting tired I literally couldn't\nCook dinner if you paid me and I love I Love cooking for my boys you know my husband and my son and it just bummed me out so much that I couldn't make dinner that I cry but other than that um you know that's really that was really the extent of of the tears and and then number eight\nUm leap with love and so I just did everything from a place of love and you know obviously that starts with God and a lot of deep conversations with Jesus and\nYou know remembering my angels and um and just you know put those habits to use every day and uh you know and just do it believed you know believed in America I I open my new book with\nUm the key to being blessed begins with the leading that you are the key to sing miracle begins with believing that you will and the ... to ... hope begins with the leading in the brightness of your light\n... it was beautiful it was really really beautiful you know I I remember you're right I I interview in the show before you were had his diagnosis and so you know and I remember zooming before during and feeling right now\nYou are very nice kind of warm loving energy the kind of projects\nIn when you're saying is that way too you know in in fact you know ... is your is your ... which if we want to put a little clip from people's of people could hear a little bit of you're seeing\n... open a couple of records were quick would you recommend or not\nI Would start with the radiating hope because that's the title song for the new book an album\nTo be I'm going to just put the song for ... ... people put on the whole clip but them and put it on right now or Tony and let's just to relax and everybody can listen on Facebook to be sued pumping out over Facebook so are you going to do it on for a minute ... was who doesn't like [noise]\n\nAll right so that's that's beautiful you know I just it's very I remember this before no did you write the song after before you were diagnosed\nI couldn't hear what you played so with a bow and go oh you can hear the most interesting oh it was written any hope\nYeah so I wrote that uh as I was going through you know January February march or going through treatment and I'm like radiologists [noise]\nUm actually his color radiation oncologist wary Dorothy\nOr has this a foundation called ... and what they do is they actually\nHave climbers who bring prayer flags to the top of mount Kilimanjaro Everest as a way to raise funding for countries that are less fortunate that don't have rape radiation equipment\nAnd uh and when I received my prayer flags after my radiation treatments or my brother in law did McKown decided that he wanted to come by flagged for me\nAnd so in the process of all this stuff that was happening I mean that's a whole other story in itself but\nUh that song was it came to life and so um it is the title funk or the ... minute well in in my books if you remember Robert I and each chapter with a song that goes with that you know the message out after and so\nSo a chapter number two is called radiate hope and now the song is ready to cope and it I just came back from San Antonio Texas where I was invited down to the radiating hope\nAny it might be seen as you may be a little bit crazy too I just decided I had that in ... he was just so maybe that's what we need in this life a little bit of craziness maybe that's what we need a right but but but he was your your line on your side laughing with a lot of people by saying I'm going to die but [laughter] but so then what happened\nWell thankfully this guy named John Paul um who was the repeal of the high school building had a crush on me and I'd only been in the village I think for a week at that at that point but he had a crush on me and so when he realized that I you know I wasn't at the high school I wasn't at the elementary school\nI wasn't at the house that I was staying in where was I and so he actually came out looking for me and a and found me and he actually tried to get my style machine started to but it was just flooded from flipping over and and so he just ended up driving me back to my housing and then we went back the next day and got got the snow machine but it was\nWhat I think you know what I'm thinking to myself when I hear your stories kind of like the cancer\nA lot of people getting in line they're saying oh my God I don't nobody nobody's going to ever find me a I Can't don't even know which way to go and I'm going to die I mean that would have been a normal reaction and somehow you're laughing and this guy shows up and just kind of comes and rescues you\nAre right in ... in ... you're right it's a good thing at a romantic crush on you maybe would have done anyone who knows but um but that's no but I mean there's something in your attitude that we could all learn to model and they will maybe we do need to laugh a little bit more\nAnd laugh our way through life I think that that's a good lesson on this because us exactly how you respond\nArnold and they will maybe we do need to laugh a little bit more and laugh our way through life I I think that that's a good lesson on this because that's exactly how you responded to being diagnosed with cancer\nYeah so so what what advice do you have the right right this second there's people listening I guarantee it uh\nThat maybe some people may be discouraged some people may not even be sure they really want to live I mean is it as a doctor today and he was telling me\nHe gets patients like that sometimes you know in their ... their cut off from family and they're either family doesn't live in town and um it is I don't even know why they want to live and so ... yeah what's your encouragement for people in situations well or maybe you're facing a difficult health condition\nYeah yeah when you ask for a while my advice would be the\nVery first thing I Would say is\nLive in the present moment because we get you know a part of the problem with fear is you know you're getting a diagnosis and you say oh crap you know if only they would have seen this in my mammograms that I've had every single year than this wouldn't happen or\n... or you go to the future and you think oh my God I'm not going to see my son you know get married\nAnd by the way I got to see somebody I I remember you talk to me about that when you first diagnosed as you said gosh you know I remember being in this life where I was just like everybody else and suddenly it's like I may not be able to continue on or something like that I don't remember how you put it\nStill you know finding a way to just within the present moment because it\nSeriously if you live in the present and then you find gratitude you know there's there's a way to find gratitude regardless of how dire your situation is you know it could be something as simple as look out the window and if it's a sunny day and the trees are green in the sky is blue\nYou know that's kind of ... look at it and be grateful for it and\nKnow I guarantee that every single time you find something to be grateful about more gratitude come your way\nWas that and that's a better way that's an ancient fruits well you're talking about I Know you know that\nAnd a half but it's a good thing for all of us to think about everyone out there listening right now would soon as we get fixated on Syria negativity\nAnd the ... and by the way the right now the media is set up so that it's it's ... ... fans of those flames of fear\nAnd it causes people to come very anxious and and frustrated and in so somehow you're saying don't buy into that stay in love and the and grace ... good way to put it\nYeah and then the other thing is you know my favorite thing is is a expect blessings and we're close because again if you know if you believe\nThat you're going to see blessings\nYou know if you believe that you're going to experience miracle you will experience them and they may not always turn out exactly how you wished they would you know we don't always get what we want but\nYou know the thing is is that if you if you just give up\nYou're certainly not going to get what you want you know you have that attitude of of gratitude and those of you know expectation of the good there's always good to be found there is always good to be had it's how you measure it\nIs so beautiful and him and you know there's no God works for me to I was dealing with an issue's getting me a little bit down on Saturday\nAnd ah and we went into a open house near my office somebody who's selling your house and it was real nice lady came over to me and
