the journey everything we encounter as part of our life journey so then it becomes up the each of us to decide how we're going to utilize that journey how we're going to grow in that journey\nSo tonight I invite you to join with me and just open yourself to a new possibilities in life open yourself to the miraculous potential of life the miraculous possibilities of life and this is not really the purpose of life is to see what can we what can we learn about life\nWhat can we make happen in his life what is the opportunity of his life when I before I come to this show a sin quite a bit of time in prayer and I was driving over here saying the odd what can we do\nIn this show to make a difference for you the listener and in tone at and then Ernie and I say a prayer together as well I say a prayer to a inspiring uplift to people they're listening river and Ernie who's also here with me here tonight and Gen and she'll be here as well so the purpose of this show\nIs to create a possibility for life that we may not have seen up till now\nThe possibility of living life in a more loving Julius happier way than ever before\nTo have a feeling of meaning and fused with meaning and joy and love and your life isn't that how we want to live really\nYou know you can have the greatest set of toys and structures around you\nBut if you don't have love you're still not going to be happy\nAnd it's interesting I talked to my kids about this all the time yes prosperity is a good thing we all need prosperity is if you're under too much stress about you know how you got to pay your bills that's not good either leads to stress on happiness\nSo we we ... that's not good either but but the other side of it is\nYou'll meet people all the time that have plenty materially but they don't know love they don't know loving their heart in there so they don't know the assurance of God's Grace in love\nThey don't feel a sense of of meaning or purpose in life\nThey think life is just something to ah just a distraction as meaningless and when you have those kind of feelings life is not a happy experience\nAnd so the purpose of this show is it to share with you a different possibility\nSee that there is truly a meaning to your life and my life and there is truly an infinite presence of God that is with us and in six to lift us up\nAnd that's my imitation is your view tonight to be open to that possibility you open to the healing transforming possibility that we can create inexperienced by sharing the son together\nIt was really we are sharing this time and I was the teacher who are deemed me as a minister a woman many years ago I used to say we meet by divine appointment so for those of you listening right now this is our ... or on the radio or even on Facebook does or divine appointment to meet this is our divine appointment\nTo meet so tonight my friends\nI only ask you one thing would you be willing\nTo find greater happiness joined peace than you've ever yet no\nWould you be willing to set aside the suffering the struggles of your past and encounter a new kind of joy peace and love in your life\nWould you be willing to like God right upon your soul in a new way\nOf creating a new possibility of life\nIs not really what it's all about for those of us and the spiritual journey\nLetting ourselves evolved to a new possibility so tonight right now\nMy my prayer for each one of us is that we joined together\nAnd open ourselves to the miracle working power of God\nWho we joined together and open ourselves to that\nThe topic tonight is learn how to to love and find love in this life learn how to learn how to love how can we learn how to be more loving and where where can we go with that experience what can what can we make of that in our life how can we learn to love and be more laughing and that's the whole topic tonight\nIs that I'm telling ya I've seen it in my life since the people\nAnd that's the show is really about [noise]\nAre you in a high living our lives the most effective way\n... are we living the most effective way in our city our nation or world\nYou know and and this show is here as much to provide healing\nFor is dry feeling for everyone listening\nAnd anybody was open to hearing [noise]\nAnd that you've healing here as I listen I just I I really been trying to tune out the news quite a bit lately but I you know obviously I picked up some of it in the last few days and I know there's been a lot of political energy flying around about certain things um [noise]\nAnd so we don't want to say one thing to you about all that um\nWe will not be happy\nIf we're spending all of our time reporting each other down\nIs simply not not a good formula for life\nAnd I think we all know that in our hearts and I and I think that\nAnd so this shows about saying hey you know what there's a better way to live\nAnd didn't have to be about constantly are making people wrong and attacking them and but in this applies to all traditions but either way you know a belief systems and all religious but I really did not talking about religious or political points of view but we we we need to be loving but I Want to invite each one of you recognize\nThere's a better possibility for all of us is a higher possibility or more joyous possibility\nAnd and let's let's not get sucked into that vortex\nWhen I was in law school I realized something\nI went to study for ... the bar exam\nIt was very easy to get sucked into fear and anxiety and that that kind of mob hysteria of all these different people studying for the bar on my God am I going to make it as is you know it it can pull you interfere that's what my thinking is all about or group thinking is all about\nAnd somehow I realized no you know what that's not working for me and said I removed myself from that group a and I stayed by myself when I prepare for the bar\nAnd I passed and as a matter of fact I took two other ... bars and pass them to using that same system so obviously it worked for me and the system is don't buy into the fears of the people around you so it's a night I Want to encourage you to take a higher higher road and\nThen what we're seeing in our media and our world around us take a road of love choose the path of love choose the path of compassion so what does it actually mean\nTo be to choose the path of love and how can you and I'd be more loving someone to just give you a few ideas how you and I can put that into effect and we're not we're on Facebook based on my right\nYeah forgive you are on I mean Facebook if you're on Facebook\nYou can go to Robert sat down and you can listen to me anywhere in the world right now as well as on the radio just tried to be in a a kicks in tea on radio dot com anywhere in the world to either way you can listen to live anywhere by the way the Facebook one will actually be\nAvailable later on by recording also but anyway so let's just give me some ideas of what what is love what does this thing we talk about what we hear about all the time almost every song is about about love but let me just start with some basics real basics\nIs learning to have compassion understanding for the people you're with [noise]\nI've been married thirty two years now and it's been very grateful I've learned so much about love in in my relationship to my wife\nAnd she taught me a lot about it and\nYou know for just raise an example my ... my wife loves\nA dogs and animals and so my relationship to embrace is how much that means to her\nAnd so and trying to live in a way that it accommodates whatever works for her in that area\nAnd without questioning and all the time and\nJust the beginning of stretching me into a person of now I'm I like animals too but [noise] but my point being is that learning to understand what another person [noise] makes another person checked or with the gives them a purpose and meaning for life that's sort of love really is about\nLearning to have compassion for where that person zapped so much of the time where we're spending\n... tend to be egocentric\nWhere where I'm always thinking\nWell why doesn't he or she she either way I Want to be treated why did she say the things that I don't want to hear why does he say why doesn't he say the things I I Need to hear doesn't understand me all that kind of thinking I get\nThat's normal that's human but what if you instead of worrying about what somebody saying to you started thinking about what you could say to the person what does your turned it around and and started asking how you could be more loving see that's that's foreign to our\nEgocentric nature all be human beings are born egocentric because that's how I Believe anyway whether we tend to look how things affect us and tend to not like things that we think are going to jeopardize us [noise] see that's by the way how it works in politics too\nIf we think something's going to jeopardize the world or life are values that we think are important we become fearful and then also angry at somebody who we think is doing the things we don't like\nAnd that's why you see such intense emotions\nThe deeper it goes into a person's basic core values than or what some people called reptilian survival self then the people get more emotionally upset otherwise it's just a more intellectual I don't agree with this or not but when it goes deep inside of you that's 'cause it's touching some deep values that you have that are attached year survival so\nIf you and I can learn to have more compassion for the survival issues that people have and communicate loved them right where they're at that is the beginning\nOf being a much much happier human being\nThat is the beginning of of really finding true love\nLet's not we're not working\nUp and say\nYou can go back if you want [noise]\nAnyway um\nI Try to adjust something on Facebook it looks like we may maybe having trouble and that but anyway but I really want to stress to you right now\nIs that\nI Want you to be willing to open your heart\nDefending a deeper love and you've ever known [noise]\nOpen up your heart to a deeper loving ... deeper peace than you've ever known\nAnd see if you can let that in ... in effect the people around you\nYou know that's what I Try to do every single day of my life and you know it really makes things much much happier I Am working a highly um Swiffer highly adversarial businesses an attorney\nYou know I Do you think of the gestures whose job is to give me as a little money as possible even with the clients who want as much money as possible new clients have been an accident so maybe emotionally upset because maybe they're\nThey're they're injured and on top of it they've lost their car and they don't know how to get to the work and maybe they're causing financial problems for them and all these different things can be going on in somebody's life\nIf I can learn to become passionate about that and try to meet those nice that people can turn into an opportunity to share love\nAnd peace and happiness\nSame thing like when I'm Talking to an ... an insurance adjuster if I recognize that insurance adjuster\nSelf or his stuff and they have been given a job and they may not always like it either you might find it frustrating stressful\nAnd as you can relate to that human beings and other human beings just trying to carry out a job and as as certain requirements they have to [noise]\nThat will begin to change your life\nIf you can begin to see love and the potential for love and\nEvery relationship that you have weather's five minutes\nOr years\nYou could have an experience love and telling you I'm positive that is true if you're willing to let your heart open to love you're willing to let your soul you open your loved and you know what my friends [noise]\nYou can come to know love and almost all experiences of your life\nLarge and small\nRashes the experience of walking into a store\nOr when I was down and I was down in San Diego into the uh\nUh Nevada try trailers are what we refer to as a matter of justice association and says it's run by a bunch of lawyers but\nWe're meeting a lot of different people plus I'm seeing a lot of lawyers\nIf you begin to\nThat each of these people it's like you\nOr they maybe they're fighting kind of a battle they're they're working to be as happy as they can successful as they can be a ... and they have different needs and different situation in ... after a while you get to know these people realize these are good people\nAnd you can begin to recognize that and people\nOr could be something as simple as you see\nA server in a restaurant\nAnd you acknowledge that person or in this case you know lift driver touch Willis driver yesterday you know one of the uh lifting Newberg the anyway I was with a lift driver my my son and I were there and sharing sharing with me\nHer secrets and how she makes it meaningful\nSee that's a very valuable experience in life very very valuable [noise]\nSo so for each of you out there\nAnd what you don't know what every or doing\nYou could share love you could bring love you can begin to make your life loving happy Joyce experience\nNow you're not always going to feel\nIt at every single second and somebody last week I had somebody call and really just not not one of my clients but one of the people that Hitler my clients just completely lied about how the accident happened and try to pretend it didn't happen in any way uh luckily we had some witnesses and we could prove our story but when I'm getting at is\nYou know I I could\nDecide to be judgemental or angry about that that this person is trying to lie and cover up the situation but is there what I'd rather do is say uses an opportunity to forgive\nIs this an opportunity to have compassion but still stand up for the rights of my clients", "show_name": "The Chad Benson Show", "year": "2018",
