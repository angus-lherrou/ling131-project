group\nOK okay wonderful\nAll right thank you sort of a pre she had to call the rest of you out there hey gotta stick you tell when you got to come in and learn what it is we do you have to be able to conceive and believe before you can achieve if you can't conceive and believe there is no way you\nCan believe I'm buying property right now\nAh and of course you can't compare a beginner with me don't even go there but I buy the property right now that if I close the deal is going to make me fifty thousand dollars a month of tax free income and allow nine hundred thousand dollars with a private deductions that I could ride off against my personal income now that's unbelievable\nRight and you think about it you might work your whole life never come up with that kind of income\nAnd I'm doing it in one deal now I just sold a department complex and so I've gotten sitting on all this money is all by this one and another one and another one and another one so I might buy you know eight more properties and make fifty grand each be making four hundred thousand dollars a month\nIs like a gold somebody like me my path and typically I run between five and eight properties what a carry to any one time\nSo you know that would be my goal your goal might be to have like super there he's got you know thirty units mixed up and do plus you've tried pledges of four Plex and so we break that down to see an average of three probably got about ten buildings\nAnd so he's at that point like I when I get to eat I Want to sell and go get something more expensive something bigger\nI don't want to have Fifteen twenty or thirty buildings I just or a ... apartment complexes put it that way so he's a direct point you know he's he's got ten buildings it's time to move up he can take all thirty those you just put it in one place to put a manager in there and he's done\nAnd then he can double the value that place within a year or two and doubles money where's the properties always right now he's not going to be a double their their value in a year or two they are what they are and they will go up by whatever appreciation allows them to go up so\nThat's just the way it is So Paul here we go we were back to you now and um we've got about two and a half minutes here\nLet's talk about this um how did you come to the conclusion that you wanted to retire this coming year\n\nWell [laughter] I'm I'm ah sixty six [noise] and ah I take away your previous sat interviewers are the wiring it just you know ...\n... you get hired you know even though I'm not positive thank you very positive mental attitude but it just started to get one yeah and I didn't want to be a a greeter\nAt Wal Mart itself\nI just started conflicts pay all that extra money I was getting out when I was filling up to like it by my own\nApartment show that that will put me over the top so what I'm making now what will I Will pay my bills ...\nResumes according according to what your resume says is you've already accumulated what will be if you retire about nine grand a month in income that's the theory safe amount of income to retire on but if people were more project in there you buy one more apartment yourself then that's going to kick that up over ten grand a month easily\nA and pretty much that's that's more than most people making the job Paul\nYes I'm very blessed I I Know I Can't believe that myself\nThat's the most people make it a job well\nYes I I'm very blessed I I ... you know I Can't believe it myself but it may not be a large amount to some people in the group there is a lot of ... year that year but to me\nThat if you let them six years ago I I look at you know or grand that's so cute so it it it'd be a sure\n...\nWell that's that's you know think about this guys out there how many people out there have NO PLAN how many people say hey I don't know what I'm going to do I don't have enough it's not going to work I can retire and it's a sad sad moment\nIf you want to call it
