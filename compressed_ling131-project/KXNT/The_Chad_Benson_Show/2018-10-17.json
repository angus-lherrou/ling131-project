most of the moon mission to remember the one version of what I'm saying ...\nThis is Len Merrill on that that do on the radio show where we are always working on your financial future and today Peggy and ... have joined me to share their story we talked a little bit about their family history and in childhood and it's really interesting because you guys came from really entrepreneurial backgrounds and\nLeo you had you know commercial real estate background and then you began to Journey Out and do all sorts of different things from there\nAnd ... you know we really look at some of the things that we we learned in childhood and and how it directs our lives how it it\nForms are thinking about things and yet Peggy you talked about um you know your family and just that strong entrepreneurial spirit and how you were heartbroken when they sold the business and you moved into corporate America which must have been an incredible shock and awe your\nYou know working and and dealing with the corporate structure that you never dealt with before and can you talk a little bit about about that you know you you touched on the pressure you touched on I'm having you know to find that that next deal when you were in sales\nAnd then what what happened as you moved out of sales\nWell what I did I I was really in a quandary trying to figure out what I wanted to do I just wasn't sure you know where I fit in with my my God given gift and so what I did I did several jobs on contract where I was able to go out to get for corporations\nAnd I'm In one day I just thought you know I'm doing this I'm not getting any benefit on working\nWell and I say I was just working forty hours but it was more as time went on but I thought you know if I'm going to be putting in forty hours a week then I probably need to hit land something and so I was at a bank and they offered me a job and I ended up staying there for Seventeen years and what was happening\nWell I was at a bank and they offered me a job and I ended up staying there for Seventeen years\nAnd what was happening to me like I Would maybe go in at eight o'clock in the morning and um I Would leave work about nine o'clock at night you know banks were really doing a lot of layoffs and you know if the other people's jobs Scott kept in you know they needed the people that were still there to handle the workload and\nI was fortunate to move up the ladder because of a person that I was reporting too\nAnd um and so I ended up I was like working for a bank president and so we had our regular line of business you know the\nBusiness that we were and we were in corporate banking that paid our salaries and then we had\nThe presidential duties and that was fun but it was a lot of hours will my boss left the bank which was stressful and I wanted to hang on because I wanted to stay there long enough\nTo have health insurance right [noise] so I scramble called all these departments around the bank that people that I've known that I got you know from being there for so long\nAnd then I landed a job in treasury where corporations would call in with issues and I was in\nCorporate customer service than we would help them you know solve their their issues in their problem and\nActually when I got there and they told me that my salary was going to be kept because I'd made more and my prior job and um and again that was long hours I was staying after to keep that and um you know I liked it I Love the clients but um once they passed a\nLike rule of sixty age was number of years of being there you could early retirement and so I asked to do that at that point\nOh yeah and that's you you get to that point where it's OK here I Am I I've worked all my life for this and now I'm just telling me that's it not going to make any more money and um and no no way really within their structure to earn it\nAnd Leo you and in sales and you've got a variety of different things that you were doing and how did how did you experience that with your career\nWell I'll tell you all and I'm\nStarting out you know some of the commercial real estate brokers it my situation was oh for ... for a second show about the YMCA that I ended up you know I just got for us but I don't like I've been on a date and\nAll like three years but it was that's how I got older the to vote one industry and doing that I Would always do it while what would happen is you end up they give you a territory and you build up your wind cells um\nAnd and and as time went on you would end up getting a tour you'd be making pretty good money and then they'd cut your territory that\nYou just go and they call you and and that's the study you get into a record\nOr phone or your sales you're going to end up getting you know we're going to give you tune in an accord and it's just you couldn't say I'd say you know that wants to marry built this up I've met all my clothes\nAnd you're going to do this to me and I just say that's the way it's going to be in because that's the word came down from ... headquarters and I'll just I'll tell you what my blood pressure just go right through the roof um and it was time went on the other part of it and we got older and older a lot of time you have going on at two o'clock in the morning\nGo do grocery store reset um on ones and\nUm you're doing it for a lot of other people in the next thing you know that is doing inventories on once a month and there were a house and\nThey just kept bad and the net and things to it and I'm Sorry I just kind of one\nAnd once a month and the warehouse and\nThey just kept adding an adding things to it and I'm\nSorry I just kind of when the uh had printing business that picked up and I found some pretty lucrative jobs I did that for a long time and that was that was good I and when I got it I I like I had mentioned in the past I never really enjoyed\nManaging people 'cause sometimes you know it was just a manual job on the other end of the ad burning machine but it was just also thought that maybe they wouldn't show up or they wouldn't they be complaining or they want more money while you're in and it just\nThat was a first writing and of of that business along with going on and um I had at Torre\nThere's many of them are members of my family die of cancer\nAs time went on I kept coming back home are tell patients that you know what my ears are ringing well and the pad printing business using these uh um oil based inks were pickup damaging to drop it off on the on the item that you're praying\nAnd Peggy said you know what there's there's it's kind of a family business and um\nMaybe this isn't a wise thing to do and so I'm with my family being and having stomach cancer\nAnd everything I thought you know what I brought a crossing guard church that wanted to end up he kept bothering me wanting to bomb a business and I kept telling them you know or he wanted me to teach them how to pay for ... I had to learn on my own and it was really it took if it's caught it from technicalities to it\nAnd so um I thought you know on August sellers and go to this guy or get out of this thing and I'm just I'm On top of the world right now I might as well get out of the top and so\nThat's what I ended up doing and I'm and I'm Glad I did it 'cause I'm Still\nAlive today and Myers aren't rain and I'm saying was I you know that that was a uh but I didn't have problems that's one thing about being a pad\nFor him but it's such a a unique business and there were so much in demand for it and I'm a because a lot of people never heard of it and um I mean I could pick up customers and I just got better and better but you know if you aren't going to be alive what the heck\nYou know to to join in our cars we both needed to do it\nTogether 'cause we're obtain and um she's smarter than I Am and um she makes some better decisions than I Do about eighty percent of the time and um anyway so uh you could you know that\nIt was I knew that lifestyles where we need to be active today and because they talk about everything and really in a way I guess I my background in the past wasn't wasted um\nBecause what happened is it all came back to me with the knowledge from the family from knowledge from um\nUh just you know go into schools and learning about real estate but I had you know I bet there are certain things about the real estate our family you know with uncle Z and all and cousins\nI was kind of disenchanted because of after the passion and my parents and my aunt and uncle you know people there what they are needed to be a plan and greed and be control on things and so I was kind of disenchanted with that and ended in real estate um\nAspect and so until I came across lifestyles and they saw do solve those problems\nOne other thing that kind of got my attention is just\nI just remember my father and uncle born under a deal down in Houston and it was a deal worth it was an apartment complex and I just got out of college and\nUh I they said you know what why don't you go to the closing down in Houston and so they gave me the closing statement and they say we want you to when you get this call the accounting on what you want you to tell them the numbers and everything it's making me this closing statement about what she was\nI said I didn't tell me about this deal and stuff and I said how long have you on this and they said five years and I said\nI got through it analyze it and I thought I saw\nAnalyze the hundred and twenty five percent for five years and I said man I said forget that eight percent stuff I said man this is this is unbelievable we were just limited partners in that situation that was where NASA it's gone in and they'd gotten on a limited partnership and I'm I'm Down in clear like that\nIn that situation that was one NASA is gone and gotten on a limited partnership in uh I'm Down in ... and that's only stuck with me and I thought man this is over the top\nAnd so on that kind of all let me go to the point where you know real estate was ... I'm On I'm the I'm Glad I had done what I'd done in the past and um there was painful going through the argument for family members after our aunts uncles and parents and a passing cars or you know ...\nThey're needed to be a plan and that there wasn't one and so that was a shame\nBut um I've seen everything from trade not poverty and um you know just all the benefits that go with real estate so that that kind of bought me up to that port\nSee we're ready to jump in and you know you you'd you'd seen that real estate work and it's really interesting I'm I'm a second generation real estate investor too and and it's really interesting how our parents don't actually teaches the nitty gritty of the business right into somehow it's something you know side while you pursue that\nTraditional route but Peggy I think you are a lot more skeptical about this weren't you\n\nOh I definitely was Lynn I you know I thought about the money that we'd spent to be trained on a stock options and we actually did tax lane investing for a while\nAnd that was quite an education I don't feel like that was a waste of time um but you know after paying those fees I thought oh no here we go again 'cause those didn't exactly work out long term for us and\nSo we always just hot he was ready to sign up and it was around the holidays the Christian holidays and like every night we each have our own office in our homes because we work out of our home and he\nJust kept coming and going you're going to sign now we got to sign up business the real deal and I still you know I just I don't know so what I did I thought I Need to put a stop to this either right or\nWrong because it was getting stressful around the house so I remember David Fisher who does the um two day training he had mentioned some\nYou know members that were national award winners and these are people competing nationwide as operators of apartment\nAnd lifestyles had won his one I think over the last eleven years than I thought oh whatever you know so I went on lifestyle website to see if I could see their names in idea\nAnd that was really enough so what I did I went on to ... um national apartment association website and I saw their names is actually winning these awards and I thought wow\nI'm right around ... right and some company that can train you to do that\nThat that was the turning point for me so I decided I was ready to join and we always like hallelujah [laughter]\nActually you know that the\nPlayers would come around you know yeah yeah yeah I didn't know she was a member after that second who they\nAre they ...
