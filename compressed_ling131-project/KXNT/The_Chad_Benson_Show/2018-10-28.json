underground economy we have a great job for you plans today we'll begin to show us how\nTo achieve potentially for streams of tax free income in retirement\nFor tax free streams of income and planning for retirement most people when they play into their retirement\nOr saving in tax deferred vehicles like for one k.'s and\nThe recent polarity of annuities et cetera and sometimes those can be appropriate but most of the time all you're doing is building a tax bomb inside of those because those accounts by their nature delayed taxes until the future and in the future\nWe don't know what taxes will be but they are likely to be much higher if we were together one hundred of your family and friends and ask them about taxes are these are likely to be the same lower or higher\nIt's higher if we were to gather one hundred of your family and friends and ask them about taxes are they likely to be the same lower or higher in the future\nMost of them are going to say much higher we believe they will be higher you believe they'll be higher the government's spending shows they will be higher here's another way to ask the question\nWill the government need more or less money in the future more so delaying taxes until the future when taxes are likely to be higher is kind of insane\nThis idea that you'll somehow magically being a lower tax bracket when you retire\nWell if it's not going to happen that used to be a sacred doctor and we never saw it in our practice of nearly two decades much of the time we almost always stay the same or move into a higher tax bracket upon retirement because one hundred percent of the income is taxable\nThis tends to happen because tax delayed plans like for one k.'s and I are raised and pensions of all of a sudden become taxable when you start using them in your retirement and\nThey also cause your Social Security to become unnecessarily taxable in retirement did you know that for one\nOne of the tax liability of IRAs and for one k.'s and pensions are the like\nThe unnecessarily cause your Social Security income to become unnecessarily taxable your Social Security income does not have to be taxable and it can be tax free with proper planning\nWe want to share with you the retirement income maximum is Asian strategy this as a report they were going to do for free today for the first seven people to call today right now\nAnd set up

some reasonable assumptions it also will show you a second path of where we think you could be headed if you start utilizing tax free big holes in strategies\nIt's not really about what's better you know this mutual fund or this annuity it's more about the types of accounts that you choose to save or prepare for retirement\nTaxes can or will be the biggest expense we have in retirement so if we can eliminate those if we can cut that tumor out\nThen we've just saved you massive fees so what does that translate to around here it is it's called rams retirement income maxim as Asian strategies for many this means you can retire\nThree to five years earlier than you thought because it cuts right through the largest free and or they're going to have more encounter retirement than they thought possible\nAnd or it will last longer than you thought possible and sometimes it's all three\nTax free retirement planning is extremely powerful and it has much more to do with how you're playing the game not what pieces you have on the board\nWe often find most people have all the pieces they need for successful retirement there simply poorly positioned on the board when moving the pieces on the board that ruins report looks at what you actually have and what needs to be readjusted and then changes the strategy or formation\nThis is on the board that ruins report looks at what you actually have and what needs to be readjusted and then changes the strategy or formation to look and show you how much more income or how much more longer or how much more earlier as you can retire than you thought\nThat report is free for the first seven colors today right now so please call to set up that first free visit\nIt's a personal as Asian as an actual personalized custom report for you so we can gather a small bit of data and it's all confidential\nTo be able to run the report and share it with you and then you can go from there so called eight seven seven three one seven five nine nine nine okay let's do a case study scenario to show how ... increased\nNow you can see this is very strategic in nature it is not all at once now we also have ten thousand dollars a year that they were giving to contribute to a four one K. that was unmatched by their employer not a good reason because it builds attacks bomb we recapture that ten thousand dollars a year there\nOn matched by their employer not a good reason because it builds attacks bomb\nWe recapture that ten thousand dollars a year\nThey are also paying two thousand dollars for term insurance and four thousand a year for long term care if we recapture those premiums six thousand dollars a year and you'll see why just hang on\nBecause when it's all said and done we have sixty one thousand five hundred here that we can transfer or reposition to the tax rate columns\nAnd get a tax free game in growth\nFrom the time forward potentially okay so let's say you're a student here and you're saying yeah but wait a minute not all of that transfers without tax consequences and that's very true\nThey'll forty thousand dollars Seventy to eighty distribution from the irate is taxable\nNot penalize but it is taxable the ten thousand dollars a year that they were contributing to a four one K. was pre tax so if we contributed to the tax recall them that we're getting to use after the tax dollars\nSo the Seventy two T distribution of forty thousand dollars is really thirty one thousand five hundred after tax withholding\nAnd the four one K. contribution of ten thousand is really seven thousand net after taxes\nThat leaves us with fifty thousand dollars net recapture exactly fifty thousand dollars net to recapture every year to move to the tax free column\nRemember that there are only two accounts that are available in the tax recall them they are the Ross IRA or raw four one K. and a life insurance retirement plan or ... L. A. R. P.\nWe'll talk about each of those briefly but Bob and sue can't contribute a total of sixty five hundred dollars a year each to a Roth IRA let's have that be the first stop in the max account\nBut there's a problem they can only contribute sixty five hundred dollars a year each or Thirteen thousand dollars a year and we've got fifty thousand dollars a year\nThat we need to reposition while Iran fire rate is worthwhile and if you qualify for one you should have won because of the low contribution limits they will never be able to be you know the cornerstone of your retirement they just do not allow you to contribute enough\nBut it is worth having so the first Thirteen thousand a year we're going to have Bob and to put in\nMac sitting out both I raise that grow tax free so long as a few simple rules are followed also remember that income from a ... does not cause your Social Security to become taxable regular IRAs and for one case do\nDo we have Thirteen thousand a year left over to reposition while I Want you to really remember that Bob ensue were not saving more money than they already were\nThey were not assuming higher rates of return\nWe are in fact assuming slightly less but the end result is going to be a powerful thing because this is a process of divorcing the IRS legally from your accounts to ensure tax free income for the future\nYou're going to see that Bob and sue will enter the zero percent tax bracket in retirement well increasing their net income in retirement by over Seventy three percent\nThis is the power of the rooms report retirement income maximum is Asian strategy report\nWe encourage you to be one of the first seven callers\nRight now today okay because we will do seven custom rams reports for free for the first seven like we said that'll set you up with a free visit with us at ... capital so here's the phone number again eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine that's a one seven three one seven\nSaid access capital so here's the phone number again a seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine that's eight one seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine see where you are likely headed the rooms report will show that it also shows where you could be headed\nJust by making a few civil alterations okay what's the end result here for Bob and sue well they were contributing\nThirteen thousand a year and a Roth okay and this tax free scenario assuming a seven percent growth rate from age fifty through sixty five\nThat would grow two or three hundred twenty six thousand dollars\nThe amount they contributed to the life insurance retirement plan thirty seven thousand dollars a year was not going to make seven percent\nWhat can we assume by this it made six point one percent that grew to a tax free nine hundred sixty three thousand dollars by the retirement age of sixty five\nOh right so what kind of income can do is give to us the rough fire re through age Ninety assuming the same rates of return that we did and the first scenario would spit out twenty three thousand dollars a year tax free pretty nice\nThe life insurance retirement plan would spit out one hundred Seventeen thousand nine hundred a year through age Ninety\nSo let me say just a hundred and Eighteen thousand dollars around it out okay just a little bit so one hundred Eighteen thousand dollars a year through age Ninety so that piece alone is more than the entire net income of the first more traditional scenario we did\nIt is more than the Social Security irate or four one K. and mutual fund projected net income combined remember all of that and that was one hundred three thousand dollars will the life insurance retirement plan is just under one hundred Eighteen tax free\nNext we have Social Security remember it was projected for Bob and sue to be twenty four thousand dollars recall the first scenario\nEighty five percent of that was taxable\nNow there's Social Security completely tax free why because both IRA income in lower income do not count as one is called provisional income provisional income means that your Social Security income will likely be taxable now what I'm telling you is\nIRAs and for one case often cause the Social Security income\nTo become unnecessarily taxable but when you do the proper planning it can be a third stream of tax free income silver ... tax free income Social Security income tax free and we'll get the forest tax free stream and just a moment\nLet me talk more about the ... just for a second\nIt's a life insurance retirement plan so yes term life insurance comes with it now you see why we recapture that two thousand dollars a year that Bob and super paying out to the term life insurance right\nBecause the life insurance retirement plan\nHas a term insurance built right into it secondly the tax free death benefit also doubles as long term care\nSo if you needed during your lifetime is a death benefit that you don't have to die to use now you can see why recapture the four thousand dollars a year that Bob and see we're paying toward long term care and disability insurance\nOkay here's the fourth stream of tax free income\nIs from their IRA recall that we were distributing forty thousand a year under the Seventy two T distribution from their IRA right to the tax recall them\nRemember the IRA was still growing at seven percent so it has a value every major evaluated sixty five now we didn't depleted from aids fifty to sixty five it has the remainder value of about three hundred sad\nValue waited sixty five now we didn't depleted from age fifty to sixty five it has the remainder value of about three hundred Seventy four thousand dollars now we can do something with that can weigh\nHow much income should we take from it in order to know we have to understand standards actions if your married filing jointly right now the standards adoptions are twenty four thousand per year\nTwelve thousand for each has been and spouse combined for twenty four thousand\nWhat this means to you is that the first twenty four thousand that would have been taxable income is not taxable as long as we stay under that twenty four thousand standard deduction threshold it's that simple so let's be safe here from the traditional I raise something that is normally taxable\nLet's be safe and take out say fourteen thousand a year well under the twenty four thousand standard deduction threshold and therefore that traditional i._r._a. income\nDistribution will be tax free altogether now the Roth IRA income twenty three thousand a year tax free the one hundred and Seventeen thousand nine hundred a year from the alert\nTax free the Social Security income uh twenty four thousand a year and on top of that this fourteen thousand ear distribution from the traditional i._r._a. attacks re because it's standard deductions although this total us up to one hundred and Seventy eight thousand nine hundred per year tax free\nWhat was the prior scenario the more traditional scenarios net income again\nOne hundred three thousand dollars doing proper planning is simply shifting assets around you use more tax efficient strategies the net income is increased by over Seventy three percent a year\nAnd they were not investing more or saving more or earning higher rates of return none of that it was simply playing smarter and repositioning what was already on the board\nThey already have the pieces needed for over Twenty years of retirement this second tax free strategy produced more than one and a half million dollars additional throughout retirement now if these results were produced over Twenty years over a thirty year return period\nAlmost two point three million dollars more results\nWe would like to share with you the rooms report retirement income maxim is Asian strategy and now you can do a little bit with that and you can see behind the scenes of what they might provide for you know these are more detailed when they are personalized and that's what we're giving away today\nSeven free personalized rooms reports we show you where you're likely headed and where you could be headed with a few alterations on the board called eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine that's the phone number eight seven seven three one seven\nUh when they share the hatchery strategy called fully\nA lot of times you react with a while\nThat you know that's kind of a strange thing you know buying life insurance a mom and dad but when we approach mom and dad about it you know what they're going to say their eyes are going to light up and they're going to think this is such a great idea this is awesome and I mean they're going to grab bond as they wish you've done it earlier seriously\nBut mom and dad often see this as a way that you know the kids are helping out I mean they're doing something for us and it also let's mom and dad off the hook for worrying about and inheritance you've taken care of that it allows them to focus on their money for their lifetime without having to worry about the next generation\nAnd the kids the middle generation you the forty or fifty year olds et cetera who paid for their premiums yet a lump sum that his tax free with mom and dad eventually decide it's time to move on to the next life with them\nHaving left behind their own mortal endowment for the next generation and oh by the way that lump sum is guaranteed and tax free as right\nSo what can I give you some examples on this I think the math is compelling but I also

can likely expect their retirement because of tax free strategies or it will show you maybe you know how you can retire earlier that he thought your both\nBut the big thing here the big big thing here is that you can cut out the largest fee that you have in your vestments or retirement planning which is taxes off that people find that could even retire three to five years earlier\nOr they'll have a lot more income in retirement than they thought possible or the money will last longer than they thought were all three All right so you get your free rooms report right but we're also giving away a copy of the power of zero to you\nA great book on the retirement planning by David McKnight so called eight seven seven three one seven fifty nine Ninety nine right now call in\nAnd set up that free visit with us right now\nOkay so let me give you some examples on family owned life insurance as a fit stream of tax free retirement planning so let's say dad is sixty nine years old and the kids\nAre within advisor who knows what the heck is going on with them approach dad about a fully ... family owns life insurance\nLet's say for example that they approached at and say hey dad we want to buy you a five hundred thousand dollar policy or death benefit for your dad is in decent health and the premiums are about ten thousand five hundred a year\nFor a permanent policy one that will last as long as dad does okay and and I'll tell you why because term will likely laps before it's used its engineered that way according to the Louvre dot org life insurance marketing research association\nNinety nine percent of term insurance policies are never used why not because they are designed to run out before life expectancy in that respect\nTerm is very very expensive because you were just throwing twenty thirty forty fifty dollars a month away and it doesn't work for this approach for family own life insurance at all I mean we wish it did because otherwise it would be nice but it doesn't work\nIt's engineer to lapse before it is used now the permanent policy has to use fully so he can choose any amount of life insurance you know for the policy and yeah do I mean does it have to be five hundred thousand dollars for a death benefit\nAh we're assuming on dad in this example yeah OK but it doesn't have to be I mean who knows I mean if you could afford a hundred thousand dollar death benefit\nThat would be fine as well so the math it's still math and it's still compelling because if you can afford to buy a two million dollar policy on mom and dad with your siblings\nThat would be fantastic but for this example say let's just stick with the five hundred thousand dollar death benefit policy a permanent policy on dad who is sixty nine years old and a decent health not awesome but these it was ten thousand five hundred a year being the ...\nPolicy on dad who was sixty nine years old and a decent health not awesome but these it was ten thousand five hundred a year being the premium okay now remember this is a great part of retirement and you're planning that's about eight hundred Seventy five dollars a month\nNow if you broke it down remember you can scale up or scaled down these numbers\nAnd often the cost is being split between siblings so this is a planned you're absolutely going to get a lot from\nThe numbers I usually mom and dad loved it too because of what they are doing for their kids or grandkids the life expectancy according to the tablets for sixty nine year old male is fourteen point twenty two years so dad's life expectancy has just passed\nSay age eighty three now we all want to live as long as humanly possible and nothing here changes that one mortality is still a fact but dad has said what\nWait a minute if this was going to be you know this is going to happen anyway which it it's going to for all of us I mean if you will die\nThat's ridiculous what is the rate of return for the kids are on the full term on this tax free stream of tax free guaranteed lump sum for the future if dad lived a life expectancy All right it is Fifteen point twenty six percent tax free in other words the premium of ten thousand five hundred year\nProduces in fourteen point twenty two years of dad's life expectancy if he passed away right then\nTen thousand five hundred a year created a five hundred thousand dollar tax free lump sum that has guarantee and tax free\nThat and the rate of return is Fifteen point twenty six percent tax free now can you tell me where you can find that rate of return with a guaranteed known lump sum at the end that his tax free\nNow the rate of return is guaranteed here by the tax free lump sum is not\nThe rate of return isn't guaranteed it's because we don't know when dad will pass away\nWe know he will unfortunately we don't know when you know four one K. assuming at thirty percent tax bracket what we do have to earn on the guaranteed basis or tax equivalent return at comparing to the fifty point twenty six percent tax free return on the ... you'd have to make\nTwenty three points sixty nine percent knowing that the end would be guaranteed and that the lump sum at the end\nWould be right over twenty almost twenty four percent so come on you'd have to make almost twenty four percent in like a mutual funds or stock or bonds or ATF freer to compete with the fully FOLS by the tax free lump sum making\nFor for this example would would make about Fifteen and a quarter percent according to our example here okay well that's not going to happen you're not even close to Fifteen and a quarter percent tax free when you know the end is guaranteed\nThat guaranteed lump sum now can you see how this might fit as part of your overall strategy for retirement yes you should be investing or saving money for retirement where there is a match in a four one K. yes you should be saving perhaps\nIn a rough hire a if you qualify and yeah you could be saving a life insurance retirement plans well on a monthly your annual basis\nProbably because it's tax free and has a long term care built into it\nAll that stuff yeah they're going to happen should family owned life insurance or at the end is known and guarantee it'd be a part of this let's find out the first seven today to set up our free visit with us to discuss tax free strategies which is really to say\nThis let's find out that
