accent cheese no here's some more conventional wisdom says you know the man on a mission to retire American one for each other moms and he\nWrote back to the radio show where the hype in and help begins there today I'm Talking about all kinds of just actual stuff\nYour life about my life and about the things that I picked up I didn't know the last two weeks now uh because I was in the hospital for a period of time and it's an interesting story because all of my life or not all my life in later years when I was no longer competitive athlete and I'm\nReally was retired at a very early age I didn't have a lot to do uh I picked up the habit of drinking alcohol and I'll I'll never affected me quite the way it does everybody else I was able to drink\nGet drunk get up the next day and go to work and do whatever I Need to do or get up and survive I never had hangovers I'd never really had any problems but I just came to the conclusion that\nAll right this is stifling me in some way shape or form and always talk to people about why do you smoke why does why is that why you that whatever\nAnd I just wondered what would be on the other side of not drinking so I decided to stop drinking ... the whole but I've stopped drinking what happened was you know your body is used to getting all that sugar each and every glass of wine\nOr your drink whatever it is you sit back relax and your body goes all thank you I needed to\nRelax or so when I stopped drinking I and I just stopped cold turkey people said do you know you should do something about drinking maybe go somewhere look let me tell you something I don't know what's right for you what wrong for you or whatever but when people told me I should stop drinking I said I Am not going to go to ...\nNot going to go to a rehab clinic because that's sick people and they're sick people teaching sick people to be sick\nThey're telling you that you are sick they're telling you that you have a problem that you can't overcome that problem in that your goal for the rest of your life as you get up every day and not drink\nAt is not my goal I stopped drinking multiple times in my life where I just because people say you drink too much what is it OK outside of ... and I just stop\nAnd I've stopped now for three weeks and I didn't have any kind of a reaction to it whatsoever they said well you need to be in there they need to give you drugs while you stop drinking blah blah blah blah blah and all that stuff you know might be right for somebody\nBut my drinking was on purpose\nBy drinking was because I wanted to come in relax my brain is going a thousand miles an hour I was built to go out there and when\nWhether it be athletics or business or whatever to be successful my brain goes a thousand miles an hour goes twenty four seven I Can't sleep in fact when I stopped drinking I went three days in a row\nWhere I slept one hour at night\nThat was the one side effects of that I couldn't sleep because there was nothing there was no doubt earners in my system to take me down and it never bothered me the next year was up I didn't feel like I didn't sleep it's a weird weird deal now what am I tell you on this because we're not much interest as a couple of things that I figured out over the last two weeks\nAnd one of them is is that too many of us believe that were helpless\nAnd that we we're cripples that we needed crutch and that just isn't true\nYou know I'm sure there's somebody out there is going to say oh you're crazy you have to have these rehab clinics you have to have these twelve step programs guys that was during a three to five bottles of wine and night I stopped cold turkey\nThat was at the bottom line is people drank not because they need the alcohol\nYes eventually your body starts to crave the alcohol and I used to get the five o'clock cravings is like my fiance would always laughing because it's five o'clock\nWhich yep I buy and if I get the five o'clock and I could get a drink and booms all okay everything's fine but the five o'clock cravings is all they ever got these I I Know people that get up in the morning and start drinking vodka them they get out of bed\nRight this is a different kind of alcoholism\nBut it still comes down to the weakness of the mind because I look at like my daughter had alcoholism for a while she went and got treatment or got help now she's a competitive bodybuilder she's on a national stage she's and ripped to shreds the shape of her life\nThere's no there's no you are an alcoholic you are a loser you are this you or that and yet we let people believe that about themselves what I'm trying to tell you is\nThe problem you really have is you really have nothing in life the reason I started drinking 'cause I'd already made all my money I'd already want all my body building contest and already done everything that I wanted to do my bucket list in life had been checked off\nAnd there was nothing left me to do get up in a day do my radio shows and give back to society go to a few events where I Would help them talk to people in teaching motivate whatever it was it the rest of my life is really nothing for it I I worked in my garden and I've got you know giant yard they spend most of my time working on\nBut the point is is that I decided to stop\nAnd just see what happens how many of you can just stop doing this stupid stuff you're doing like paying off your mortgage like putting money in\nAnd just see what happens how many of you can just stop doing this stupid stuff you're doing like paying off your mortgage like putting money in a four one K. you are blind Lee addicted to the stupid financial stuff that you're doing as well as most people who are addicted to alcohol and drugs\nYou can't stop yourself\nWe had a seminar out in uh Las Vegas and I got emails back for people who are like oh my God you can't expect us to stop contribute out four one K. you can't expect us take our money\nAbout four one K. you can't expect us to not have a home paid in full I Know do you are drunk on a date bringing up see\nYou're out of your mind drug up on somebody else's belief systems because those belief systems do not work and will not work towards becoming financially free and especially rich wealthy\nAbove and beyond the average person and so as like propped up in this alcohol which is interesting was is I started eating something at night that I'd never eaten before I started being like fruit nuts and stuff stuff that we normally think is healthy\nBut what I realized she was all that stuff is the kind of stuff that irritates something called dire ridiculous or something like that ... stomach disease\nAnd they tested disease where there's power ups and stuff and all that stuff got in my stomach and all of a sudden I had ... a um event you know it hurt and it hurt really bad so I went to the hospital emergency room and they took X rays and said yeah you got a hole in your town\nAnd so now I'm sitting here in the hospital for six days under massive medication like living on water liquid diet jello that kind of stuff [laughter]\nI'm just sitting there going to like you know number one I'm so happy that I don't have to worry about my business as my money my finances or whatever that I have the time and the energy to be able to take care of stuff like this\nBut was it was gone once I got out of it they sent me home I got a tube and my stomach I'll be getting it out soon but it's a drain the drain all of the infected materials out of my body won all kinds of antibiotics but I feel great don't get me wrong I mean I can run a mile right now back to the doctor said I've been over the bridge that you'd\nBe feel better if you get up and walk a little bit so what did I Do I Do like twenty five laps around the whole wing\nOf the hospital I mean there's the athlete in Iraq you can see me running\nOr walking withholding might you know the thing it feeds stuff into your arm you know I'm rolling it and I'm walking around like try to do it fast like trying to get it from exercising right and the guys with than you are it over and she would go yes I Know that's why I had to take alcohol was to stop being an over achiever and slow back down\nPretty shabby to be honest with you back then but still I had my way through it ended up with a hundred houses then I decided to get rid of the hundred houses start buying apartment complexes and I bought small apartment\nI remember having attenuated apartment complex it was making me two thousand dollars a month I was making two hundred dollars a month and each unit will see two hundred a month types and those two thousand dollars a month twenty four thousand a year tax free\nWas phenomenal I did almost nothing to run the ten year it was simple\nAnd I was making additional two thousand dollars a month tax free then I went out and bought myself a from the twenty I went and bought a thirty unit the thirty unit was making me tremendous amount of money three thousand four thousand bucks a month something like that uh and now I was making more money\nYou know tax free that I was making you know ever at my job by double and then went on about a forty unit\nMade some money and then I went and bought a six year and the sixty four you know it was really the that was the ... that was the turning point for everything the sixty four unit was making me about ten thousand dollars a month by itself forget about all the other stuff this one property I put a hundred and fifty thousand dollars down\nTo buy that today you'd probably have to put probably five hundred thousand dollars down to buy that property um but I bought it and after I bought that one about the one across the street and I bought the one next to it and then I bought two of them around the corner so here I was\nMaking like fifty thousand dollars a month with five apartment complex\nWas phenomenal it was phenomenal just money was just rolling and it was tax free money right there it was boom boom boom boom boom just rockets\nAnd at that point you know I pretty much quit in my brain I'm making more money than I ever ever ever dreamed of making when I was a kid\nAnd at that point that says you know I pretty much quit in my brain I'm making more money than I ever ever ever dreamed of making when I was a kid I thought about making a hundred grand a year my dad never made a hundred grand a year that was going to be the ... and here I was making fifty grand a month tax free\nAnd I I really I didn't know where to go from there I read books I tried to hang out with people like try to get ideas but really I was so far ahead of everybody I knew that I had nobody to really lead me to the next level to where I should go\nRight and then\nThat lifestyles mentoring all these people some people came in were way more aggressive I lost my badge I had decided that it was over this season of my life was my growth was over that's the season I was living in [noise]\nI had more real estate anybody else in the group ah had prestige people knew me I was doing seminars um I was on the radio and everything seemed like okay you've arrived\nBut then some guys came in and started buying way more realistic than I did one guy came in about two hundred and forty units that are in one apartment then a couple of months later bought four hundred and eighty units and all of a sudden the guy was had more units and I did\nAnd then he bought a portfolio and it just went on and on people's just started following these guys and buy more and more and more and more real estate\nAnd I'm thinking wow this is incredible but wait\nI'm totally happy I shouldn't worry about the fact that these guys are making more money and buy more properties than I Am ... why shouldn't even care and and then rationalize myself I don't care I'm not greedy I don't care what these guys do I like helping people make more money than me\nBut one day somewhere along the line the season of my life changed\nAnd I said you know the only reason why I don't want to go out there and do all this is because I just don't want to do it all I'm at that point in my life where I've lock to wipe down it's simple\nSo what I did was I went out and found a guy and you guys know ms John Johnny Lama rich way and I talk to him out of working in corporate America he was vice presidents second largest management company of the country I said look why don't you come to lifestyles\nAnd I will set you up a portfolio properties I'll buy them you manage them will be partners in the deal\nAnd then you'll be able to give up your job because you need income I Will produce a job for you income for you and he agreed to do it took me about two years to get him into the place but then we went out we bought for apartment complexes in a row and daresay\nWe destroyed with these apartment complexes my whole image of how much money can be made completely changed I made more money for years\nThat I had made in forty years previous to that because now\nI was doing this not only from my own self satiation but for John and all of our partners in everybody else's involved and I thought man I got to go out there and do something we got to do something big we got out there and the excitement was back so here I Am I'm In a new\nSeason of my life\nI'm now a syndicator I'm now playing big I'm trying to keep up with the big boys are running the big giant deals and we bought a hundred and forty unit two hundred and fifty six unit at two hundred and Seventy you to three hundred Twenty years so we just kept growing and growing\nAnd growing and growing now during that time we made some massive uncommitted\nSo we just kept growing growing growing and growing now during the time\nWe made some bad for the job of today I right now by about four properties this year so far about ... tried to buy my fifth what right now and I was looking in my personal financial stick with it and I just looked at this and it just blew my mind about how credible\nThe money made on these properties were when we come back from the break 'cause I don't want a short\nShort this thing I Want to go to go into a show you we made so much money\nIn a ... year period of time or whatever it was I don't know what it was two thousand two thousand uh see we got a sixteen about eight years we made so much money that you're just blow your mind and that was an additional season of my life it\nIt wasn't until that season was over that I had received she aided that season\nIt might break and then I really done more to ever dream of doing that I started drinking because there was nothing left will take a short break be right back with the do well to reduce\n[noise]\nYou're listening to the
