data that they resent is pretty much the same so they're pulling their data from national databanks facts figures and then they have to make interpretations of what's happening\nThe challenges is it

[noise]\nI Love your back you know here's some more money conventional wisdom is just as you read the man on a mission to retire American one version and there's still wants to\nGet back to do on the radio show today I'm trying to make a point for the fact that markets although they can be cyclical we believe them to be cyclical I Believe cycles can expand\nNow what do I mean by that what I mean is is that if you have\nOne dollar it only takes one dollar to be a hundred percent return a hundred percent return on one dollar the dollar so the cycle can go from hurting you ten percent return which is ten cents\nTo a twenty percent return which is twenty cents down to a nothing returned very easily but what if you're earning not a dollar or two hundred thousand\nYou would think that it would make sense it's a complete would be just as easy to go from you know ten percent return which would be ten thousand dollars and twenty ... twenty thousand you would think those numbers on the line\nBut I just use those numbers do not all that the larger the number is the harder it is to get it to ...\nThat's a strange concept but I Believe this is my whole life I've noticed back when I was buying real estate when I first started those by very very expensive stuff cheap stuff old stuff worn out stuff and I could er twenty thirty percent return on cash flow from day one but it was only paying ten thousand dollars a unit for that\nAbout that how would you make that kind of percentage change when something's two hundred thousand dollars a door when someone's paying thirty five hundred and four thousand dollars a month rent\nHow do you raise the rent well let's see I raised in a hundred bucks that's nothing percentage wise where when people were paying four hundred dollars a month rent and I raise it to five hundred that was a twenty five percent rate increase but a hundred and thirty five hundred is not think\nSo what I'm suggesting you is the cycle has scaled to the point where the returns have got to go down because the cost of getting in the business is so high\nYet at the same token the cycle has expanded so we're we take you X number of days to get from point a to point B and then to point to see an end to point the and then to hit the end of the cycle and come back to a point again that that period of time has to change\nIt has to change almost directly with the size of the change because it takes\nLonger to make those larger changes large enough\nTo send the cycle through it's loops now this is just projection this is my theory no economists out there or spouse in this um espousing a cause I step back now for twenty seven years and had to watch every single years my members invest and buy real estate\nYear after year after year and every once in a while every like four years ago I said man we are peaking in this market he's probably going to be over by next year and then next year after that I go you know what I think we are peaking\nLast year I decided to some real estate properties off 'cause I thought we had gone past the peak and we were on the edge of a bubble while I was selling Curtis was by\nWe discuss their notes we share notes and although I got out of this historic highs be able to get back in I'm going to have to get back in and historic highs so\nLet's take a look at some of the numbers will start with single family home work this whole seminar not dissimilar talk radio show will work this through two departments let's start with single\nFamily houses right now first time homebuyers are thirty two percent of all the buyers and the problem with that is is that\nThey don't build small houses anymore let me give you an example the median home right now is two hundred and forty eight thousand dollars the average home\nIs three hundred and thirty one thousand dollars now let's go back to when I bought my first home\nI purchased my first rental property at twenty five thousand dollars at the time the media and was fifty thousand right so let's think about this I bought her to fifty cents on the media will the mediums two hundred and forty\nThat means we can buy houses a hundred and twenty and still be buying them at the same the same discount I was buying at the bottom of a recession in other words when it was the absolute best time to buy with the world had exploded and things were going for fifty\nOn the dollar I was buying a fifty cent to the median price\nWell guess what books were still buying houses eighty Ninety a hundred thousand dollars hundred and ten a hundred and twenty all day long which is below fifty percent of the median price we are killing it\nAnd not realizing it because those prices are higher than we've ever been willing to pay in the investment world\nThat the stuff that's being built is higher than it's ever cost in history and the people coming out to buy their home now the first time home they're looking at prices two hundred and forty thousand\nTwo hundred and up\nAnd so who are these first time homebuyers usually the millennials twenty five to thirty thirty five years of age got their first big paying job maybe just got married or have a you know relationship maybe had their first baby and they're living with mom and dad they got to get out\nBut to get out they got to come up with the price of the two hundred and fifty thousand dollar home\nThat's a big chunk to pay for it really is\nI remember when I got out I first home I bought was a condo for forty thousand bucks and I mean forty thousand compared to two hundred and forty thousand I Know it's Thirty years later forty years later whatever it is but it's still massively different\nSo how does that hook up with the apartment is back when I first got a new apartment business or buying apartments that were old worn out tired low in stop for ten thousand dollars a door the high end stuff the stuff I really want to do but I couldn't afford it was like forty thousand fifty thousand\nAnd the median home prices back then were like a hundred thousand dollars so I ... I remember I got\nOut of single family housing because single family house as the media went to Seventy five thousand Seventy six thousand somewhere I said man is the housing business just getting too expensive and you can't buy a house for Seventy six thousand dollars and make any money with it\nSo I Would do apartments where I could buy these old beat up apartments for cheap and fix them up and make some money or what but if you look back and say okay\nBack then we were buying apartments anywhere from for bottom beating stuff like I was buying a ten thousand or door to really nice cutting edge stuff for forty or fifty thousand a door\nAt houses really selling for Seventy six thousand or we were paying percentage wise the value of a new home\nVery very close nowadays it's not so real we're not even that close we're not even close to close what we're paying for apartment doors compared to practice will blow your mind and I'm going to come back after the break and go into it\nAnd the fact that there's tons of cash sitting around waiting to get into these deals gives you even more by so as the millennials come out in the world changes from you know an old folks right to the millennials\nThey now have the belief that they don't necessarily want to own a home\nThey don't like upkeep they deliver with their parents have been ten it's for the first Thirty years of their life now to be tenants with freedom of not living in mom and dad's house it's like total freedom\nThey're spoiled and they want nice amenities so they can't afford to buy little crappy home and a crappy neighborhood they're not going to do that this all leads them to demand\nHas more and more millennials are wanting to move in to the household world in other words owned their own household by themselves\nThere's more and more demand for apartments and not as much demand for houses because they can't afford to buy those houses\nThey don't have the buying power to buy those expensive houses twenty five percent down no no I think you buy on rocky but you know five percent down but you have to be able to stand for the mortgage payments you have to pay for all the maintenance repair mowing the yard or utilities or a bit\nSo it is sending demand over to the apartment industry so there's more demand for the department industry\nAnd the apartment industry is putting up more supply so what happened in two thousand eight\nWhen the recession hit they stop building\nSo to nine to ten to Lebanon not until about two twelve did you start seeing apartments come back on line and when they did there was a shortage of apartments there was a shortage of housing for many years so what happens is boom big giant swing the pendulum and everybody jumps and started building stuff\nBut they're building class race there is no more class bees and class sees they stopped giving naming anything a class de if it's a building it's a classy now even if it's a piece of garbage and bad part of town they're calling classy they've eliminated the designation de\nBecause everything that you could put a human being in his rent a boat in this day and age\n[noise] that's a market ship books I mean when I got in the businesses were deeds there was stuff that people shouldn't live in and they're not even condemning it and they're going hey anything you put a body and nowadays is a sea that's blue collar living wow\nTell me this market hasn't changed tell me the curb as a change of cycle hasn't changed it's unbelievable what else control supply and demand how about jobs\nRight now at the lowest unemployment level since twenty thirty forty fifty years ago I don't know whether it was but it's been a long time\nLess than four percent you're now in a situation we were when I was growing up where there was called I'm\nUnderemployed in other words there's no it was over ... over employment there's so many people have jobs and so many jobs wanting people that it's a wonder we don't have inflation\nWhatever they're doing the fed is doing something that's holding down inflation fairly well because now it's going to be driven by the fact that people can start getting higher wages\nNow Mary that with what Donald Trump just in\nThis new tax law is going to change things dramatically companies are going to make twenty five percent more money than they were paying forty two percent tax at the corporate level now they're paying twenty five\nPercent cutting taxes guys these companies are going to be gushing with cash so when there's a lack of people to work for them when they're trying to expand these wonderfully profitable businesses\nThey're going to have to offer higher wages I had much to have come to me already and so you know do I think we have a higher offer offer higher wages for people even like our entry level people you know a receptionist and stuff a lot more money now because you can go out on the street wow it's happening\nSo people are going to have more money right so there's going to be more money to buy with\nBuying indexes they're all on\nConsumer indexes that study how people feel about the future they're all up\nEverybody except the talking heads on TV Democrats believe the Trump is going to blow this thing apart it's gonna become incredibly positive\nFor everybody because you don't believe in trickle down economics that's fine I I get that but the bottom line is when there's more money out there and there's less jobs are there's more jobs than there are people wages have to go up\nAnd they're going to offer everybody doesn't matter whether you're white black Hispanic Chinese Indian wages are going up\nAnd so you've got this perfect storm\nWhere the economy is booming where we're at the point in the cycle when you'd say the cycle should be shutting down now it should be over\nBut it's the beginning of a new peak because wherever the Trump did\nWow think of that now one more thing they've slowed down the amount of new apartment complex was coming on line two thousand Eighteen will bring less product on line the two thousand seventeenth did yet two thousand Eighteen we'll have more demand\nMore demand less supply higher rants higher occupancy it's common votes it's all happening right before our eyes the economists are saying it and they're ... holding their breath going I Can't predict what\nThis is going to do because it doesn't make sense and I don't want to be wrong I'm sitting here right now saying I'm willing to be wrong gets happen will take a short break and one's race [noise]\n\nYou're listening to their
