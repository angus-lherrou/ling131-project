just losing my mind over this\nMisrepresentation so financial planner stockbrokers and the whole industry out there who's telling you lives one light specific is that real estate or the stocks are way more profitable than real estate is and this guy is like seven reasons the main argument\nThat they come up with as you look historically the stock market has progressed it ten percent per year and historically real estate is appreciate the former city or they're just killing everything that we do with real estate we don't buy real estate hole for appreciation\nThat is just not what we do these guys do not understand the thing they're talking about\nAnd a real estate investor does it by a piece of real estate hope it goes up in value\nHey maybe you bought your home and hope it goes up but that's not what investors do and if you're an investor and that's what you're doing that you don't know what you're doing either right so the next when they're talking about is lower transactional costs you ... you know you can trade to stock revived I'll go look you could buy stock and make no money at all have no evidence right\nPay taxes or whatever gains you make\nBut by God you can buy that stock only five dollar trade wow that's really a ... or you could buy a piece of real estate that puts out ten to twenty percent ... percent sometimes\nA cash flow which is you know the highest casualty we'll go out there right\nLong term in like five years a burial liquid come and go back to that liquidity arguments very a liquid but you know you get a you know five your CD or two percent or where it's this real estate stuff we shoot for between eight\nAnd a Fifteen Percent sometimes you see the deals like we bring on all the time over Fifteen Percent twenty twenty five percent gas well they don't have any of that\nWe have not only the four percent appreciation we have forced appreciation and you saw there yesterday where the people were saying they they pulled out\nIn two years I think it was a two hundred and fifty percent return for their investors to hundred and sixty eight to be exact now if I remember right and uh you don't see that in the stock market there's no two hundred sixty eight percent return in the stock market so what's the difference if we make\nAnd I think that they said they made it till they had like two million in the deal I'm let's just say a million let's say you put a million in a deal and you make two hundred percent with that that'd be two million and now you've got to pay fifty thousand dollars to get out\nOr you could buy some stocks that don't make you anything pay you know to evidence you have to pay taxes on whatever money you might gain if you do have a game and you can do that for five dollars\nWow that just doesn't sound like that impressive bubble point on seven reasons why stocks are better than real estate the third one is it's less work\nWow now how the heck you've come by that\nThe bottom line is if you're going to go pick stocks yourself the amount of research you would have to do would be on oddly\nI Know when we were when I was day trading back in the day I'm you know we were reading the newspaper every day all the articles in journals you can listen to all the news you could try to figure out what was the next big play it was a full time job trading stocks\nOr you can handed over to somebody else and let them do it for you which means there's less work\nNow in real estate we are the same thing we can go out there and operated our own business\nAnd it'd be a hundred percent involve making a fulltime job or we can hire a management company the manager of business more than just be the asset manager portion of the deal and if we don't even want to be the asset manager which is just telling the by telling the management company what our goals are\nWe can become a passing duster and let the lead bbs at manager the management company managed the property and the onsite people do the work\nHow can they say that there's less work than none zero we don't have to locate evaluate negotiate contract close finance operate anything\nThat's not less work guys\nThat's more work\nTo go out there and figure out what all the stocks and bonds and things you want to put yourself in now again you can just blindly turn it over somebody else let them do it all for you and then there's no work at all granted but that's not an argument that makes stocks better than real estate this guy doesn't understand\nWhat the options are whoever this guy is I've never heard of this guy before Sean man you shouldn't be writing articles about stuff you don't understand it just\nI don't know if the rest of you out there irritated by it or not but you know you hear\nEvery time you get on the radio or TV you hear the same stuff and what's funny is you know I'm\nThe guy on this radio station here he talked about you know the to the left or the right left or the right now it's not even a left or right it's a left and the right they're both spewing the same garbage out day in day out there for some reason\nIs more diversification they're saying wow you can't own properties how lose San Francisco Rio Amsterdam all over the world but if you own stock you can almost to accept any company in the world again this guy has no idea what he's talking about\nThese are investing it deals themselves investing it deals with other people and they're investing deals that have the diversification of different operators\nThe diversification of different locations the diversification of different types of deals in other words a value plays and you'll place and the diversification geographically whether I Want to have my stuff in California I Wonder how much stuff at Florida Atlanta Houston Dallas\nWe have maximum\nMaximum diversification and again this guy has no idea he thinks the all you can do is buy something right in your own town where you live\nBecause he doesn't know what he's talking about so was my bitch about today my argument is not that these guys are right or wrong they are definitely wrong they cannot put together an argument that proves that they're not wrong that they're right\nMy argument is they get to view this stuff on radio and TV in the Internet without anybody being able to come back and argue that point against them they have suffered themselves within their own little zones of mediocrity\nWhy because they make their living selling you this stuff that's why this is how they make a living they don't make a living by picking successful investments\nThey're not investors\nThey don't care if you're stocks go up or down they just care if they get paid they're getting paid whether your stocks go up or down they're getting paid\nRight\nJust crazy stuff the next one which makes no sense at all number five is the ability to investment products you love\n\nWhat you care what you were invested\nWhat do you care the product you okay we can invest the products we love hey I have a senior citizens property I used to have I loved that I really loved helping senior people we are low income properties all man I really love helping low income housing people to get a nice clean place to live\nHey we've got some resorts stuff man I Love owning some resorts stuff\nI can invest in this stuff I Love it just so happens what I Love\nIs something real what do I mean by that how would you like to have a boyfriend or girlfriend or spouse that wasn't real it was just a piece of paper or a computer program\nAnd it should be the same stuff to you every day when you've got other bad good morning Mr ... I Hope you had a good evening Mr ... I Hope that your life will be wonderful today Mr what because it just a computer program it's jazz rat tat tat tat tat tat\nTat none of it real that's what you got the stockbrokers financial planners\nThere's no real investment there but with a piece of real estate my friends you own something tangible I've never lost a piece of real estate never had one run away never had somebody steel one they're All right where I bought him and they stay there until I sell\nBecause it's safer because I lost forty percent of my net worth in stocks\nThis guy is so wrong his argument is so upside down and silly you wonder how he even gets published maybe he pays to publish is I don't know whatever and number seven fewer taxes and fees\nAre you out of your mind have you totally lost it does this guy even bother to do any research before he writes something Sean Sean come on Sean real estate investors when done correctly don't pay any taxes\nTheir income you pay taxes on everything you do every single transaction that you make money and you're paying taxes on how the heck can you say there's less taxes and fees oh there's a because there's property taxes they don't have property taxes you don't need property taxes because you don't own anything you own a piece of paper\nAnd the only game to get his capital gains and that's all tax them by the way even if they threw out some evidence that would be taxed\nAt the property taxes\nWe pay come out of our net are gross proceeds to allow us to the net proceeds so we were talking to you about the rate of return that's net of the property taxes you dumb completely ignorant person writing articles\nThere's no way you should be allowed to write articles hey if I was going to write something I Would go look up the facts before I went and rode something it made a fool out of myself this is just the most ridiculous article I've ever seen in my life there is no seven ways why stock it better real estate he's named seven reasons real estate\nIs better than stocks and my friends if you can't see that\nIf you live in that world he lives in I'm not going to call you and me I'm going to call you financially insecure I'm going to call you living a life of quiet desperation\nThat people become real estate investors when done correctly the way we teach it between two and five years generally replaced the earned income\nReplace the earned income with passive income wow now that leads me to the next article and a half\n[noise] this was written by CNBC see NBC up it's an article about Tony Robbins and his feelings about what is a financially secure or you know wealthy person and Tony Robbins talks about the fact that\nShe thinks it being wealthy is a using a ... a few wealthy ICU safe and secure\nTone Tony Tony you're worth four hundred million bucks I look you up\nYou won't feel the you are wealthy and what you're telling people is that if if they just learn to live with what\nThey have and and he he says it's something like this I'm not going to read the whole already because I didn't even print the whole article said something like if you just learned to appreciate what you already have\nAnything above that becomes well you feel wealthy I've said many times the only way you feel wealthy is if you're so rich you have enough to give away and give back\nThere is no given away and give it back for these people donate their barely even making enough money to retire\nYou're feeling concept although intellectually makes sense\nYou know we always want how much money one more dollars ... we have right now only plays out for people that have the lack of mentality the G ... some game that I have to take a dollar for new for me to have a dollar but in the abundance mentality that we live in everybody can be rich and then I don't\nMean fuel rich I mean the the rich\nThat's something that you can't even imagine Tony as you had them walking on polls that's an incredible thing I walked on colds I'm Still poor\nAs I was before I started I still have to get it Monday morning go to work my I'm motivated to get up and go to work but I still got to get up and go to work all the fire to walk and you do Tony isn't doing nothing towards helping these people financially because you got them for you and good about their financial situation you have not help\nThem with their financial situation the article goes on and says here's how we break down\nWhether or not you're wealthy and it comes down to how long can you live if you lost your job tomorrow and he says if you can live on the month you're broke\nIf you can live one to three months you're teetering if you could live three to six months you're satisfactory three to six months survival is satisfactory okay six months to two years\nAs well off well let's hope when you retire guys you don't live past two years let's get our death certificate ready we'll get a stamp ourselves out in two years because hey Courtney what it says here\nYou know six months to two years well off now two years to five years and you are wealthy that's it bugs you're living on ten thousand bucks a year but you can live on it for five years in a row ten grand a year you're wealthy makes no sense at all\nWhat is the quality of lifestyle that you can live five years live like a broke poor person and you're going to call that wealthy because you feel safe you can last five years\nFive or more years is ultra wealthy well guess what everybody lifestyles are limited that does what we do have to feel ultra wealthy you know why because once you replace your earned income with passive income you can survive the rest of your life\nDid you hear that the rest of your life then you can address lots of your family and they can live the rest of their life\nThere's a lot of those unlimited is old will will take a break right back a woman\n...
