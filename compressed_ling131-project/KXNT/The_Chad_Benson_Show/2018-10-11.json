talking forty F am ex ante welcome back now here's some more conventional wisdom says you know the man on a mission to retire American one version of this month she\nWrote about da da de ... to cover the sad sad story of why the common person out there\nOr can't get ahead in life and what we're perceptions about the world and weaknesses they have the human beings to keep them from coming successful we're doing a case study on an email the gentleman sent me about how from his early life he's changed his his skill set over and over and over again to try to stay ahead of ah\nOf societies or ...\nOr ... which were protected logical advancements and he has not been able to keep up and I'm going to pick it back up or is that you just became a programmer and he says since there was a lot of demand for programmers back then I was making a lot of money and figure that finally found the courage to rely on those stop right there for a second I was making a lot of money where it's all that money\nWhy does Neal five ten Fifteen houses wandering the on the part of a complex where's all the money\nSee this is the thing no matter what you do you think you're going to get ahead because you have a good job at better job with the best job or an incredible job it's still a job and you earn and you spend in you earn and you spend your earnings bending you're not building any wealth\nYou're not getting anywhere in society and yet you think the world is wrong because they chew you up and spit you out\nThat's because technology will always change if you were a guy that made saddles two hundred years ago you probably had a pretty good business or really a pretty good job\nYou either have to change with it\nOr you have to get out of line of change\nI'm an advocate you through this show today that you can do one or the other you can either change with it or you can step out advocate away from it by just becoming financially free and not have to worry about where society goes both of those items work\nSo it goes on and says that was until social media became popular and now people can share their ideas on line and without needing a programmer or hire a cheap one which I predict would happen some day in the future so I got out of this business so he ran again\nAgain it wasn't a business it was a job\nI change jobs again I'm a something for nothing instantaneously gravitationally diseased\nGuy that likes to hop from job to job to job or basically type a personality to not be so brutal does you know what uh type a personality is it somebody who will throw mud on the wall and hope something sticks he changes his mind or her mind\nOver and over and over again they start a thousand projects finish none of them right these are the typical Taipei People\nThat are they're just always looking for a way to make a fast buck there's no investment in the future in this type of mentality none what has he done to invest in his future and why should he deserve do not have to work hard for the rest of his life he's done nothing to change that outlook\nGoes on and says I figure I Need to have the skill where I Do not have to compete with the whole world that is high demand\nTo think about that shape I now for the year I Need a skill that I don't have to compete\nWhile\nIs that not complete and total giving up\nI mean that's just I give up I needed skilled is so low that no human being would want it there's no competition for this job right and so because there's no competition for the job to job is so terrible\nThat I'll be saving right\nSo what did you do says I became a truck driver which I'm currently doing it love it except now I hear about how they're making driverless cars in semis which I'm sure we'll workplace our job one\nDay yeah one day they will and when they do you'll still be broke you'll see still be looking for another job and you know\nUntil they make guys clean toilets there's going to be a lot of janitorial jobs around maybe they'll make a robotic limbs till Sunday then you lose that job too but what have you done to invest in the future and by the way why does he like driving a truck I've driven trucks before mass of solitude\nNo competition no argumentation nobody to deal with\nYou just sit there by yourself in total solitude don't have to interact with the world boy nice job great job do you make any money you know we have a future know what happens when you can't drive anymore yes you'll be out of work and broke\nIt goes on and says here's the reason for this email I hear you on the radio recently stating that you are expanding nationwide and opening up new officers in other states that's a good thing for your business since you're already successful and say that you have more money than you will ever need\nI just wonder if you grow so large and add thousands of do preferred members that your second deal\nThat the second a deal comes available it will be gone within two seconds due to so many people doing going after it\nWell my friend that's already true\nDeals don't last when there was an opportunity to make a hundred percent return it doesn't matter if we had ten people or ten thousand\nThose are going to be sucked up right but the reality is that what you're talking about is you're talking about the abundance mentality or lack there of you believe in the zero sum game reality of the world you believe\nFor me to have a dollar I have to take it from you for you to have a dollar you have to take it from somebody else and that there's not enough dollars to go round the simply isn't true\nAnd I'm a cover it after I finish repair wrap your says or worse a multibillion dollar company will see what you are doing and duplicate your business models that millions of advertising worldwide to point to the point where no houses or apartments will be available as investments since they will be bought before you can even see it\nAll let me tell you a little secret no one's going to duplicate this business because lifestyles does something that no corporate America company could ever duplicate it gives back it has the abundance mentality and believes it doesn't have to have all of the business\nIt believes that can give it away to its customers lettuce customers become rich instead of it becoming rich in other words I could have been a Donald Trump I could have said I Want to own all this real so I could talk people investing in me I could own billions and billions of dollars of apartment complexes\nWith all the members I have but I was not interested in me being a billionaire I was interested in my members becoming millionaires and so instead of me taking all the millions and adding up to billions\nWe taught people's go out and earn the millions and we help them do that\nNo corporation in America can be founded on that kind of generosity it's impossible no company could ever survived that business model except my why because I've already rich before I started in ... I'm not greedy and you just won't find that many people that way right\nMost people go to work because they want to make money that you you go to work every day because you want to make money\nI go to work every day because I Want to help people and I don't go to work every day that's the beauty of it I own a business that is out there I go to work on the radio one hour a day I go to work\nA once a month or two a two day just so I stay involved in my members and know that the message is still tight ... so you take another corporation is going to allow somebody to do that I don't think so and so your premises wrong from there but it's even more wrong in another way which I'm going to cover when we come back\nFrom this next break because that lack mentality lack mentality that you're carrying\nWe have housing now with the vapors Asian guess what I'm going to invest in vapors Asian right but until\nThen housing has been around forever and probably will be around for a lot longer okay so here it is the guy saying do you could steal all the deals no I couldn't steal all the deals because if I didn't have a group of like minded people we wouldn't have enough money to go out and do all the deals\nNow the next point he's making is once we teach all these people all over the world how to do this there is not going to be enough deals now here's a reality\nI've been doing this in Houston, Texas for Thirty years\nAnd we're still doing deals at a higher rate than we've ever done a map before so that part is why\nWe went to Dallas we've been doing it there for Fifteen Years still doing deals at a faster rate than ever before San Antonio Austin the same thing but now what you have to understand is for twenty six years in Houston I've had lifestyles\nWe still have even touched the market we put a dent in the microwave scratched the edge of the market\nBecause there's so many apartment complexes there's like three thousand apartment complexes in Houston three thousand dollars three thousand San Antonio and Austin and that's only just taxes\nThat's not counting middling\nNot counting the nine we own down in Corpus Christi et cetera et cetera so here's a point when we expand to a new area like Atlanta where we're going that whole city has Thirty Years' worth prospect of action for us\nWe haven't even begun it just like when they told us when we were high school when I was in high school the stupid idiots told us there was Twenty years of oil left\nTwenty years and that's it will be out of oil\nThat's the lack mentality now there's a hundred years of oil left in each of about five countries out there right in each of five and in fact there's probably a hundred years while in two or three states in this country just one state and yet\nWe still believe we have an oil now we believe that there's so many apartment complexes that if we signed up as many people's rehab in taxes in every other state union they're still being a business from to do that and that will be Ken lifetimes before that happens\nBut my point is is with all of that said without being true to disguise totally missed\nThe email my point you is how sad is it for him because here he is now thirty six years of age\nAnd here's what he believes it seems like the only secure jobs for those who are not already rich are the ones that take many years of sacrifice and credential such as being a doctor or lawyer would just something not everyone is willing to do about the demand\nWill always be high there it is the only thing you can get rich doing as being a doctor or lawyer a thing that which most of us are not willing to do or he just nailed it for himself ... hey\nI'm unhappy that are not rich I'm unhappy that I haven't been successful my whole life but I'm not willing to either go do something that would put me in the position that couldn't be ... or number to stick with anything and get better at it like\nI should have got better at electronics I should've got better at programming but I didn't I didn't I didn't I just kept running and now I'm a truck driver\nWow he goes on and said I just wanted to see if you could perhaps way my negative way of thinking about this since it's a very since it seems that every money making opportunity will eventually go way of the buggy whip [noise] think about it\nEvery money making opportunities he spoke of\nWas about work it was about labor\nIt was about doing something to somebody else doesn't want to do and it's that belief system which is killing them think about\nIt if you would have started investing when he was Twenty years old and real estate\nDoll houses that I bought twenty six years ago are still there\nPeople are still living and I don't know because I'm like this guy I progressed in my knowledge of my business\nSo I went from houses duplex is to four Plex his small apartments to medium size apartments to large apartment\nI progress much skill set knowledge base right now I'm trying to do class apartment I'm pushing myself to progress my skill set because I Know that the old stuff will eventually be old too old to using the new stuff I'll have to understand so I have to be on the cutting edge that's what a class a as you got to be in the cutting edge of the business\nBut this gentleman doesn't want to be on the cutting edge he doesn't want to do anything he wants to go backwards\nHe wants to trade time for money secondly he has no assets the businesses we don't have assets\nAs inflation occurs our assets go up and die as income goes up rents go up the acid value goes up\nWe keep growing he keeps having to pay more money his job income gets watered down by inflation our asset values get increased by inflation my friends this gentleman's life\nHas been lived behind the prism of the negativity a failure\nAnd we don't know if there's any possibility that you can never be saved he's asked for help and I took this email today live this morning and I'm given to it back alive today I Hope he's listening will take a short break we'll be right back to do on the radio show\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [laughter] [noise] [noise]\nAnd you're listening to the Joe ... radio she will
