time monthly fee\nWelcome back to do on the radio show today we're discussing a theory that I have that we have been educated out of success\nAnd that there is predicated on public education uh which was first started the industrial revolution and the reason was all of a sudden there was a high demand for semi skilled employees people who could follow directions and\nDo the same work every day and get it accurate you know and so they started as educational system to train employees do you think about what they trade you first of all the crazy to fill\nOut blank answers to questions if X then what happens why yes or no\nThere's no critical thinking in any of the educational process as reading writing arithmetic stuff that they you know deemed to be necessary science and math are wonderful things are great things and they make you more productive if you're going to go out and do the industrial revolution and produce things\nAnd they needed these people but what they need which critical thinking what they could have was selfishness they had to make you believe you had to follow instructions and said you remember when you were a kid\nBeing in those wives to go to the bathroom wind up in the hall why to recess\nWhen you get older they they did away with the lines but they still have the same mental approach to the bell rings ... dog everybody gets up and go to the next place everybody sits down there but we shuts up don't speak out of turn raise your hand and if you want his beak\nBlah blah blah blah blah nothing there\nNothing there about how do you stand out and be good\nTouchy things like don't cheat which in life is probably the best way to learn things as somebody sitting right next you knows how to do something you don't why don't you get the information from them right Henry Ford had a guy one time come in the interview 'em and the guy said you know I\nDon't know how you got to be so rich or not that smart and Henry Ford goes I don't need to be that smart he says I've got all these buttons on my desk in anything that I Need answered I can push a button and the guy who was the smartest in the world would come in here and the answer that\nQuestion about that topic and that's what I Would always learn they learn they don't have to know everything you don't have to take every class and learn every topic\nYou just have to learn how to get people that know how to do it to go to work for you in work for you to accomplish your goal and that's what these people were trained in two\nThere's an old saying somewhere I don't know what it is it\nSays it all the people who'd A's graduated with aids ended up being the scientists the doctors and the engineers all the guys to\nGraduate with seize end up being around sorry with bees ended up being the managers and in charge of the businesses but the people to grow up with seize end up being the owners of the businesses\nBecause they're not spending all their time focusing\nOn this idea that you've got to be able to replicate the same exact answer the same exact which it the same exact\nEverything over and over and over again blindly\nFollowing the plan and so they took that and they trained just to believe that our life was go to school will get a job save your money four one K.

I should be able to have it why don't I have it why can't I have it and what are you going to do to make it possible for me to have it\nIs the questions they ask instead of how can I saw but now I have many many teachers that are rich\nThey're financially successful because they thought outside of the box that you know what if I'm going to make teaching my life which is you know value\nThing to do I've got many educators in my family aunts\nUncles actually two uncles ranch we're both professors\nTeachers administrators it's a balancing to do but they realized\nSo we've got people in the house or sixty two we got people that are fifty we got a bunch of kids that are under thirty five hundred and thirty four and then we got grandkids\nAnd it's so interesting to see how each generation believes more and more and more so they deserve everything the\nBabies the kids scream and yell if they don't get their way and you know that's how they're going to grow up you know that society they're growing into in the parents are ...\nThey know no better because they've been taught punishing your kid is bad you go to jail for spanking your kids you can't you know punish kids anymore you know it takes a village to raise a kid you can't do it by yourself blah blah blah blah blah you're creating disaster within your own family guys\nThese people solve the problem by either getting invested in real she now think about this one is ten years ago when they decided they wanted to be teachers or Twenty years ago when this I didn't want to be teachers they bought a couple of rent houses\nWell those run houses would have gone from being worth a hundred and eighty thousand which they were ten years ago to six hundred and fifty thousand which they are now and they'd be multimillionaires\nAll they would have had done was realized if I'm going to be a teacher and I don't want to be poor I've got to create streams of income period but they didn't and so now they can't make it\nSo now this guy writes is creepy article just move on the next article the other one somebody sent me or actually I lifted up from that same articles call from that watch group again and what is saying is financial stability doesn't miss necessarily mean having a high income\nAnd he goes on and says young Americans have struggled so much in recent years that they may not even know what being financially sound looks like\nA commentator popular social networking site Reddit asked following members what exactly just financially sound mean it just started working and I don't know if I'll ever reach that point shaving is no doubt harder with low income but even people aren't wealthy\nWorking and I don't know if I'll ever reach that point shaving is no doubt harder with low income but even people aren't wealthy young people in their twenties thirties can financially stable if they focus on saving rather than spending\nA said somebody pulling his notice [laughter] attorney from financial planner based in Washington DC for people who are receiving race or a bonus at work for instance she shrug saving half of it or more it would get you the habit of living less living on less\nUh then you make and you continue\nTo improve your financial situation or something like that goes on and says what are the three things you should ask yourself number one do I spend all my salary every month\nNumber to do I have six months worth of expenses in emergency savings fund and number three orders was number three in\nA ...\nOr do I have to have retirement saying he got cut off in the page do I have a retirement savings\nSo if you look at what they're asking do I spend every penny of what I make I came up with three questions you should ask yourself or you say the least twenty five to fifty percent of what you are they'll do that and say you can't do that okay look I got kids living right here\nThey lived with us up until they're in their late twenties in fact one of the kids still lives with her dad and she's in her late twenties you're living at home you have no bills\nRight\nYou have a job she has a job she makes good money and she sees quite a bit of it she got quite a bit of money saved up she doesn't want to admit it because she's embarrassed that none of our other friends have any money because they spend every dime they make\nWhen you were in that situation no matter where you are life you start somewhere where we have very little overhead if you don't raise your overhead that first paycheck gets a hundred percent more than what you had the day before you could start with a fifty percent savings plan right that\nEasily just like the guy saying if you get a raise that raises you don't have it right now you can save half of that race\nYou can only afford twenty five percent as you go out and buy assets and they start to increased income that's pass if it's on the outside of what you have right\nYou need none of that because you had none of it so every dime of what you earn passively should be saved so now you've got you're saving twenty five percent of your paycheck and every dime of what you make that we now have your total network you're saving closer to fifty percent\nWould that kind of ratio and with re investments you're going to be a millionaire and no time at all second question you ask yourself is how much passive income to that room last year how much more am I going to earn this year\nThe amount of passive income blows my mind when asked people okay everybody room please write down how much passive income you have
