[noise]\nI Love your back and now here's some more conventional wisdom to set you free the man on a mission to retire American one person at a time when\nI look back to do was a radio show or today we're talking about how to take on big projects\nLarge turnaround situations and I'm Talking about my personal residents and also about apartment complex which is closed and also about your personal finances so the first episode you have to go ahead get sit down and look at your plan\nYour financial plan\nIs wrong how do I know it's for\nWell was don't use the word wrong because Kobe doesn't like that are ... so that I'm right you're wrong that's bigger pointing that just to do it so it was talked about effective yours is not affected are you living off the bat so ah so your sister your plan doesn't work\nIt's ineffective when it does it give you what you want which is lots of money and lots of free time\nAnd so you got to look and see what's wrong and you got to analyze it so as I Would analyze my personal by the job situation I Would look for income coming in could that be increased money going out can decrease the expenses that are\nIn my life that are wasteful expenses that aren't going to look at when I get on the income side you know what is by net worth doing for me what is the money in my house or to me which is nothing what does the forward cable there have\nHurting me and it's paying me nothing for months by a race pygmy nothing what do I have my savings accounts earning a quarter percent or have reset nowadays or what is\nYeah and if it's going out the door fast and you can bring it in\nYour not going to save it so when I looked at my landscape situation [noise]\nMy first priority was okay\nWhat am I losing\nWhat do I need I Need to stop the bleeding what is the most important thing to fix first as I looked at my landscaping I realized that I was losing plants which is expensive to do in grass also because I wasn't getting enough water so I went around first thing I Do is I picked\nThe area of my life that I wanted to work on which was my front yard\nOf actually is a quarter tip of my odds of or small portion of my job yard\nAnd I took down I said I got to master this quarter right here\nAnd so I looked at the sprinkler systems I saw there was to sprinkle heads were broken so I took him out and put her new ones and solve that problem\nJak that also had an area that was flooded and so I turned the area that was flooded off completely\nAnd I put in low for water heads and said okay now when I turned his back on the area that's dry I'm going to put on higher for water heads so it gets more water in those areas 'cause obviously those areas needed it over here where it's a very tight area and there's too many heads I'm going to put on low flow has slowed down\nThinking I had it all solved dry then I picked up the next thing you did you if you're out there looking at your finances you got to say OK I'm start working on this one was white do to fix that when\nYou ... what YouTube has out there for you to see what lifestyles has over here for you the information in life to become successful in whatever endeavor you're out to attack is out there somewhere get your hands so I'm Googling this stuff is spending hours sitting up at night watching these videos and stuff\nOn what's going wrong and what are they just made it very obvious that I have not been feeding my grass in years past I fertilized my grass on a regular basis now because I broke my foot that it broke my ankle\nA tuition my knee ... broke my elbow tore my price up off the last six months I haven't been able to exercise at all which means there's no way I could get out there putting fertilizer and you can push the stupid cart and so\nI signed up their start fertilizing this thing up I started fertilizer luck put a little fertilize little we'd kill and all of a sudden things started getting a little green but in the healthy areas where had not crowded out\nIt was becoming beautiful thick wow winning they're over here in these areas it's it's not kidding me there yeah and then I took her and read an article in the guy said you need to fertilize more often and I'm thinking you can't fertilizing the heat of summer it's going to kill the grass he talked about how fertilized did not\nKill the grass in the heat of summer and talked about how to turn this thing around so I started fertilize it every week or just a little bit so that as that fertilizer got water did\nAnd started take effect I could put a little new fresh fertilizer on their little new weed killer on there to kill some bleach and slowly but surely over the next two weeks you start to see a dramatic change in this part of the yard\nBut I still had the flooded out area I Fitch theories that we do dry never worked starting to come back with the flooded out area or didn't I couldn't seem to fix it even though I put a low flow heads it was still getting too much water so I analyze the situation when I realized was there was actually a golly\nNow there is a\nRegular storm golly that goes along the front of my yard and sides in my yard she goes to a creek you know runs out its natural but even within that golly there was a low area so low\nThat the water would just sit there couldn't get out of that area to go and follow the natural trading trial\nThat the water would just sit there couldn't get out of that area to go and follow the natural trade ...\nAnd\nI thought about you you don't want to do instead of worrying about how to dig deeper I was going to dig deeper ditches and with the deeper ditches that maybe I could change the flow of water and get it away from that area and I thought you know it'd be easier to that want to just fill the whole thing\nAnd so that's the next step to them and tries to go ahead and solve the problem but the whole it and the point I'm making is\nAs you start to look at your situation financially we sit down with your work or with you on these things sometimes been to dig a little sometimes are going to fill sometimes we have to fix things with a twist to the right sometimes with the tourists to laugh\nBut we're taking just one part so for looking at your four one K. was or what can we do to make it forward cable profitable for you we have a lot of things to work out there and we all have a lot of possibilities we can do with that money both inside the forward care outside the four one K. they'll make a major difference\nBut we've got to take that four one K. apart mentally\nTo get to the point where it's actually going to make some difference and if we don't do that they were not going to be able to solve the problem is the problem is going to be solved simply by\nDoing more of what does that work together words contributing more isn't going to make it happen that we're feeding the four one K.\nYou can actually overfeed something a lot of people putting money into the four one K. makes no sense at all because they're putting in more than what the matches\nDoesn't make any sense to do that 'cause world case a retarded investment to start with\nYes I said it retarded it's ridiculously stupid thing to do but if you're going to do it doing more of it is worse than doing less of it\nSo as we go through these battles each and every day would tear your four one K. situation of part would tear your personal residents\nSituation part bull terrier earned income situation apart will look at your not exist as password income situation see where we can build some ... et cetera et cetera will look at your expense is your home expenses where are you wasting money you can save it start saving money so you can invest more\nAll of these different topics are part of working this process\nSo it's not just okay I'm going to go buy a red house and have some passage of that is going to be a part of the process but that is not the entire process that is a part of the solution but there's no way the process\nThe problem is you don't know how 'bout you turn it either direction the wise thing to do is to start out\nAnd start moving slowly but surely not crank it all the way up and get now\nYou generally crank it all the way up to if you got to really drive all you want to make sure gets enough water to try to come back but you can't leave it there you got to crank it back down again because\nOnce you've got it growing and saturated now you're going to get it\nOr you know ... keep it so whether you're going to get more and so and so forth so it's a it's a balancing act I got to stay on top of but we are talking about this just one zone in my house so I now\nI'm working my way out of that so right so you're working your way out of okay what are we going to do with this extra card to test your car payment we don't need what are we going to do with the you know we've got four hundred stations or cable we always watch the same ten stations every single\nTime um you know do we really need all that are just all the stuff in your life you're wasting money it's just a waste that you don't really need to do [noise] um\nAre you going out to eat too often you know sound too little bit towards like Dave Ramsey but the bottom line is there is an expense sides of the equation now when I got back to my yard here\nAfter I had stabilize\nThis front area I had to let it sit for a couple of days a week or two and see what it would turn into I had to let the fertilizer take effect\nI had to let the change of lawn chair companies take effect\nHas a ... like the change of a rotator heads on the sprinkler systems take effect um so I sat that went off the side as sort of watch it I made it a point every day to go out and watch it look what's happened to see what's going on and then it went on to my next his own\nAnd the next so it was truly a watery problems that the heads sprinkler has one of them was buried underneath the plant there's growing like a hundred times the size of originally planted is with the sprinkler once I was on the edge of bad are now it's you know ...\nSix feet under a plan so I had to trim the plant a waste of the regular to get to the area or that was dead and another area that was dead because the sprinkler it had a was not adjustable\nFrom the plant away so to speak with you get to the area a that was dead and another area that was dead because the sprinkler had a was not adjustable heads it wasn't hitting the area effectively a bit the head couldn't be adjusted so that has to be replaced or your two or three of those\nOut there with their heads and thirdly it was a gigantic area with three hundred and sixty degree rotary heads\nAnd they take a long time to get all the way round so you either got to leave the water running for a long time\nFortunate for rotary three sixty road we had to get everything or you've got to increase the flow water out of the rotary had well I Can't leave is running longer because they're in that same set of zoned there are a bunch of heads it only go a hundred and eighty degrees\nAnd so if you set it to quit your lawn slots at a hundred and eighty degrees and not over water the hundred and eighty degree once you end up under water in\nThe three sixties so now I have to go back out and take the three sixty heads off and put more water on them so I can cut the whole thing backed out so I don't have the swamp in one area in a drier and these are things that\nCould not have been known when the program the process originally designed or maybe they could it but they were just you know they just took the short cut and just did it the easy way but the bottom line is here I Am seven years later and I've never ... took the time to figure this out because it wasn't until I lost control of my yard stopped fertilize my\nThat I got to the point where I could actually see\nHow wrong in these situations worsening my point you is\nHow far does your finances have to go wrong before you wake up\nAnd say I need a new plan this one isn't working it's just not working\nHow long before you realize you have no positivity and you\nWere to move on to that you know we went to the back yard and\nWhere we had planted took out all the tropical supplanted all these Hedges to get this what we call the English garden effect foxwoods everywhere\nAnd we'd feel some of those ... owns with roses and they drift roses which was short little roses and look beautiful with others owns we put in and uh angels and and when we put the angels and they were beautiful but come back around this year again\nAnd all those angels are dead\nNow we've gone through this three years but now I don't have a landscaping company so for two months of bed sit there and there's nothing in the beds so finally we saw ready to go put some stuff in the ... right\nWell we found out was were the heat of the summer anything you plant now will die by September all new plants that will survive the winter come in September and our plan in September and October so\nWe had to realize there is a timing to fixing certain things in your life\nThere is a timing in your life when you can get your money out of your four one K. effectively or more effectively or less effectively there's a timing when you can retire there's timing issue with when you and how you pay your bills and so on and so forth\nAnd so we had to get involved with the timing issue the other thing we had to do was stop\nThe bleeding so we took a very large portions of these bettered areas and just put in Rose's again beautiful small short drift roses to fill them just makes it look beautiful but you don't have to do anything with their their\nSummer and winter\nYou're done so I started putting plants in solve the problem I'm done with those areas other than reading in fertilizing and that's something you got to keep in mind the expense of owning things never goes away there's always going to be waiting in fertilizing so we get back to this\nThe expense of owning things never goes away there's always going to be with union fertilize so we get back to the pools ... beds and now we're investing this up now were bugs that red house by buying these players and putting these players in that will die that was the year after year after year\nI'm getting the return from those players beauty\nWithout the annual cost and maintenance management to the to putting the new budget every single year\nI'm solving my long term problems by investing in something that will pay dividends for years that's what you
