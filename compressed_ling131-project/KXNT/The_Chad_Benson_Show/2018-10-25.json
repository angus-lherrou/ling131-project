talking about your personal growth argue growing are you doing anything about it or are you coming home at night after living this lab require desperation coming home at night and just how it in yourself\nTurning your light bulb off at night watching TV becoming brain dead you realize when you get off of work with every time you get off by the time you get home and you eat dinner there still three or four or five hours left at night you can get something done\nI Would suggest either what you need to do is you need to start thinking about investing in yourself\nBefore you start investing money out here we're going to talk about the best in money today to do give wrong we're going to get to that but before you spend any time going out there investing money I think you need to invest money in education for yourself\nWhat types of education I think you need to know so but at the kitchen a motivation\nYou know where do you want to be in life what do you want to be in life where you go in your life you know you hear this over and over and over again but like I said until I got up your goals that okay look I'm already where I Want to be that's a very easy thing to say\nI Am a piece of garbage middle class human beings I have a decent job I have a decent uh I have a decent home I have a decent this kid's blah blah blah I was listening to a park yes you today\nAnd his definition is the explanation was pretty interesting you said you know poor people are all about me me me and uh that's about as selfish is going to be what can I earn what is my paycheck\nWhere do I live what do I drive however my kids what grades to my kids yet he said if you've ever heard any more sickening and cry baby ... self centered is that instead of what can I Do to improve the world\nWhat can I Do to grow my resources to where I have enough to give away and he's talking about rich people are way\nWay way\nNicer than poor people now that is so different than what you believe but I'll tell you this if you go to a poor person's house and you meet their kids and their family and the wife and husband you'll find that the husband and wife don't share their financial information sometimes even with each other\nAlmost always not with their kids their kids learn nothing about finances because the parents won't talk about him because the parents are embarrassed about what they're doing with their money\nThey are not growing a family legacy they are piling a little bit of money into an account hoping that some day we'll get them by and the darkest moments of their life to survive\nThey are planning for mere survival they're already living a life of quiet desperation now they're planning for a life of mere survival where is the abundance in that\nPoint of view can you share that with me where is there something about\nWow my family is going to have a wonderful life because I Want them because I Want to go and have the ability to help my church I Want to have the ability to help other people like it lifestyles at thirty five thousand clients\nMany many many of which you've already retired hundreds maybe thousands of them have retired uh how many people more can I help how can I make help quicker faster better\nThose are the kinds of things that millionaires get up and think about how can we do more faster and better for those people out there\nNo worry about ... comes back to me because it's gonna come back to me\nIf I put enough out there in the universe the universe is going to bring enough back to me if you do right now have enough going on in your life to make you where do you want to be if you're not where you want to be you're not putting enough out their guys you're not out there putting it out making it happen

complex hundreds of people are they happy there have you influenced their happiness are you out there producing happiness in the world\nSo that you can return receive your uh bonded return\nOr are you sitting on the couch watching and being pissed off at Nancy Pelosi which is a complete idiot or any other one of the\nOr are you sitting on the couch watching and being pissed off at Nancy Pelosi which is a complete idiot or any other one of the mill is hundreds of politicians you could just look at right now you could go down to listen go idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot idiot I don't know how we elect people\nI think we go the dumber they are the better chance of them getting elected but what's worse is not only do you you're lucky to sit and listen to 'em like they actually know something those guys no nothing they will not help you or your family get where you want to be\nThere out there to stop you from getting where you want to be that's what government the U.S government does it help you it stops you it takes away from you steal from you it doesn't help you in any way shape or form\nGovernment by pure nature is something that has to suck\nIn not give out right\nSo why do you spend all your time paying attention to these idiots it doesn't make any sense right so what should you pay your attention to you should be paying your attention to those things which will help to expand the universe\nAnd return those positive will bring back to you and your family to do that you have coming to you from putting out all these positive things in the world\nBut you can't do that if you go home at night and shell out in front of the TV you can't go home at night a jazz crashed yourself down with alcohol like I was doing for a couple of years it doesn't work there's no way you're at the er the second you pick up the bottle and started drinking it's done for the day\nPeriod you're over I Know I did it and\nYou would ask me well why don't you stop all my defense was I don't want us to see I could admit to myself as a millionaire it was actually a multi millionaire I'm not going to call myself a mega multimillionaire but multibillion earn access up\nI was very happy with their bodies coming in businesses are working everything's operating and say well why can't I sixty to just sit back and relax and the answer is not really sitting back and relaxing what I'm doing is pickling myself\nRich people do do that rich people don't have pockets I don't have pockets of money I have cash thirty right\nThirty million in cash that can be spent we're I Need to invest it to make the money I Need\nI don't have it in buckets\nIt may be in probably about thirty or forty different accounts because I've got it spread out so that there's insurance FDIC insurance on but the bottom line is it's their edits waiting for the next big deal\nI don't want it there I wanted a deal I Want to buy more income so let's take a look I can take I'm going out and buy an apartment complex right now I can take a part of that money and that money right there\nProbably are as me somewhere around three hundred thousand dollars a year in income that'd be one percent I'm actually only two percent of most of my savings account but so let's say I make three hundred four hundred thousand a year in interest eagle boy that's incredible I could live off that the rest of all I\nKnow that's terrible the rate of return on that investment is terrible now I go out and buy an apartment complex\nThe process of buying one right now when I buy that apartment itself cost me nine or ten million dollars which I'm not expecting you to understand is just take the zeros off of all this discussion and it will make me between nine hundred and a million dollars a year\nNow what's interesting about that is it will make it for me in tax free income\nIn addition to that I mean it's about fifty thousand dollars a month\nIn income if you look at it that way but not counting the other auxiliary or ancillary type incomes that makes up a bit about fifty grand a month which would be somewhere around see fifty times twelve a six hundred thousand dollars but it's paying down the mortgage\nAnother two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year now what's interesting is the depreciation on this which is the ability to earn income without paying taxes on it\nAnother two hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year now what's interesting is the depreciation on this which is the ability to earn income without paying taxes on is somewhere around a million dollars nine hundred and some thousand dollars so all that incomes going to be tax free\nRight\nAnd in addition to that because of the new tax laws that Trump past I'll probably get another two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of deductions right out of the blocks the right up against my other incomes and other things\nSo you think about this I'm going from let's say nine hundred thousand dollars or any one percent is nine what would that be Ninety thousand a year or two percent a hundred and eighty thousand you're going from a hundred and eighty thousand a year\nTo almost a million a year in income the hundred and eighty thousand would have been taxed\nAnd the million a year it's tax free you know what I'm Trump doesn't really shows tax returns 'cause he make billions tax free you my friend every time you put into that a savings account you're paying income tax on that or if you're putting it into four one K. and you're a you're not paying taxes this year\nBut somewhere along the line when you take it out you got to pay taxes on\nWe are going to avoid taxation both when we are in it and then later when we sell the property we're going to ten thirty one that forward and get out of paying it at that point also so you see what you're looking at here is the ability to earn ten times as much income\nAnd earned it with no taxation so you look at a family and they say we're\nShould your money ...\nShould your money be at some places you know when you find that Japan is if we can draw down four percent a year and we won't run your money out until you're eight years old nine years old me the really only earning two percent a year and then they're drawing down in the principal and the other two percent\nBut what did you could earn ten percent now I'm not even throwing in there all the other ways we income for example when we buy properties many times we buy them in a distressed situation and we go in and we fix them up and we have immediate income from that we call that force\nAppreciation force appreciation is massive if it's\nWrapped around the rule the ten twenty five one hundred rule a ten percent increase in income because of the improvement of the property critic twenty five percent increase in value since we only have twenty five percent down payment or equities only twenty five percent that twenty five percent increase in value means we have a hundred percent\nGain on our investing a hundred percent gain on your desk and can you imagine if you can increase your income or your investment network by a hundred percent of your\nHouse that's unbelievable\nWe also had that thing we're thing called appreciation you know rent just keep going up values just keep going up we're getting all that while you're money sitting\nThere and it's the inflation is depreciating your money we have the tax advantage of depreciation\nAnd the other one is when we produce these massive cash or capital gains we can refinance and pull that money on tax free tax free do understand that so we can pull out hundred two hundred and five hundred million dollars and pay no taxes on it whatsoever\nYou're not doing that\nAre living a life of quiet desperation mediocre life and you're living\nYou're not doing that you are living the life of quiet desperation mediocre like that you're living by a set of rules are going to keep you there\nThe reason you're stuck there\nIs because you are not make yourself out at whatever level you're living at right now whatever it is you get up today and said I Am me I Am proud to be\nWhat I'm saying is
