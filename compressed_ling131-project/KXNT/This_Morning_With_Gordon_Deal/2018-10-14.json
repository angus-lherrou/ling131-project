do what you want there never coming back to Colorado again because you know it's too high of an altitude\nSorry about that just do what you want and I said All right thank you very much so I put an ad in the paper and I had the biggest state so I don't think anybody's ever seen anything like wow I hired\nTwenty people um to help me out and we all had T shirts that said on a ledge estate sell Nineteen Ninety nine and it was ethic\nMy goodness you do things so loud literally\nEverything in the house lock stock and barrel you can see where this is going right [laughter] I Can't wait\nTill the ghost of surely actually sue was not happy with me I'm not long after that my nephew was living with me and he was only six years old at the time and he actually had his own bedroom at the on a ledge estate and he started talking about a goes named sue\nOh [laughter] I thought it was just so precious that he had this imaginary friend I had an imaginary\nFriend when I was a child too and I didn't think much about it we'll see started telling him what to do like oh in the beginning it was really sweet like oh sue made me eat those cookies that you told me not to eat and I'd\nBe ... to\nYou know innocent but then\nI I I have to catch my breath because it really bothers me to even recall this story it is so hunting and chilling that my nephew begged me not to tell this story so when I wrote about it and my first book haunted managing springs I changed the name\nOf the people and how old is your nephew epigenetics at this time next Wednesday\nNights in the middle of the night he came into our bedroom crying\nAnd he was covered\nIn scratch marks\nAnd he was bleeding okay he was leading and it looked like he had been bitten all over his body and I pulled off his shirt\nAnd he was bruised and he was crying and he was so scared and I said what has happened to you and he had since his in his hands and I ran down to his room and he had to cut the ear off of our cat and he said that still made him do it oh dear\nYou said stew I'm Sorry he kept\nCalling it stew this goes through it wasn't sue I'm Sorry it was too well it was after about two or three months my nephew had his speech and pet him and and really what he was saying was soon he was saying sue and that was the former owners name the one that died\nNow the one that did not like me anymore right for and before oh it was awful he said to me stupid doesn't want you any here anymore\nAnd then how would you do did you\nOh my gosh I was so frightened you and I just I mean even to recall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\n... we had to\nRecall it and like I said my nephew doesn't even like me to tell that story um it it was\nThe ... we had to I we had no choice right had no choice oh what did you do that\nOh we had no choice and then if it's if it's to make matters even worse is like I told you I was having these um haunted wine and cheese parties\nAnd like I said in the beginning I just thought it was fun it was like oh that silly stew\nHe stole something again you know and I might find oh my eyeglasses in the freezer or or they might be missing completely for a week and then I might find them outside in the driveway it was just kind of ... and the beginning and and and fairly innocent\nBut what I really think happened was not only did we have the ghost of the former owner there but um because see remember it was hunted before we bought it supposedly\nSeveral owners or several people wins or menus I'm just going to say\nThat what what we ended up finding out was that it was it that sign up for it all it is it's the stream we strongly haunted still\nAnd you are still living there no ... no\nAfter five years we did get out we got out and the day that we left the day that we decided we had to leave every single doorbell and the house was going off with was a four story home and we had doorbell is on every level\nAnd we took the doorbell out that the batteries\nOut of the doorbell on the first level and then the second leveling off we took those batteries out the third level went off it it felt like they were driving us crazy\nLike driving you out would happen celebrating what came of the place where it wouldn't have been doing\nWell actually after we sold it then the Maddox family bought it and this was in two thousand five and they just sold it about two years ago but wildly owned it in two thousand fourteen\nOn a ledge was voted number six on the nation's top ten most haunted places just behind the lazy boarding house\nBy USA Today and the Huffington Post who would buy something like that ah it actually you know what ... talking about\nHow about true beauty what happened with this house is that it was actually bought by someone who turned it into a Buddhist\nA Buddhist retreat and it's wonderful because last I heard is that they cleared all the spirits away and that the house is happy again so\nI Am really glad that I Would take a lot of work but they have done so much work than men with ... experts and they uh they change the gardening they change the direction of certain\nYou know that really works\nIt apparently it worked because it's it's it's free\n[laughter] fascinating for about a hundred\nYears yeah it was tremendously haunted and then later\nAfter you know let me being a historian and everything I Want to know why the house was so haunted [noise] and\nI won't get into that right now I did find out that there was a reason there always is any time something tragic\nOr horrible happens it leaves a psychic in in print or bruises if you will that can be felt by some people and I'm One of those people unfortunately\nWell at least you know that about yourself some people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives\nAnd people may feel it and not know how to interpret those feelings or interpret things that are happening in their lives and\nThis is so interesting that you should bring this up because I'm actually my children's stepmother um their mother died of cancer when they were one and three years old\nAnd so um they're both very smart people on both of them there have their doctorates degree my son interesting enough um is a doctor at Stanford right now and he was the only one in our family who never saw a ghost when we were living it on a ledge or experience something paranormal\nAnd I really believe it was because he just didn't want to do [laughter] you\nKnow he had an analytical mind do you want to become a doctor and he\nTotally turned it out so all these years I think he you know he always thought that I was a little bit crazy until\nI knew I wanted to know what he does is friends do ya my mom's go turn [laughter] and ah\nIt it's it's it's a it's it's kind of sweet being validated finally [laughter] oh it has ... did you\nOh yeah he believes me now he knows I'm good storyteller anyway\n[laughter] well that's that's what it's all about everything's about storytelling so now you still live in manner to springs right Joes little the history of that area\nWell this I Believe this is one this is the most taunted I call it the hunted heart of the Rockies and I'm not alone\nI'm sure you've heard of Nicholas ... right yeah oh well this was his home base he used to hang out here all the time because we have a lot of lightning here\nYou know where we live in the Rockies ... and I'm so he actually built a lab on the top of pikes peak the man he was fascinated with manages springs especially because we had some very curious magnetic\nAnomalies in our town I can actually walk with my compass around the perimeter of manatees springs on these beautiful hiking trails that we have and my how this will shake my hand and never find true north I kid you not\nThe the Indian American Native Americans knew about these\nSacred places and in the sacred places the trees actually grow kind of sideways and it's just curious ... the hair on my back on my arms and my neck will go up and um you can feel it um and the other thing that's curious about it is that\nBecause of these magnetic anomalies um Nicholas Tesla actually noticed I Believe he was standing outside of the cliff house hotel and he was watching as these birds um we're just\nCircling over managing springs like they didn't have any sense of direction\nLike their innate sense of ability to find their way through north or south was gone and you know they have birds have a little piece of hepatitis crystal and their brain and it they he was saying he was speculating that maybe because of these magnetic anomalies at the Brits were\nHunting confused because they were actually behaving in a very strange manner by like diving into buildings and in like ... the pilots [laughter] interesting\n[noise] [noise]\nOh welcome back to coast to coast am I guess is Stephanie waters and she is not only a professional storyteller as we can tell but he's also the owner of the blue moon hunted histories tours in Colorado\nSo Stephanie tell us a little bit more about you when we were talking about men or two springs and how it has this incredible magnetic anomaly there wherever else in Colorado and why specifically Colorado did it just ... do you\nUm\nThink another reason why I'm that people were drawn to manage his springs for spiritual reasons is because originally this was a sanctuary\nTo five warring Native American tribes and when they came here they had to pack between them that they would not\nFight them and they were here this was their holy sanctuary so they would wipe off their war paint and put down their weapons and there was peace here forever until the Victorians came along and the legend is that we started building you know the hotels and\nWhat have you ride over their natural minerals springs that was sacred to them and that the natives actually curse the town after that and that's why it's so hot that\nMake sense to me [laughter] yeah it does yeah it does now you live there I Do ... and you like it [laughter] but\nI had so haunted makes sense to me\nYeah just yeah it does now you live there\nI Do ... and you might get you\nBut you know what you have to be careful if you live here\nI Am not kidding you I'm I'll tell you what happened okay a year ago it was September eleventh I was taking a beautiful morning walk up the trail and I ran into a dead body hanging from the bridge\nNow this for your own body it was awful he's and he was suicide um come to find out it was a homeless person and it was awful but you know it rocked my world and I started talking to people here in this town about what is wrong with people here there is a\nHigh incidence of drug abuse and alcoholism and I believe it's because the people here have not learned how to um\nProcess and they they don't know how to channel the energy of managed to that is the legend that that's why there is so there are so many um artists dancers singers musicians that live in this town because they can feel the energy but if you don't properly channel this energy\nFor the powers of good [laughter] if you actually get into a negative mind spot or you don't create because if you're an artist and you live here you have to create and if you don't ... it will turn against you it will become a negative force and I know that because it happened to me when I first moved\nHere and I see it happening to other people would I've worn them\nMy a godsend moved in with me a year ago and I said I was trying to help them out he was gone through a hard time and I have this beautiful addict apartment two bedrooms and a kitchen and bathroom and I said he could live there for free just needed to get a job he was only here for a week and he you know the the spirit of mandatory Wilber took him and he goes I can\nFeel it I can feel it I've never felt so good in my life [laughter] you know [laughter] I said well you got to be careful well he burned out and about a month and [laughter] and it was really sad\nHow do you suggest people process that energy wherever they live if it's a haunted house or if it's a a relative how do you channel that energy\nWell I definitely don't want to be around in a negative energy anymore like I said I I Try to keep you know a healthy attitude about it if if I can call it\nBad [laughter] because you have to think about this why is it goes here why are they lingering that can't be good [laughter] because there is on his own business right well yeah but I mean that's that's that's a lot of anger too if you think about it and\nUm what do you say that I guess you would have to have\nA lot of anger to beat it to be tethered here\nUm if you are full of light and full of love and full of Christ consciousness whatever you want to call it I don't think you'd be tethered here after life I think that you would want to move on and toward the life um\nYou know you got a good point there do these beings one just each other here to hunter disrupt people because they have a grudge\nWell some of them I Believe our conscious and some of them I don't think that they know that they are here still but they're they're all troubled I you know I Love these stories when people go to bed and breakfast is haunted but only by a friendly spirit I'm like give me a great\nThere are no such thing as a friendly those Casper or otherwise\n[laughter] will because it why would they why would they state that's a good point\nIt's trawling it's going in and when you sit around with this okay ... did it it can it can lead you down a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean I don't want it\nIs this okay did it it can it can lead you down a dark road okay I've seen it happen to my friends I mean I don't watch TV and I haven't for Twenty years and it's funny that I'm In this business because now all these goes hunting shows or on TV [noise]\nUm and I guess in the last year or two you hear all these stories about these people that are on these goes hunting shows and they kill each other and that you heard about this stuff I think they get involved into a dark force you know it's nothing to play around with\nOur own goes troubled an online\nThat I Believe so I think that everyone has a different opinion now I Want to tell you something this last book that I just wrote was actually written because of a ghost\nI was called on the telephone to write a story to help this poor person who has been demonized for the last hundred years I helped her crossover by\nWriting this last book\nAnd I have that that is a matter of fact is that been forgotten jails and Conan\nBoth legends allure of the Rockies by ship for and it just came out and the very first story is true I Swear\nTo God Knows about it [laughter] pardon jealous about it okay\nAbout it it actually begins in Nineteen eighty five I was a college student and I decided to go to this little mining town to um interview the owners of this old theater and I'm not going to mention the theater 'cause I Want people to buy my book [laughter]\nAnyway they go to I go to the theater and I have an amazing paranormal experience where I actually saw the former owner of the theater and she was crying and she was upset because her name had been painted\nWell I didn't know what to do when I got back to school I'm not going to write this story they are going to think I'm not ... ... did not tell this story to anyone you know I've been single since I was a little kid so some times just put it out in my mind and don't tell anyone [noise]\nOkay so now flash forward to thousands sixteen I had written for books on got goes legends lord of the Rocky Mountains and live quite happy to rest on my little Rory laurels and I ... out of the blue got a telephone call\nFrom the Colorado alarm company about an intrusion signal\nOn Harrison Avenue and those historians out there might know where that is but only a historian with no where that was\nAnd that being said this was a message left on my home number now I was getting ready to take a walk I heard the phone rang and I was like I'm not going to get it but something told me to get it so five minutes later I went and checked the phone and I'm like oh my gosh this is an intrusion signal at the at the\nThis place you know over the mountains and I'm like why they call me I'm three hours a day\nAnd furthermore I mean only I Would know where this place is because I'm a historian I mean this was really weird not even the same area code or anything so I called the Colorado alarm can be right back and said why in the devil are you calling me is your check number I don't even have the same area code as as this place\nAnd it was a myth that answered the phone and it was a woman's voice on my answering machine and the man said I don't know what you're talking about lady and I gave him my phone number and he goes we didn't call your house and I said I got it on my answering machine he goes I don't know what you're talking about you're going to have to take this up with the theatre\n[laughter] call the police department and I said you know your alarms going off at the theater and they go yeah yeah we're on our way [laughter] really next morning I called the mayor of ... a discount on what's the name I called the mayor\nI'm going off at the theater and they go yeah I got were on our way [laughter] really next morning I\nCalled the mayor of ... of this town almost had been him I called the mayor I called the theater\nI felt everybody could nobody could give me an answer\nNow did you do have that voice on your\nSide let everybody listen to the first person I called was one of my dear friends dory spent my business partner she is a psychic she's been on good morning America she's pretty well known and I call up and I said don't let the devil is going on with this and she listens to the the tapes and you know on my tape recorder on my answering machine I let her listen to it\nAnd she went into a trance and she did a reading and she we found out that I had the same birthday as the former owner of this I'm old theater\nAnd a lot more in common that was just mind ... and my friend said to me you were destined to write a story about this crying goes because he is very sad that she has been demon all these all these years and no one has hurt her side\nOf the story and she wants you to correct it for her\n[laughter] you're kidding me and I said she goes no no I'm not kidding you so I called I called the um\nThe manager of this theater and I told her all of this I go I Know you're going to be ...

really kind of tense conversations with some of their colleagues we have examples in this piece of the people going to their bosses confided in them about really\nPersonal experiences of sexual assault um one CEO how to tell his employees to tone it down the ... the amount of political debates we're getting too heated so of a broad spectrum but just showing that this was something that really couldn't be avoided at work\nWitness I I mean it did it caused enough friction where somebody might want to quit or pushing and shoving or yelling\nWell we heard a talk to one person for example she works at a a distribution center in New Jersey and she said she really had to hold her tone\nAs a group of men in front of her work locking into work and trying to kind of really get into this and she felt she just did not want to engage so I think some people had to try to were suddenly redirect conversations hold their tongue not engage because they just knew\nThat they didn't want

stands in New York City it's been quite the evolution here's this weekend's Jennifer ...\nWhat can you buy at a newsstand well a lot more the news and get out of the wall Street Journal joins us now is more on how old fashioned newsstands are becoming snack destinations and is anyone buying paper newspapers or magazines\nThat typical now than they might be about five to ten acres that day so it sounds fine them but not very many people and this is down from even you know ten years ago they might have several hundred papers and back in the fifties they might have felt thousand paper\nKinds of products have come in to take the place of newspapers and magazines\n[noise] I'm not saying and it's gonna rain what kind of thought that this column for me as I was in time\nI needed something to read and I went to a newsstand right in the middle of Times Square to New York say they're actually labeled newsstand and I asked\nYou know I I was trying to find something to read and they didn't have a single newspaper um they have all kinds of candy and snacks and cookies and um drinks you can buy 'em your budget you can buy lottery tickets they can buy lots of different kinds of cigarettes\nUm you can by hand sanitizer you can often by in times square they had all kinds of like Donald Trump magnets in NYPD I'm snow Globes you name it anything but a newspaper\nWhat laws govern what can be sold are there any laws and say you can sell this or not that\nBad stands um [noise]\nWere first coming up late and these are just the sidewalk newsstands that are governed by these laws not storefront newsstands I'm a new stands veterans city property you could only sell news and\nUm it was even that it was kind of hard to make a living that way so in the sixties the city agreed to let them sell cigarettes and then in the Nineteen seventies that I've read them to let them sort of like pre packaged food and items that cost less than five dollars and now that console just about anything\nKind of food and beverage wise as long as that's packaged in any kind of like knickknack or ... as long as it's under ten dollars they can't sell things like clothes um purses handbags because I think they want to keep the newsstands from competing with storefront retailers for good reason\nUm and then the city does have a law that if you're a newsstand you have to sell news and they actually the city told me they send out people to sort of a force that laws but it's a very vague law says they have to sell newspapers magazines or periodicals and from what I've seen some news fans will\nYou know they'll offer a few newspapers in the morning and then the papers all fell out and they don't really want to devote a lot of time or well a lot of space to um [noise] selling the newspapers because the margins are super low and they don't sell very much they'd rather have the space in the front dedicated the candy and\nAnd so it on things I have a lot you know much higher margins\nWe're speaking with anti the end of the wall Street Journal and you mentioned all those other products not competing with stories I Would think some of the stories in the area would not be too thrilled about some of the things that the new stance or selling\nIt you're right but this has been kind of an old tradition some of these fans have been there for\nYou know going way back ally on a long time before like you know ... came in so I think even though\nUsually the the retailers all was fight it tooth and nail when the newsstands come forward and say hey we want to start adding these products or this kind of thing there's kind of a lot of nostalgia in the city and a lot of affection so I think the city will probably do it it can to keep them going\nUm another reason is that the newsstands also serve to um [noise]\nService kind of billboards for advertising sales in the city makes about fifty five million a year from the company the\nUm rents out the sides and backs of the stand for for um selling advertising so the city wants to make sure that the newsstands can keep going it has an interest in making sure that they don't all assert folding they want to keep us
