going to be talking about politics or any of the craziness going on in our political world right now but we are going to be talking about something that affects all of us and that is our health care\nAnd this is the season right you've got pumpkin spice lattes you've got to worry about the relatives coming into town\nAnd we all have to worry about making sure that we make the right decisions for healthcare especially folks\nWho are having to deal with their Medicare annual election period\nNow I Can't do this all by myself I needed approach to help me out with all the facts and figures I don't want to lead you're wrong to joining us is Mary Granger Humanae broken relations manager for Nevada thanks for joining us thank you for having me first of all\nLet's start off a about and talking about the Medicare annual election period what's the time period that we're dealing with\nThank you for asking every year between October fifteenth on December seventh Medicare beneficiaries not just seniors you can have Medicare if you I disabled are invited to explore their health care options before they\nIt's not just seniors you can have Medicare if you are disabled are invited to explore their health care options before they're locked in for another year\nAnd that's the whole key this this is the key 'cause we all know about\nIt whether you do a Medicare or whether you you do regular healthcare it's that you and I were talking before he went on the air and it's when you get locked in to a program it can be so frustrating and and honestly I think one of the problems that I run into when I'm doing my regular health care and I think people go through this with Medicare as well\n[noise] the time gets\nYou know smaller and smaller and all of a sudden the deadlines there and you're having to make a decision and you haven't done your homework on this issue or that issue and you are stuck and you you can't pull out for for an entire year so this is really one of the big things that we're trying to do to make sure that everybody makes the right decision\nI agree you don't want to make a rash decision although Medicare does have a few\nAnnexation periods that might allow you to change your mind for the most part you're locked in for a year so all plants have been posted at Medicare dot Gov throughout the country and anybody on Medicare plan or considering the Medicare plan in the near future\nAre encouraged to at least go to that site if not one of their favorite carriers like humanity and explore what the plants are and what they have now and make sure they have everything buttoned up come December seventh which is the last day to make an election for January one\nOkay so when's the October tenth one day only six AM to six PM what's taking place\nWe're going to have a Medicare cue and they tell us on we're going to offer state license insurance agents who are extremely well versed in how humans human humans [laughter] this is a virtual fly real people ... to person about people that will answer your questions without any pressure\nTo make sure that year in the right place at the right time\nI was once told it would be very wise to know a lawyer before you ever got put in jail and I think the same thing applies to insurance you want to make sure you have the right insurance package emotion God Forbid something catastrophic hit you or your find yourself in an emergency situation\nI Can't ... you know\nCount the number of times I've heard friends and family as well when something happens and you never know when something is going to happen\nWhen you wind up at the hospital it's too late at that point\nYou need to have all of this is why they call it an insurance you need really it's a safety\nNet to to just in case\nYou you want to make sure that nothing happens you try and take care of yourself get plenty of exercise and you write and all that stuff but your body has its own mind what is going to do\nAnd you need to make sure that you do have that that kind of safety net like a circus performer or that you really have the feeling of to me it's it's just a feeling of tranquility that you know you've done the very best you don't have to be sweating it\nAbsolutely if we have\nThe luxury of time to plan a surgery or a minor procedure rarely does anything go wrong as far as insurance because the eyes have been taught AT T's have been crossed and yes that hospital or provider is in my network and they will be paid but it's the emergencies that you need to prepare for well in advance\nAnd life is full of emergencies every day's an emergency or so for a Wednesday to overturn rehab for one day only six AM to six PM we want you to call in the right down this number and don't worry if you don't have a pen right now or you're driving and\nAnd so to overturn we have for one day only six AM to six PM we want you to call in the right down this number and don't worry if you don't have a pen right now or you're driving and and you need to pull over you have to do this when you get home because I'm going to be repeating it all throughout the show\nIt's seven oh two seven six six nine one three four seven oh two seven six six\nNine one three four\nAnd if you don't have a chance to write it down all you have to do this is even easier is go to our a K accent T. dot radio dot com website and just click on the Medicare help line a graphic that you see there there's a doctor\nAnd we have all the information that you're going to be needing they're one of the the biggest problems that I have from you know when I'm doing my health care and I think\nA lot of folks shows way I'm sticking with that story I Believe on alert a but especially\nSome of our ah our seniors that are going in in in signing up for a for Medicare\nIt can be confusing and then sometimes it's in language that you don't understand or sometimes your senior thinking like hold it if I Do this plan to do I have to do this and is this connected to that that's my big problem is when you click one button it cuts out another\nPrivate transportation to and from your home to whenever you're medically necessary appointment is complimentary\nThat is very getting there is is half the battle we're talking with Mary Granger she is Humanae broker relations manager for Nevada talking about the Medicare annual election period and for one day one day only Wednesday October tenth\nFrom six AM to six PM or you're going to be able to call in and get all of your Medicare and questions answered and there's no question that's too stupid trust me\nI'm the guy who usually ask them the number that you want to call them as seven oh two seven six six nine one three four seven oh two seven six six nine one two three four and don't forget Medicare's and you'll election period is October fifteenth\nThrough December seventh this will be taking place both for that period starts this will be on October tenth\nThe whole point of this really is to make sure that you have the information you have the tools you are aren't you are filled with knowledge you know more than the website\nBy the time you go in and you start making sure that you've got all of the coverage that you need one of the little things that you had mentioned we were talking about the force sees the convenience care cost and coverage\nIs I went to the doctor this past year we go and quite a bit this one of those years we all have them where you're just like okay what broke now ah and that is if you have a situation that a doctor is looking at and you're going to come back in three days or a week or two weeks mentally I've decided this\nI've already done my co pay will know you're going back again and there's more and there's more and there's more you have to factor that in it's not like one one copay fits all\nCorrect and those co pays for office visit not for initial treatment in diagnosis yeah so you want to pay attention what is my maximum financial liability this calendar year should something happen and dying in and out of these\nOffices or complex diagnostic services or hospitals\nWhat are some of the questions that people should be asking if it if it's not on your you know starting off your list just to get going what are some of the basics that people should be wanting the answers to when they're making their Medicare annual election\nThey should be asking do I have full Medicare and by that I mean Medicare and be do I have a plan and it doesn't meet my needs this year should I explored for next year\nAnd by the way to 'cause this'll be me and I still do this when I hear the commercials and maybe you know the answer you don't if you don't know the answer asked the question no such thing as a stupid question what's the difference between a and B why do I need both isn't there see the covers all I mean you can ask anything they know the answer to\nExactly and that license agents that are receiving the calls are bilingual English and Spanish so they can fields lots of costs and lots of folks\nAnd when I was saying by the way they speak in plain English I mean where planes Spanish they just peeking is speak in plain language that you understand in it and it isn't over your head and here's the key to this is always really important and I'm Glad that these folks are doing this is that if you don't ...\nAnd it isn't over your head and here's the key to this is always really important and I'm Glad that these folks are doing this is that if you don't understand\nIf they see something that you don't get tell them\nJust stop and say I'm Sorry this just doesn't make sense to me it's okay they interested in is not the first time they've heard of before I Would do it I Would do it too because what you want to make sure as when you call these folks seven oh two seven six six nine one three four on October ... from six to six PM\nThat you are armed you are feeling confident you're feeling sassy for a change you finally know what is going on ahead of time so you don't have to worry about this any more this is something I've gone through two when I've been doing my healthcare\nIs that you think you've done a really great job\nAnd then the year takes place and then you get those big surprises you educate yourself ahead of time you don't have to worry or think or threat like is this going to be covered you're probably going to know more than the receptionist\nI agree and I like to look at insurance in a worst case scenario so I Know what I'm On the hook\nFor one time it's okay to be worse case scenario was definitely half empty yes just\nTo make sure you have those proverbial ducks in a row um and there are several ways Medicare beneficiaries not just seniors can get Medicare the federal Medicare program is a beautiful program again it works from San Diego to Rhode Island and it's eighty twenty fashion\nBut another way to get it or through these Medicare Advantage plans that were introduced in Nineteen eighty five and had been running strong sense\nMedicare Advantage plans is when you hire a company like Humanae and they assign co pays to all of those Medicare benefits you would get when you flashier red white and blue card mhm but they reduce your financial obligations or\nUm level of expense God Forbid there was something catastrophic that happened and then they put in a whole bunch of extra I'd like to call it the advantage and Medicare Advantage\nTransportation services dental allowances for vision and eye glasses Medicare will ensure your eyeballs but they think eyeglasses are a luxury yeah they'll love oh by the\nWay that is true because I run into it with my aunt before they do and I'm just like why would this not be covered exactly sense\nAnd commercial plants I think that's a huge assumption people entering Medicare think well it was covered on my employer plan so naturally it will be there and naturally is not right Medicare plans are different than commercial plans and you're going to want to ask those questions when you opt in\nJust in case it's not part of the plan maybe you're going to need exploring different insurance or additional insurance besides this but Medicare Advantage plans will give you exactly what Medicare does an ad quite a few additional benefits\nOftentimes for no monthly premium other than the cost of your anti intimate care\nAlright again we're talking with me a merry Granger she's Humanae broker relations manager for Nevada talking about this event that is going to be taking place a Medicare help line of going to take place before this is important before the Medicare and you'll election period so when you go in and you start making your decisions\nOf between October fifteenth and December seventh you are so well armed it's taking place five days before the election periods starts it's going to be Wednesday October tenth\nFrom six AM to six PM one day only and you can call and get literally anything answer that you need it seven oh two sets\nThey October tenth from six AM to six PM one day only and you can call and get literally anything answered that you need at seven oh two seven six six nine one two three four\nLet's talk about how people can learn is that going up to this this event taking place how they can kind of arm themselves a little bit more what other ways can they get more information what websites\nThank you know nationally Medicare dot Gov a and it Medicare time dot com and every state in our United States has what's called a ship program yellow pages white pages you can\nFind the way this morning on my on my porch your Medicare book uh no my my wife pages oh I hadn't seen what I was looking at it is in there\nIt is in there it is in there and then every Medicare beneficiary today should be receiving if not already a Medicare and you handbook you can also find them at the libraries and the Social Security office\nAll right let's recap some of the things that that we have been talking about in case folks have been missing this or they wanted a ... sometimes I knew things were repeated\nActually everyday anything's repeated to be quite honest with you who is eligible for Medicare is there going in to this period maybe they haven't signed up before maybe they just need a a a reminder\nIf anybody has any doubts about their Medicare eligibility they should call Social Security but most people who are us citizens or have worked in the United states for at least ten years\nThey may qualify for Medicare and anybody who has Medicare part a and B may explore one of these Medicare Advantage plans come October fifteenth\nAll right and then also we\nKnow most of us were doing our health care and I think this the supplies most of the time there's some out and they're here and there you're stuck with your decision for a year typically yes [laughter] yeah\nAnd so what were the really the point of what we're trying to tell you is don't be stuck be confident it's sort of like you know I'm Elton John's come to town right and I know I Want to seal John So I Am going to make this decision in the click that box I'm going to get out my M. X. cards and I'm gonna buy those tickets\n'cause I Know when I Need these tickets it's exactly what I Want to see so you want to make sure that when you go and you make that decision and you click that box that this is the exact decision that you want to me oh John won't help you with your Medicare though but I'm just telling you that that's how really sure you want to be when you go in and you make your elections\nCorrect and unlike Elton John tickets we won't sell out yes but it's important that we make a visual I mean you know medicine can be expensive but still Elton can be a little bit more\nCorrect you just want to make sure you have a decision in motion by December seventh\nAll right so I'm against some of the initial things that you want to keep in mind when you are looking at your a Medicare coverage some of the most important things again you\n...\n\n\nNa\nNa na\nA\n\nA\n\n\nUm\n\n\n\n\n\nWants to seniors served for many years as the c._e._o. of IBM and built the company into an international success\nStories told the during a business meeting in Nineteen eleven Watson became frustrated by the lack of good ideas being generated\nThe trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough he declared no which is the result of thought and thought he was the keynote up success in this business\nOr any business today the word sank adorn the walls of IBM buildings everywhere and remains at the heart of the ...\nToday the word think adorn the walls of IBM buildings everywhere and remains at the heart of the company's identity no one would dispute the value of good thinking but sometimes we're so busy doing that we don't take time to stop\nAnd think and learn in our eagerness to get things done we may worry that whenever we aren't busy acting or acting busy we're wasting time but in reality our work is most effective when it's informed\nBy good thinking and that takes time pausing to sink and learn\nCan be time well spent it's how we progress and improve as one professor road we live and work today in a learning economy\nWe can't just be knowledge workers\nWe must also be learning workers and learning requires recharging and reflection not constant action life never stopped teaching so we must never stop learning wise lifelong learners\nUntil we meet again make peace be with you this day and always\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the justice of heart ... studios twenty a up north Las Vegas ...

episodes of the show and they do thirty hours of mystery science theater three thousand on Thanksgiving turkey because turkeys are bad movies\nAnd it was always a a big thing and I remember when I was watching that stuff in college we would set up like a bank VCRs and because we didn't have cable back at home and my sister and I\nWould each have cable and our respective apartments and we would just

turkeys I'll start talking about Christmas movies at Christmas Time and then I'll be of course talking about a war movies the beginning of the year so I have different things that happened\nThroughout the year so it's not always going to be horror movies but I Love to just dive in at Halloween time\nThat some people do I like to watch a horror movie a day around Halloween and a lot of times it's old standbys like I watched the other night I watched the original the body Snatchers Nineteen Seventy eight with my son who's ten who've never seen it before and I lost sleep over that movie when I was ten I think he handled it a little differently than I did but he\nIt with my son who's ten who'd never seen it before and I lost sleep over that movie when I was ten I think he handled it a little differently than I did but he kind of got sucked in it was funny watching them he\nHe was into that movie that is a great movie it's one of my favorite of all times and and it's the best version of it I think I Love the original with Kevin McCarthy but the one in Nineteen Seventy eight with Donald Sutherland and Brooke Adams is so visceral and pragmatic and realistic\nAnd and and the tops the other remakes that they did like in Nineteen Ninety three they did one with Gabrielle Anwar and they did a\nRemake in two thousand seven I think with a Nicole Kidman and Daniel Craig that one's kind of a mass\nNineteen Seventy eight to really good one but the other thing I Do with my kids every year and this goes back to me when I was in high school there was a theater in town called the Drexel north and it was his big eight hundred seat theater that is now a fitness center\nWhich is sad and it's All right\nBut it was this big eight hundred and the theater and they do twenty four hour marathons where they show twelve or Thirteen horror movies all night long and they'd have trailers and cartoons and a short films and little bits and theater bumpers that that's always made it very\nSpecial that experience now I was in high school in the eighties so that was your only option to see some of these movies yeah she had VHS\nBut you're also looking at it on a Nineteen inch TV in your parents' basements and you weren't watching them on the big screen so I Would go to these only movie marathons and I loved it there was a huge deal for me in the late eighties and early nineties now they still do them because of scheduling and some other things happen in my life I'm not able to go to them all the time\nBut it's a little easier to do them at home you know because we have better TV's we have Blu ray and and and what I also do is I I Do a mini marathon now every year for my family\nOf horror movies it used to be twenty four hours but I just don't have the strength for that anymore I Do like a twelve or Thirteen hour fourteen hour horror movie marathon\nAnd you know I had like my dad come over and my kids were there and my wife was doing concessions and I put together trailer blocks in or we watch cartoons like looney tunes and so it's a lot of fun and I make it as much like a theatrical experience as possible\nThis year to the movies that we watched I wanted to review on this show and I might drop a couple of later on because they're classics and one of the things that I've done as a parent and a movie lover is I have\nMade a point to expose my kids not just to the movies that are out there in the theaters right now those are great you know I Love taking my kids are the marvel movies of the star wars movies and all that good stuff\nBut I also like them to the older film and I'm not just talking about the algae eighties stuff that I saw when I was a kid or like I mentioned I watched it Beijing the body Snatchers Nineteen Seventy eight version with my son the other day\nThose or something I saw it could even older ones I like to during these marathons I pick stuff out of the\nDifferent errors I I like showing them the old monster movies from the forties I think it's it's worth something cinematic linked to expose children to the black and white movies the movies that were made long before digital technologies long before any sort of modern filmmaking techniques up that was\nMade long before I was even alive\nLike the wolf man and Frankenstein and Dracula those are worth showing and not just an usher horror genre I mean it's worth showing himself like Citizen Kane and classic movies because not everything has happened in your lifetime and you need to have a sense of history not just for history of the history of the world in the country and the people but\nOf cinema one of them that we did this weekend was return of the vampire Bela Lugosi starts as a vampire who writes us from London grave during the bombing of World War two\nI think oh\nWho writes us from London grave during the bombing of World War two\nLike oh I think oh so you're one of the night oh\nWe never find that about [noise]\nThis is considered sort of an on officials sequel to Dracula it was made by Columbia Pictures\nUniversal of course the Dracula they held the rights so Columbia couldn't do another Dracula movie in ... there was the only play Dracula twice in his entire lifetime he played him in Dracula and then he played him in advocates Telhami Frankenstein\nHe played vampires though like you said it's an unofficial sequel to Dracula ... daughter and son Dracula revoke their and wild Bela Lugosi shut up and all these other\nUniverses a horror movies like you're the wolf man he played Baylor the gypsy and he played ego or in the Reagan signed me up in a ghost Frankenstein he played various characters but this is a fun little it's very much cut from the same quality of Dracula only you know about it I think twelve years later it was when they made it\nIf classic Lugosi it's got the classic\nElements to the graveyards the bats you've got a wearable if in there who talks plain English which is kind of silly but they they have all these elements and you have the those are the police detective who who doesn't believe any of it\nThis is a fun movie it's worth tracking down especially if you have shown\nYounger generation the original Dracula and taught them to appreciate watching it black and white movie that's not going to be the special effects and action from an ad and enjoy the atmosphere now this isn't as atmosphere\nAs the Nineteen thirty one version the Nineteen thirty one Dracula is very American set designers results do for the academy frame and it's very intricate and intense this one's a little more mainstream for the time this was around the time they were making the man and frightened Siamese ... man as opposed to just coming out of\nThe silent era Nineteen thirty one when the original ... laws but still this is worth checking out it was sort of a loss favorite would be able to go see the return of the vampire\nRocks well still [noise]\nYou're listening to the fact that the movies with Kevin car I just have a couple minutes talk really quickly about the one house and that's all I really need directed by Toby Cooper may Nineteen eighty one group of teenagers go to a carnival and hide overnight and the fun house only to be struck by abusing killer\nThing is alive\nSomething not like his father something better to something that has the form of human flesh [noise]\n[noise]\n\nThis is very similar to how fast which is out right now there is this is just a slasher is not a particularly good slasher\nIt has some great imagery to it and it has a great box covered had always had a great VHS box cover\nBut it's in essence it's it's a bunch of teams going into a bad situation and being struck by killer not much more takes a long time to get to the the the slasher part of the slasher and other than that the characters are terribly memorable they're not terribly well developed this is ...\nIt to the the the slasher part of the slasher and\nOther than that the characters aren't terribly memorable they're not terribly well developed this is exactly the kind of movie that came out in the early eighties that was trying to play off of all the success of friday the thirteenth and the Halloween movies so it's sort of one of those things I have never seen I've wanted to see\nBut I have to say it it didn't really grabbed me as a horror movie even as a retro horror movie somebody love the eighties I grew up in the eighties this one really somewhat forgivable so I'm going to have to say the fun house kind of sucked it can is that\nWhen they did that and I do like that that that's it for this segment when it come back I'm going to be talking about the new movies in theaters and buses are as more and\nIndividuals and businesses with tax problems\nThe first time we saw that I'm On the big screen was in Spider Man three eleven years ago\nIt was not particularly done well the version of venom that you saw on Spiderman three was not the version of venom that you saw in the comic books I never read the comic books I've just heard plenty of fans of the comic books complain about that and so when they got a new better movies are given a standalone better movie there was a lot of excitement and the geek world\nAnd to their credit they get their own rent a movie it is that um and and other alien parasites but it's basically venom\nTom Marty's very good in this movie you can actually hear what he says he faces and covered [laughter] when he's talking like Mad Max or the dark Knight Rises or done Kirk he does find in the movie in fact I think he elevates the movie way more than it really should be\nThe story is really I mean\nIt's got the billionaire or trying to colonize other planets it's got this weird environmental message but this anti you know billionaire message you know and it's it's got like things happening you hear the story construction moments where you're like well I don't even understand\nHow that pragmatically happens you know they're stealing homeless people in running experiments on them and then making them disappear but somehow they're stealing them and having them signed waivers but then they just dump them in a landfill to get rid of it is the strangest\nSet up of a movie that I've seen that that takes so much time to explain\nThe nuance of what they're doing with it making no sense also the acting Tom Hardy good everyone else's terrible Michelle Williams is in the movie she plays his girlfriend or is ex girlfriend and\nShe's awful in this movie and and I'm not a huge fan of Michelle Williams but I've seen her movies and I there are times when I think she's done quite well I thought she was actually she was one of the best things and Brokeback Mountain I thought she was the best performance and that one I thought she was a fantastic performance of Manchester by the seat\nOf the ones that she gets a lot of accolades for stuff like my week with Marilyn I'm like that one was dumb\nI didn't like her in that so she kind of blows hot and cold boy she pulls really called on this one she is terrible in this movie the other thing with the movie it's it's it's very an even if it feels like it was shot to be are rated and I think they were going for that they're going for violent\nGreedy you know something that could stand up with Logan or\nThat pool but then they decided to make a PG Thirteen and so it seems very cobble the editing is really clunky especially in the action sequences like a point where venom like kill somebody and then they leave and then you don't see any remains you don't even see a sweater and you're like well that doesn't even make any sense\nSo feels like they really sanitizing in a lot of ways\nAnd then on top of it they put this comedy in there they put the sort of lap sticky blew the moments that do not work in as dark of a movie as a sit\nIn a really or jarring it's it's almost like they said add more comedy we need we need to be funny 'cause the comic book movie and that way it feels like it was made it like the ... century\nIt was feels more in line with something like ... on or the movie daredevil with Ben Affleck or ghost rider with Nicholas cage all that stuff that came out before the summer of two thousand eight when the dark Knight and Iron Man totally changed the field\nThat step things up that was when marvel studios started making their movies and that's when the dark Knight really said hey this is what superhero movies could be\nBut otherwise it's it's really I mean I'm I'm going to have to say that ... kind of sucks as well it can\nHey this is what superhero movies but otherwise it's really I mean I'm I'm gonna have to say that Ben I'm kind of sucks is well it can is okay that's it for this segment I Need to go to when I come back I'm going to be talking about retro puppet master box office in the home sort of around ... between tales from the\n...

Nelson you've got bill Corbett who played brain guy and crow and then of course Kevin Murphy who's been with it forever plane Tom Service\nAnd they rent the movie they do a commentary tracking it and it can make terrible movies kind of funny [noise] the other reason I think this is because it's stars somebody from one of the worst movies ever made ... who's known for being in the room\nAnd he of course wrote the book the disaster artist which would you made a new movie last year with James Franco\nWhich was one of my favorite movies of the year so I thought it was interesting to to sort of see this this bizarre piece of cinema history from the director video shells and retro puppet master the rooms grace the sterile stars as a young Andre to on a French puppeteer who creates a group of disturbing puppets that are brought to light\nBooms\n\nAt all\nSo maybe\nI'll be honest when I first picked this I thought it was just a renamed version of the original puppet master\nIt was the the puppet master series is from full moon and I have always had a lot of respect for full moon they were a direct a video series Charles Band had been making movies in the eighties either he was actually involved in stuff like re enemy or which is a fantastic film\nAnd Dole and troll\nThen eventually he developed the full moon brand which was big in the late eighties and through the nineties which was a directive video\nCompany they just released everything on VHS nothing ever got a theatrical release I mean like dolls originally did like his first earlier films but when he was doing the full moon stuff\nThey were stuff that he just crank out and there was a certain amount of kids to him he did these things called subspecies which had", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "06"}
