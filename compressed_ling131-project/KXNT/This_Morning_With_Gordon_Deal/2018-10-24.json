taking a stab at addressing college affordability on their own\nMarketwatch reporter Julian Berman says the result is a patchwork of experiments across the country working out the kinks of a love the idea in real time and we both soaring praise an intense criticism Jillian what's happening\nOver the past you know ten or so years um\nLocal communities states and others across the country have been experimenting with providing students with tuition free college and the idea kind of got a boost with the presidential elections that we saw Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton talk a lot about different ways that they could potentially make college ... college free\nRight so given example or two of who is drawing watch\nYeah so states like Tennessee are you know arguing programs where they make community college free to you know to students in their state\nUm and the idea behind those kind of level of programs as you know it's a little bit more about workforce development so in Tennessee they were like we need to attract more companies here to attract more companies here we need college educated workers how are we going to get them we're gonna make college easier to pay for it and then they will you know local communities that\nHave these programs so the most famous example is in Kalamazoo, Michigan\nWhere a group of anonymous donors said in two thousand five you know everybody who graduates basically from ... we're going to pay for them to go to college in Michigan\nAnd the idea behind those programs is that if you give the community free college kind of as an incentive than other organizations step up to make it to that students can take advantage of it to the public high schools get better um\nNon profits you know do more to offer after school tutoring you know the sort of the community rallies together to prepare these students\nUm for school and that's better for the community and now they're also individual schools that are you know\nSort of making some kind of tuition\nSeem like the organizers are having to hit up a lot of donors are kind of getting some of the bigger companies around the area to chip in\nYou know that's kind of one of the reasons why advocates of these things like the idea of the federal government doing it because then they can you know the funding is a little precarious\nBut yeah it's actually a lot of community college systems are starting to offer these programs and at that level you know community colleges do that sort of the huge on reading armed other\nColleges so it's really you know it really like tapping donors repeatedly and they're trying to get corporations that kind of be sustaining donors for these programs that it can be hard and if you you know promised students that you're going to do that you started to deliver on it\nOr yeah it's a stable funding I mean is that the phrase you are going forward in terms of must tabs for these programs to continue and thrive\nA performance and his um his a kind of insulting style um maybe there's all sorts\nUm maybe there was also thinking in this environment political vibrant we're in today that's the only thing that works we like it but maybe he's got a point\nAnd I think finally as somebody pointed out three of the column the price of opposing Trump within the party was higher than some people thought they some of the people who spoke out against him at the beginning just got hammered out at the base of the party\nAnd um that became too painful and so they've kind of backed off and in some cases uh my uh my source said they've just shut up so I think it's a combination of things\nWhat if Democrats win the house and the Senate in the fall\nI think then you know this gets to a point that should be remembered which is you know everything is fickle and politics and\nIf people are you adding by Trump while the building is good or if it's not I don't think there's a lot of loyalty to him that's long term and people could shift fairly rapidly and if they lose control the house and Senate then people will start to ask themselves well as the downside of supporting Donald Trump at parties\nSpokesman Andy image too high is is
