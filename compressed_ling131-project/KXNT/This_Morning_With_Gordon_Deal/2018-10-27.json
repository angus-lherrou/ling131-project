certainly where one of those\nAre and then you go\nOkay let me go back for a minute because they don't want to leave and the audience in the lurch you were talking about where the ash and it really rang a bell with me again underscoring my ah being a farmer it's ... uh but I hadn't really thought about it the way you described it\nI have just ordered two days ago sixty times of ... to be delivered to the farm to spread on my hay fields because all the guys that I Know who have used it have found and had a fabulous impact on the uncle entity\nThat ... some of it in New England can be pretty cynic and the uncle entity is helped a great deal by using these ... and ...\nThe ... some of it in New England can be pretty cynic and the uncle entity is helped a great deal by using this wood ash and then what you just said\nAbout the trees and what gets out of you know obviously was coming out of the ... goes to make the tree grow and when you burn it you're not really burning all of this stuff that's in the tree the best what's\nLeft to uh uh is the best part of the tree and you put it back on the ground is like recycling in a sense Mother Nature recycling yes\nYes and that's why the trees drop the leaves and they recycle the minerals in the middle east and I was blessed to Doug my professor sells for four years at the University of Missouri that taking my first college course in agriculture\nWas William Albrecht and I don't know if you know that name but he was a genius and he was considered the father of organic farming and you know they can\nYes I Know now that I Know the name yeah I remember yeah OK\nEverybody else is out drinking beer all weekend during the weekends when I was four years and actually I was sitting in Sanborn feels that experimental fields is the University of Missouri and he was just talking to me I was his protege and ... he'd need something they had run go get it and make it happen and put this in this [noise] um role in the field and so forth\nAnd so I really um spent four years dealing with William Albrecht and he was just a a genius when it came to soil health and he would dump would ashes and ground up rocks and things like that into the hills and show how it really a ... um stimulated plant grows and so forth and planned health\nUh but you have to be very interesting to do an analysis of the uh uh would ashes you're dumping airfield does it do they contain three Merrill's twelve and they're all Fifteen middles twenty miles so it wouldn't hurt 'til you could go to the university and assaults department and they'll give you an al\nIs yeah I Would that that's fascinating that this is coming from a plant in New Hampshire that burns word to make power\nAnd they distribute the excess ash it doesn't cost anything all your newspaper the trucking bring it in and spread it around and it's just something that makes a whole lot of sense and he makes it even more sense now and then you explain some of the stuff that I wasn't thinking about it so\nWell yeah I don't even see it again you know various state because when you look at the top twenty longevity cultures in the world Nineteen at the top twenty or ... or a third world cultures they don't have electricity they still use wood for fuel and they're still putting it would actually their gardens\nAnd these are the ones all over the world these are the cultures all over the world that live the longest according to the blue zones and National Geographic and they can't figure it out and they take all that maybe their spiritual or this and that will maybe they are\nAnd what ... what makes them live longer is are getting those minerals um in their gardens\nAnd it's not the same I'm guessing Dr wallich as burning coal because even though Cole is a fossil fuel that comes from the ground and cetera et cetera so does oil and gas but it's not the same thing there's something that happens in burning the actual word that's different than burning coal I'm guessing yeah\nWell cool does have minerals in it okay for the people you just have to other coal ash is out in the gardens also yeah OK but I'm a you know again you're dealing with um other issues here because when you have coal you can have them\nCarbon compounds that can be toxic if the cold is not completely burnt\nAnd so forth so there's other issues there\nThere are a lot of fabulous

furniture and a lawn mowers an outdoor equipment and anything else you've got for the warm weather season you're running a little tight an outside storage well Scheck can be a great solution and also ... project our project\nBut before you began that there are four important things you have to consider now we've got the chips in today's ... project presented my advisor dot com\nNow first the average cost to build a should is a pretty wide range we're talking about between eight hundred and four grand it depends on the true choosing whether you're going to build yourself for her and re pro but what do you decide to be a white or not there are several basic questions need to ask you saw before you start shopping\nYeah first of all do you need a permit I think a lot of people forget and think oh it's my house and I can do whatever I Want and I'm going to do this thing or I'm going to put up a fan\nYou can't always just go and do that you have to check your local building called first to determine if you need a permit to build a chat on your property now you don't want to find out after\nYou finished the project that it's got to come down because it violated some building code orange zoning code I mean that's the last thing you want to do it and that's a bunch of money and then have to take it all down and then do it again\nNow the other big thing you've got to think about is what size this year shed needs to be and what do you want it to be you know do you need something simple and you know primarily for just business needs putting things in there and not making a cute or any other functions or do you want something decorative\nThere are so many different styles and size is out there that you really need to evaluate your home and your property and how you're going to use that so that you can determine the best style for what your shed gonna be\nA part of that is deciding where the show is going to go I mean depending on the size of your property you get a lot of different options for the placement that shit now folks very calmly might put it close to the house which makes running power in ... or\nSometimes folks will talk it sort of insider the back of the property so that it's less obvious but put some thought into that because you're going back and forth a lot and you don't want to regret the decision\nAnd finally what your budget I mean did you get a tight budget you can build a very simple should that gets the job done without a lot of frills but it's got some wiggle room you could think about adding some extra features like integrated shelving inside\nDecorative trim on the outside or you could go all out man cave or she should and maybe at electricity sheet swimming\nWall to wall stereo I don't know [laughter] you know you can really totally decked out those are fun too but I think it through in mind that budget comes out just the way you expect\nNow if you do go pro we recommend getting estimates from at least two or three contractors before you choose the one pro that's going to help you with the project and I say pro project presented back home advisor dot com with home advisor you can get matched with top rated homes

looking for a better shot or\nWe have today I'm Hi I'm calling in because I wanted to find out um I had an old Victorian house and I had a a three three three\nI had a ... or ... and when it wasn't a shower the second floor and then I Want to take a shower or when the water up the or on the air for the shower go with cold and I've been an egg creme contractors and my former and I'm not getting an answer so I like to remedy that says I'm remodeling\nOkay so are you opening up walls is part of remodeling\nYes I Am completely stripped down to the fed\nOkay great so first of all the reasons you have reduced water pressure an older homes are generally because you have old steel pipes that suffer from internal resting and they clog the closed down color clogged arteries and then you can't push enough water through it\nAnd that could be your main water pipe that could be the supply pipes that are inside the house\nOr a combination of them and so since you're taking the walls of the general rule of thumb is whenever you expose these old steel pipes you want to replace them with copper pipes um or with tax was different to a newer type of plumbing pipe now the other thing is that you may have enough water pressure coming in from the street\nWell one of the pressure is not that big of a deal because I think the pressure on okay you just said like basically we have to bear from going out and you can only use one at a time by the water completely goes ice cold shower somebody on than eager to think\nWell that's because the the pipes may not be supplying the hot water may not be moving into hot water what's that water heater do you have um forty hours or less minimum size but should be okay for for two bathrooms okay and is it an older water heater\nUm no I just replace or to hear\nWhen you replace it that they're changing the plumbing around it this is going through the steel pipes\nThat they changed the hype around the no I don't think\nYou need to talk with your plumbers about what kind of pipes you have whether or not that's considered him the problem and need to know where the water pressure is at the street because if you're not getting enough pressure that could be the whole cause of it\nOkay now I go there and I saw something online called a um a pressure ballot now what they were many issue at all\nSo pressure valve valve is designed to be used primarily in the shower and what it does is it keeps the mix between hot and cold balance so that you don't get scorching or freezing cold waters when the pressure drops so if somebody wants to say run hot water downstairs and now rival at hot water from the upstairs shower\nIt would not change the balance of water from the mix of water between hot and cold so the flow would be less you'd have less of a stream but it wouldn't be the temperature wouldn't change okay right okay no that's not a I don't think that's the cause I mean that would that would certainly be a good thing to have\nSomething you should consider but I don't think that's the reason you're not getting hot water on the second floor just on the can moving enough water up there\nOkay so basically what I Need to do is tell them to check the piping around the water heater again\nA plumber should know this not only to run the water heater would basically if you're going to one of those walls what kind of pipes do you have\nAnd are they corroded and should they be replaced to help groups who are up to help alleviate this okay I'm In of all else fails you could always had a second water heater upstairs if you had a checklist water heater which would be a really small unit and it would supply additional water and the second for bathroom\nWow okay okay okay well I think that kind of remedy the problem\nAll right thanks so much for calling them money pet Haiti fresh clean water\nOkay that's interesting okay well I think that there were many the problem\nAll right thanks so much for calling the money pet
