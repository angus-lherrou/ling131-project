free speech one consequence more violent protests on college campuses across the country\nMarketwatch reporter Julian Berman says speaking engagements with high profile figures who make headlines from inflammatory comments have been expensive as campuses shell out to create a safe environment for free speech joined explain\nTo the costs are mostly um around security so and and a lot of cases when these people come to visit you know there's a lot of protests activity around it [noise] um so you know sometimes I can get dangerous a and a lot of cases to protest\nThe protests are kept their also combined with you know supporters of um of these people are coming to support them as well and so sort of the clashes between those two\nYou know means that colleges have to up security\nSo you've got our resume campus security and or campus police and occasionally you got to hire an outside actual police force\nRight exactly so a lot of uh a lot of colleges have their own um campus police forces you know so those are sworn police officers um\nLike any other police agency but you know they can be pretty small so when a when a big event happens and sometimes it's not even controversial like say you know a a big football game do work with other law enforcement agencies in the area\nAnd then in addition to that sometimes leaving hire private security guard so companies that that will provide 'em you know private security staff and those people aren't for police officers but they can do things like direct traffic they can and you know sort of help guide people to safe area\nTo make sure

allow\nPeople to speak on their campus um even if they're going to incite violence so more insight disruption I guess I should say so [noise] you know they can put certain restrictions on them like time place and manner so they\nCan try to you know maybe say well the only time that the person can comments during spring break maybe but they still have to allow them to come\nAnd so you know they thought to allow them to come and\nThey basically according to the Supreme Court precedent they usually have to absorb the security costs for that too\nTo be just having an open door just try and she
