him or he doesn't need us so Hitler has he has he ever hand here he has the opportunity to play a little a little harder to get in he certainly was so when we really had to go begging at his style on the table and which they get this done\nRight so there was a the conference in Casablanca and and then later to Iran I think in a was terrain in Nineteen forty three and again for forty three correct\nThey have an even at this point they have their eye and sort of carving up the post war world ah and skilled at this point you know I I see pictures Roosevelt still it's pretty robust\nOr you know he you know might might standards the Nineteen forties he was an older guy but by today's standards he was only like sixty years old we tend to think of him and you know in our mind that he was like eighty but he was he was a relatively young guy um but he looked pretty healthy even in in Nineteen forty three\nUm but I I Want to back up all of them in and talk about the assassination squads Hitler we're sending over the United states because I didn't know about this until I read your book\nOh yeah they were what was going on the other side of history that has now been revealed and this is what's so interesting about about writing things afterwards\nBecause that bad confessions come out diaries or published a you know with a documents are declassified that men can really go back\nAnd really and that's what I like to do um some people right to make friends I write to solve murders a call me crazy so you can really go back and pieced together the snippets of of what was going on so I'm the decay inspiring with the Nazis firing\nOr was the largest by Iranian and American history thirty three members and that they were over here to assassinate and sabotage anything if they get their hands on um operation Pistorius' or was another notch he's firing eight members\nOr they were created after Pearl Harbor\nOr they attacked civilians targets and has a stake and they were all caught and they leave\nEach one of them except for one seven of them got the electric chair one got Thirty years in prison because he flipped on the other ones did they ever get close to Roosevelt\nOh yeah absolutely they did but Stalin was closer Stalin had infiltrated so much Roosevelt Roosevelt's I'm White House it was it was incredible so this is it this is what I was saying about the parallels to modern\nDay and people think oh this was Seventy some odd years every five years or whatever what have you oh this you know this was all history is not all of his reasons repeating itself okay so here we have in the White House again\nI'm Roosevelt was basically\nScrewing everything in the White House and here we have another another president who's accused of all of these things prior to being in the White House and uh the the Russians had completely infiltrated the communists completely and frustrated at the White House\nAnd we'll talk about that I'm sure down the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating\nWhite House and we'll talk about that I'm sure down the road and here we go again here's Trump the same thing he's being accused of the Russians infiltrating his White House\nSo you mean example of give me an example in in rows of those White House so some of the the communist and the hand he's here\nFor the first communist that overhead as there was a Monday house which was um a Woodrow Wilson's 'em right hand man as far as um the communists and so forth they came that were involved in um FDR's White House\nI couldn't list them all uh there there were\nThere were hundreds of them at least Fifteen higher ranking officials in the White House winnowing communist starting with Harry Dexter why all the way through the elder us and they were in all kinds of different uh and also Harry Hopkins which turned out later he\nWas fingered in Nineteen Ninety you know talk about Harry Hopkins that are at length later\nSo they don't get bored and go away it's more common [laughter] um\nThe or the White House at the White House had been infiltrated it in the following places that I could find the agricultural adjustment administration the attorney general's office the department of state the national labor relations board the labor advisory board\nOr the war productions board the price of administration the U.S Treasury Department [laughter] U.S Treasury department was infiltrated by the communists was incredible and the public welfare committee\nSo I won't bore you on with the laundry list but it's in my book of all of the people who were you know who were in that list or who are high ranking officials in those are in that list of of people so I mean he was just\nCommunists were all around them Harry Hopkins actually was the HHS secretary of state\nHe was one of the architects of the new deal\nIt was one of FDR's closest friends in confidence and he was one of the top officials who sent to you know obviously\nEvery every I couldn't travel very well because of his affliction and you know the races in the wheelchair and so far so we had to have someone fly over to talk of Stalin and so forth\nAnd uh that person was Harry Hopkins um who's Harry Hopkins actually was a friends of Eleanor Roosevelt 'em through the ah CPU essay the Communist Party the United states of America which is still in existence by the way up north I mentioned that or not\nAnd how Hopkins in style and get on famously\nHe was actually ... Harry Hopkins as time went by he was also architect could lend lease program to help\nThe Soviets out\nSo Harry Hopkins ... famously got along with Joseph Stalin because Stalin was warming the waters in America before all of this happened okay I'll get to that in a minute or he was Harry Hopkins afterwards fire afterwards was fingered\nBy a KGB the factor and I'm going to butcher this name 'em all they grew up ... and there's a name here I just simply couldn't even begin to pronounce they both identified 'em they were both KGB defectors they both identified\nHarry Hopkins is the mysterious agent Nineteen who is contacting a Soviet Union\nAbout uh the the than on a project which of course we all know was a nuclear weaponry so here we have I mean there are informants inspires all around the FDR\nSo so the point where they he goes to the wrong conference you know I mean ... uh styling knows more about Roosevelt then Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt meeting at these conferences\nAmong conference you know I mean ... a style and knows more about Roosevelt than Roosevelt knows about Roosevelt\nMeeting at these conferences it was just it was incredible how how penetrated the Americans were uh at the hands of a an athlete's weren't like that they didn't want information they just wanted to kill him Stalin right information right he had plans in the post war world of taking\nAmerica was have communist anyway he had plans are taking over America and making them a full communist country with him as a ruler so he was all diluted in his own in his own right but how this all happened was\nPrior to this of course this was a new ideology communism while this is great you know no one suffers and everyone does this and that and\nYou know we don't have to go to work in every word is provided for well Stalin had sent invitations\nTo 'em\nOr directors in Hollywood a union leaders are college professors he knew the target\nAnd they were were sent invitations all expenses paid to go over to Russia to see how this this work and they went to a city in the city is names escaping on than it is are listed in my book\nIn the ... they were to observe how Russia did things and how everyone was cared for and how this worked in how terrific it was and look at what we've done and you need to do this to your country because you're you know look at you look at your depression that's going on and so forth he really sees the opportunities town was not a stupid guy\nRight I I had an author on a couple of years ago who wrote a book about Ernest Hemingway and how they tried to recruit anyway\nYet had loudly so it was a fictitious town that didn't exist there was made it hard work basically so they can village a Potemkin village and there you go um\nHe sends all of these people home with of literature and propaganda as to how they can transform their country meeting our country into this wonderful new ideology they didn't know anything about evil umpires you know in the new deal you gotta cut Roosevelt will get a break here should never been done before\nSo this was an experiment in amongst itself so there's a lot going on here there's a lot of the backdoor dealings and strength point by Stalin silent as the puppet master\nHe uh he's this guy what he managed to accomplish in his wife was incredible it was one of the six original members of the votes of the revolution and he ended up they just didn't make fun of style and\nHe was nothing more than a he used to\nKeep the party's journals and use the column\nComrade with Conrad index card used to call him a blur used to make fun of him because he was just so worthless in the party\nOne by one he knocked off everyone in the party to take control I mean the guy was it was just incredible what a what a ruthless megalomaniac this guy was\nStanding stop I'm Sorry I'm Len wrote that in his a quote from lens will come redstone is to root too dangerous remove him\nAnd after Stalin's death they they called him a you know a pencil pusher and all kinds of stupid things\nDial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle again dial pound to five zero and see the key word free bottle method

... you know you're on the east coast it's three forty in the morning and a three hours is a long stretch to talk so just want to make sure you're you're doing OK and we appreciate you being here with us and staying up late so\nI'm I wanted to talk about you know so much of the post world are so much in the post\nWar world is a result and then in the ensuing Cold War and and all of that\nReally is a result of FDR's frail condition he's greatly diminished mental capacity at the conference in your pain forty\nFour when when that post war world\nWas really carved up and style and obviously you know took advantage he seized upon Roosevelt sprout condition\nOr and and um\nFDR really didn't know what happened he just was so out of it but I mean you you look at those pictures of FDR at the the conference\nAnd obviously he is is he looks like death warmed over but seven months before at the Tehran Conference he looks is as fit as a federal I mean ... what is going on with what happened in those seven months\nWell up until this point we've been talking about the bond that we haven't talked much about the horrors that way we haven't talked about the murder and what's going on with them um every hour as being slowly poison from within the White House and I have to\nBe very careful here not to give this book away but it was a type of toys and let's see we're used to thinking of America is the leading edge on things and knowing all these things and what they were poisoning with with something that was\nPlentiful that they didn't know was poisonous yet but\nThe rest of the world certainly did Europe certainly some of those countries in Europe or Fifteen hundred years old maybe older so in certain situations they hit a jump on us and you know I don't think grandpa Walton would've known anything about poisoning or the after effects of this poisoning especially 'cause they didn't know it was poisonous at the time so\nFDR as being slowly poison from inside the White House every time he goes away too Warm Springs Georgia\nTo sow his ailing legs\nAnd go on a retreat so weak and mentally and physically rejuvenate himself he starts to get stronger every time he comes back to the White House he starts to get sick or so I [laughter]\nI did a little digging into this because it was just so what started me on this whole thing of FDR I thought it was a little suspicious and a little too convenient that in\nThe tiny march of Eighteen days\nA Roosevelt Hitler and Mussolini had all died conveniently it'd be on that or I thought that was a little convenient\nSo this is what people actually we just start looking into this for and this and that I also thought I was interviewing that FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was uh\nThat FDR just died of natural causes as allied troops were storming Hitler's bunker I thought that was a little to get a little bit convenient so and when I started to dig in and I saw that the the odd deterioration of this president during this time period\nAnd said you know wait a minute I I really got to look into this I didn't believe it in high school when we were taught about it back to them they actually taught history you know I mean\n[laughter] but in the book you point out how he he doctors I guess Dr mcentire admiral navy admiral mcentire his personal physician and then he's cardiologist Dr Howard grew in they were they had\nNo idea what was going on and they were doing X rays and take doing all of these cats they were really clueless\nWell and this is where you know this is where the rubber finally started to meet the road for me they really work for what they were thinking the American public just thought oh he ... for us\nAnd you know he was the advance of polio and this and that and the other thing and\nThe symptoms of the his doctors were absolutely baffled he had a bunch of doctors Emma Ross McIntyre who's the White House physician he was also the vice admiral and in a certain sort of in general in the navy\nUm you know he was actually ours physician from thirty to forty five until he died a Dr Howard ruin was a commander in the navy a course FDR's a navy guy who's going to have maybe doctors\nOr he was chief of cardiology it but as though I mean these are heavy hitters they have no idea what's wrong with this guy no idea [noise] so what they do is they take him to the doctor of the day and the reason why they're so baffled\nAs because FDR is getting sick after meal times this is my first hand something was wrong in his blood pressure would bounce he would go normal and then it would go it would go roaring out of control three ten over one Ninety\nFive or something and it would be up there and then it would come back and they were trying very hard to every ... wasn't responding his body wasn't responding to anything that they were giving him\nSo we know when they when they\nGot to this point they said look at you know Nineteen forty four is rolling around this guy's going to run for president again again\nAnd we've got to get to the bottom with how's it going on here so they send them to the doctor of the day Dr frankly founder of the lead clinic in Boston and he's a surgeon and he is the guy\nIn America at the time so he examines FDR march in Nineteen forty four\nAnd um when he comes out was is is a glaring statement which is now available online you can look it up at the History Channel basically saying that this was a dead man walking\nAnd do what he the laundry list of symptoms that he reveals that FDR has does not aligned with the advance of polio\nThey advance the aligned with the advance of poisoning\nFDR is being slowly poison styling style and got him I can tell you that I'm styling wants FDR out of the picture or at least mentally incapacitated at the altar confidence because he wants to rule the world\nAfter yard he wanted to set up the for policemen of the world um the United states Great Britain China in the Soviet Union so they could all police there a quarter of the world FDR didn't want to share of the world with I'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac with what he didn't Soviet Union\nI'm Sorry Stalin didn't want to share the world with FDR he wanted to rule the world\nHe was a megalomaniac with what he didn't Soviet Union of course we didn't know that that wasn't wasn't you know reveal to us until years later\nWho wants it they died that was part of the negotiation team in the U.S at ... ... on the way back from the all time or one of Roosevelt aids died conveniently also on the brain in your resume\nBut there are people dropping dead around FDR of rain any resumes all over the place that no one writes about again no one writes about those are his name was ... and he was a high ranking naval officer he was on the way back I Believe in that

bathing everything around us\nSo we we surveyed this question about two thousand people and found once again that politics really aren't as important to people as we thought if you sort of ask them this question about you know thinking about your own identity which parts of your identity are most important to you\nIt's interesting because if you found out I guess from the surveys you say in the

you\nKnow how many days you're in school they just want you you know the you know to be in a school for the year for a thousand eighty hours or whatever\nAnd there are some states that still do base it on how many days you're in school and those are the states that it's a bit harder to go to four day on those states because they look at days instead of ours the ones that look at our says you know we don't care what your schedule is just make sure your kids you know\nHave this many hours of instruction for the year\nI Would think that there would be some opposition to this plan from parents who have to scramble around to find care for their kid on that in the day\nYeah and that's always the big issue daycare daycare on that day\nAnd uh what I found is a lot of these districts that go to a four day\nThey typically have something in place rather they open up some of the schools on that friday and they offer like a discount at day care and some of them actually offer free daycare or there's nonprofits that have like relatively cheap daycare and the and the school district might provide the meals\nAre to those nonprofit certain in some cases the school district actually might open up on that friday just to serve milk because there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting\nYou know during the during the school day period so a daycare has been a really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the district seat a use for day\nAnd and talking to those parents there are a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but then they just\nA use for day and and talking to those parents there are a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it but didn't they just they

I've looked at study after study in ...\nFrom what I could see academics just based on these studies academics are not suffering under the four day and there's actually school districts that say that they notice higher test scores because the kids just come back well rested and ready to learn and they're missing fewer days so they're in school or that's how that's how they feel\nUm but academics we haven't really seen studies that show that\nKids do horrible it just seems to be like\nYou know academics really just don't seem to be suffering right now according to these studies\nThis weekend's
