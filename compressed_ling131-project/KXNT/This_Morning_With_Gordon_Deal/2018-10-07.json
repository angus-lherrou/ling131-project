fact that ... sort of thought about this all up to the site things that are around\n... works better real mountains\nA you know three thousand six hundred year old burial mountains of Neolithic these off work so I don't know whether you have them\nIn the states but we've got 'em all over the u._k. and you do find a link to UFO related sightings and an even alien big tax cuts which I'm native to the u._k. lots of things are seen around these works and I don't think\nIt's it's by chance I think ... probably pull these sites of great importance of what you would consider greats importance on

all from that first session of these sightings of what's been to the full extent well we'll have another\nOne of the early science themes I got was a from a farmer who has a from a coke bridge from it's a place called I think he's beginning to just down to flicks them and he told me that is not this is not some terrifying accountable nevertheless it's interesting he told me that\nAs a young boy fourteen or Fifteen Years old he worked with a an elderly fama Kate and Kate and he's only a mile away from flakes them Coney across across the the drive to the lake bed\nOr on the edge of the the ... the stock or a Catholic interestingly people is spelled C a double a ass\nAn eight means wetland so it's nothing to do with a ... so he said that he worked for they sold ... who was elderly then when

poor within hat on the case in jobs it's scenic warms\nClaimed that his father at sea and its and his grandfather it's seen it on that one that was that sort of an historic sign team from Jimmy ... you know going back to the Nineteen forties ... will probably so even earlier than that probably in the Nineteen twenties they Jimmy Case guy a and\nThey're not talking about something hugely most skillet from what I can gather out of the stories and then to stay Nineteen forty eight we can just about they they ... there's a series of burial mountains at the top of ...\nAnd uh so close together that they would if they form if emerge them they would still be a small village\nAnd and these these young boys aged about eleven at the time and [noise] [noise] [noise]\nHello oh did you realize what that\nI I honestly thought my phone that exploded that was written\nUp [laughter] right let me tell you I'm not a stranger thought I was going to be out of speaking to your\nSkin\nFreebie now that\nI

they\nCame through the back of the phone to my ear sounded like I don't know anyway\nWell and the crazy thing to just fill every money no down there that you know he um he studies all sorts of things so you know lights in the sky lights coming from the water you last night people and you know he's got all sorts of things going on so\nUsually a lot of times saw when when when like truth comes out yes sometimes\nOther things trying to think so just classic classic stuff so anyway go ahead he gave me a little scared when I heard that you know\nWe haven't been off 'cause I thought so much going on with phone but not so that's cool I'm\nCourse it's over so jumping out now Nineteen forty eight there's a series of burial mountains or the ... and ... and ... called shop how is that how means burial mountain listeners hate vote ... W E\nAnd these young boys in proximity Nineteen thirty eight or ... that one slate summer's evening\nThey were both raised about eleven one of them's passed away now they're the ones still with us who lives in the village\nAnd um they were playing and they will put on these burial mountains and they said if you know it was a time when you could sort of people got the doors unlocked there was not the crime that there is now in\nChildren could play out late and do something to do what they wanted and it was sort of a late summer evening nine of them they're approaching the burial mound of shop how\nI was a huge tree growing out to the side of the burial mountains and it's still that today because there are a little bit of filming only a few weeks ago\nAnd they claimed that this creature was sort of scripted down on his horn shoes looking up something in his hands and they definitely said hands and there are these are flaws\nThey couldn't say out toilet ... pain if it to the ... they would have said it was well over six foot so well essentially ... the head on like ... an ounce Asians than in the covered in hair ... so to the features of of a of a dog at\nA mixture of both and they're still looking at this thing not very close to the ... they're looking to and they can't believe what they're looking at the very slowly\nIt lifted his head it will be looking at something and they said he's homes and look to them now they didn't say a glowing red eyes or anything like that now they tuned and run\nAs fast as they couldn't they went off on the heels on the way home now this thing never pursue them now that's another thing that makes me think I mean we've been looking at an apex predator here and it's ... kind of\nI don't know that that kind of reaction when he sees what would the ultimately be pray and he did nothing now the story\nAll those years they these jobs I mean this guy do now who would relate today and when I first went round buried affliction in probably\nAnd uh if you go to our website there's some really great sketches\nFrom some of the a witness\nTestimonies of what was seen and we were just talking\nPreviously with Paul about the uh werewolf that was seen holding something and if you go to the site you'll see featured a these sketches that Paul did by the way as an artist as well and chess just when you see it when you see it coming to life\nLost someone you know drawn it it's a it really adds so much to the story from the witnesses now POM Wonderful artist uh sketching that you did I Know that you're an artist as well and a former carpenter\nAnd so now what you do you like to ... year retired and you enjoy going and checking out all these mysteries correct\nThat's correct on it yeah it seems to be\nPassionate about all my life due to my early vote on the things that I explained nature shall we say and I'm just in a position now where can I can support all my time into the race or the truth from folks I Know just about ... so we've gone missing\nTo know what I couldn't I couldn't support all my time into the research the truth proof books and not just about ... so we've gone missing people want explained light

filmmakers ... releasing a film dog mine relates a big ... relate to cold elusive which is going to be quite incredible ... you know for me\nNo no no no no no no you're so monsters great but\nYou know I'm I Want to know more of those things because it was really tough soon to tell everybody out there and then how tough it was that in a meeting on hearing about talking with Paul\nI'm that it was really hard to narrow down what should we talk about because I can talk about this on and on and not just like you and\nAnd you also like just study all sorts of things and pulling together so it was very difficult to go holy cow literally pull down for a couple hours and really focus in on so that's where the horse you know we are talking about the where Wilson is perfect for right now\nFor the time they definitely want to bring you back on with all these other wonderful things so yeah go ahead and let you get back to where we'll stories um\nNeed such old old stories of the ...\nThat's

right\nYeah I mean if it's not so we're we're going to use for twenty yeah get ... you know this this definitely there's got to be some reason because otherwise we wouldn't have such ...\nSuch gaps

what's being done to fix them we're joined now by cyber security journalist Kim Zetter who's got a piece running in the New York times and what's the current security level\nIt's really what I Would refer to his band aids security there were really not in a much of a different shape and we weren't she doesn't sixteen there are some some some differences some changes but certainly not um ah what you would want\nWell what are the band aid by the way which was which work backwards I guess\nSo um what's a VHS did prior to doesn't fix it reached out to states and it I'm offered this scanning service that it does\nUm what this means is it simply will scan the Internet facing system to these where they um the servers like the voter registration um databases things like that anything that's on line\n... will do this remote scan 'em and all it's doing is looking to see if you have any um open software vulnerability is better knowing supper rolling believe that we know about that I'm also have a patch available\nAnd it will tell the states where it's found a vulnerability and um it will keep scanning they will keep scanning like on a weekly basis on a bi weekly basis to see when the um the customer has a patch that system\nSo they did that to a few states before um the two thousand six months and then they've done that to more states are more counties now\nUm since then but it's still the the amount is I think it's a less than half\nUm and the scanning is really a sort of cosmetic it's getting at only the intimate facing system could not getting at the core back and systems they're supposedly not connected to the Internet has not getting at the voting machines at all not looking at the core vulnerabilities there\nAnd it's often not touching um what are the election management systems and these are the systems that sit in a county headquarters a there used to program their voting machines and they're also used to tabulate devote so these are actually the most critical systems not the Internet they think this them\nLet's talk about um the victims you actually know the person which seems to be somewhat often if that person is a friend of relatives employing

... if money is dot com is put together a list of ways to spot fake reviews can you hear about the boulders ones\nA lot of them are fake it's really hard these days to tell me to be easier right you would just see something it didn't it was garbled and just had five stars and it was garbled and you knew that that would say that's not really true anymore they're not people hired you just write reviews and they're getting very good at it\nUm but there was a survey that found that about eight and ten people say that they read a fake review in the past year I'm an eighty four percent of them say hey I don't even know if I can always spot fake review\nSo I just thought you know this is an opportunity to really dig into what is a research showing what experts say\nAbout um spotting fake reviews for the first one which I'm not sure I realized but I'm examined the timing of reviews if you see a lot you're looking at a product Amazon wherever you're looking at it you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time\nThat can be a sign that it's those are fake reviews\nUm that is because there's a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a bunch a new review that often happens in a short amount of time so if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if they're if the product just launched and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the same time but again just be suspicious about that\nOr how about the um the accusation or the rest of the nation and Amazon doing that a newer payoffs right to delete bad reviews All right\nSo that they are investigating that were not entirely sure if that actually happened they are investigating that they were um that some of its employees mostly in China um we're taking bribes\nTo delete negative reviews and share sales data on banned band account there was a bunch of that now they're investigating it we don't know\nIf it's true or not but you know I mean that immediately when I read that I thought wow there's a lot of the reviews who knows what's going on here but it's a problem because you were people rely on reviews to to you know what they buy and\nIf they're fake I mean you're you're ... you're not going to like when you end up with it when it ended up in your health\nWe'll speak with video editor at ... dot com or talk about how to spot fake reviews online or in another way you said over use of the words are you and me and lots of verbs\nThis was a huge study coming out of Cornell that found um that online reviews that frequently use by and me are more likely to beef steak they don't exactly know why\nBut it could be because when people are lying they try to make themselves sound more credible by using personal pronouns or they're saying I Need to make it seem like they're they're real person doing this\nUm and then they are they also found that ... years more verbs and then um they more verbs in truth tellers and truth tellers use more now and\nThat's a little bit harder I think to parse out but the guy in the me if you see a whole bunch of that that's a a little bit of a red flag\nWhat's the scene setting you gotta watch out for this is another thing from that they caught out that e okay so that's when I was looking\nAt a hotel in particular but I think it probably applied to everything\nThat truthful hotel where you are more likely to use concrete word so they'll say something like\nBathroom check and you know very concrete things that people who were aligned fake reviews they were more
