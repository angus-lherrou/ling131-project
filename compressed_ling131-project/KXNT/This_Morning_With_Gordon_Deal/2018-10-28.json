I didn't\nInto this in the book but I think it's true I don't believe in divorce can murders would ... would ever have happened when they did have the light spin on and the reason that was true is that he had committed another atrocity of just six days earlier about a hundred miles away\nAnd he normally would not have\nA head another outraged that quickly but because the lights the city was plunged into darkness it was a perfect opportunity for him and he couldn't pass it up anyway ... um\nUh the two little girls named Ida Lena still under went home with a more family the family of Henry More they walked home after the church service and and the little girls spent the night with the their friend the little girl was a member of the family\nOn the morning of June can no one is starting around in the house the um and the uh uh\nHis brother finally comes to break into the house finds a couple of bodies and runs out of the house scraping they bring the town marshal and he\nHis name as as a tank Horton Mr Horton courageously goes through the house\nYou have to understand he has no reason to believe anything other than that uh a craze murderer is hiding somewhere in this house here and there is a dark house or he's holding matches in front of him\nOr with no gun to no form of protection holding matches in front of a in front of his own himself going from room to room finding bodies\nAnd then to no form of protection holding matches in front of a in front of his um self going from room to room finding bodies their eight dead bodies in the house and like if my log house in a small quiet Midwestern town\nThe um [noise] uh and all of them hitting the head with an axe\nThe access found as it usually is next to the body of a little girl the man from the train was a it was a pervert to him he was interested in little little girls and the little girl was usually found in a in an attitude suggesting that she had been\nA she had been outraged after that they um [noise] uh\nIn any case the crime was not there was a a great uproar is you can imagine but the crime was not solved a two years later a con man named Jay and walk her son came to Alaska\nAnd realized that he could sustain a phony investigation of the crime\nBy keeping people angry he could keep donations coming in by keeping people angry a ... and he did that by using a a very prominent local citizen Frank Jones of finance through the crimes\nThere isn't any chance in the world the Frank Jones was guilty or that he hadn't any any connection to it but this campaign to prosecute Frank Jones a divided bulldoze a in a horrible and unprecedented way the city fought over whether or not Jones did or didn't do it\nFor several years uh and became a K better badly divided community you know families on one side of the line wouldn't play with\nFamilies on the other side of the line they wouldn't go that they wouldn't shop if their stores they wouldn't uh wouldn't have anything to do with them that this battle lasted in Alaska for even though\nA\nWilkerson was eventual they run out of town in Nineteen Seventeen the uh um the battle went on for a long time\nAnd the hard feelings emanating from it persisted in the city I Would I Would say for two extent that they persisted the present day\n[noise] you know you mentioned the piece about the the person whipping up sentiment in making a false accusation to profit from it\nAnd even that creates a pattern for all too often how\nUm crime stories unsolved claim stories are treated yet yeah it's the same time it it speaks to the fact that there weren't cold case\nPolice officers working the the crime still the crimes have been at that time might have been solved by after that period of time by somebody writing a letter consenting or somebody knowing somebody but\nBut it wasn't meant to almost literally like fall in their lap which again comes back to the the power of storytelling and how he just my keeping my telling a story to beginning middle and end\nAll of these events it doesn't matter how will the story is is that it it will get people to listen again into reconsider again and most likely to connect again\nTo that sense of outrage about what had happened and so you know a static police report won't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right and and and they do that but\nWon't necessarily you know anger people but when you start telling the story again people certainly yeah yeah that's right and and and they do that but also keeps kind of the idea of the murder alive it it makes it it gives you a sensation again it is it that is you know the core\nSensationalism but it does it make it shouldn't make you feel it again the fact that this crime in happened\n... had they had they built a you know any kind of memorial to the family had there been any had there been what had the town done to try\nTo come to grips with the fact that this murder had happened prior to even this con men coming to town there afterwards\nThey um [noise] uh ... well there was I don't know that there was that type of sound about I don't know that anyone built a memorial to the uh um for many years the bullets are\nAuthorities and I would say that still true today that pay the the chamber of commerce tribes types in Politico wish the bullets go was known for something else right right the er at ... there is a house for the crime occurred\nIs still standing of his operated as a kind of more tourism or it's the it's a shows up on paranormal ... TV shows and people pay to take tours of the house\nThe um uh but if you drive around ... there's no sign anywhere that says where the houses are now that we at science thing where the doctors houses but that but uh whether ... what ... is known for is not mentioned anywhere\nThe um uh that's not an appropriate I I I it goes without saying that that's not an appropriate memorial on the um uh I don't know that you raise an interesting question I don't know that in any of these cases there was a a\nProper memorial to the victims victims were mostly poor people mostly people without\nA without one and the more family was very well like they are and the community uh thought well all of them and the vigorous efforts to solve the crime wore a kind of memorial to them uh but I don't think there was any physical memorial to\nYou know sometimes it's just a place where somebody always brings flowers ... where there is an effort to try to so just enough to be like a statue\nBut it's interesting how communities will will sometimes do that because that that is their way of honoring so but I think you mentioned economic speech none explains everything you know that that's one of the reasons why it's usually prominent citizens that enjoy that kind of it's done is not a you know\nThe um the one of his rather than maps of trades crimes with the double murder and Colorado Springs it murder two families in one night and joining out the ah ah but if you if you go to that\nCommunity where that happened now the people that area's still remember it still they they could tell yeah oh that's a house right there um but it still has not forgotten or many\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nBill James the co author of the men from the train to research with his daughter Rachel McCarthy James and by the way when I read more carefully on the back cover it does say that she lives with her husband not you [laughter] so so I got the wrong\nUm but you should be very proud of the work that you all did together not every father daughter team can do that kind of thing\nUh you looked at these ah you looked at these murders and you put them in these different pockets you know the percentage that you believed were clearly done by the men from the train and then well there's others that might be likely that he did but you couldn't prove that\nUm or ones that are very unlikely but the the shared some characteristics which should also really inform us as to\nHow many unsolved murders\nWere going on back then we think that some sort of modern phenomenon but it certainly isn't right\nRight well the murder of entire family and what about is is that it was them it is now but uh uh there were very very unsolved murders in that era\nIs it is a rare of that it was then and it is now but uh uh there were many many unsolved murders in that era\nYou know it means even as you mentioned they just weren't any investigative bodies and if they had one wouldn't the investigation wouldn't last for long is it wasn't a lot of funding\nBut Joe is let let's let's go down this path of of the process that you used to try to actually\nNarrowed down to a name to a person I've I've seen this done a couple of times right there's been some very interesting attempts to to to name names with regard to Jack the ripper for example is an including going through ships registries and finding whether or not there was a particular sailor\nThat coincided with the murders and white chapel and or other parts of the world\nThat shared similar characteristics as the the crimes in in England but it happened in Central America or happened in in ...\nAnd so they were able to trying to find you know well this sailor went from this poor to that port in in each one of these ports there was a murder so it's it into it but if you have to have to START I mean it's not quite a needle in a haystack but it's\nIt's at least maybe um\nYou know to to look at it broadly you're you're you don't even know yet what you don't know when you start doing the search like this so you you don't you know is it even possible that a name could even be found\nGiven the scarcity of information about you know people are public registries during that period\n... intervention the Jack the ripper case I Am I read I have read probably twenty bucks citing jak river was this guy or jak forever was that guy or\nThe or and I and my other book popular crime I made fun of the people who wrote those books um the uh uh because I don't\nI don't have much confidence that you can actually do that and to be Frank almost all of the arguments that Jack the ripper is this guy or that guy almost all of them are silly they um I never really expected that we would find it convincing argument\nAbout who this who was doing this so I mean we were looking gas and Rachel says that she did expect to find them but I didn't they um uh but when we walk the crimes back or are there is a crime in Massachusetts and Eighteen Ninety eight that\nRachel says the moment she saw it she knew it was him the um uh and that was because I had told her that this guy wouldn't make mistakes and in his first crime he did make numerous mistakes that let everybody know who he was\nThe uh uh but the number of details that match up in the first crime to let's say Alaska is is just it's beyond anything that you would\nYou would a suspect was a could be coincidence and I'll I'll mentioned just a few\nThings yeah please do you want me to give you the name or not it doesn't\nMatter you know we will go through the coincidence or go through the the similarities first\nWell ... the first crimes that were\nSort of publicly link where crimes in the Portland area and two crimes and the Portland area where we're committed rather obviously by the same man and that the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this is the same guy whether that crime a month ago down south Portland\nAnd the the tech the same detectives happen to be investigating him and thought this was the same guy I mean is that crime a month ago down south part of the um uh\nThat criminal had size six feet the um there's another crime in Maine in Nineteen oh two in which the criminals they wish there were a pair of boots prince that were central to the trial\nA again side of six feet is a very uh the the so we we know that this is a small man well it is recorded about man that we found that he did in fact have size six feet\nNot speculation he did we know that we ... it was believed that he was small because\nI'm the or a ... and in other places\nWhen he swung the acts the ceiling was very low the ceiling is only about seven feet high in the room where the murders were committed but when he swung the axe over his head he just barely grazed the ceiling if a person of normal size a person of\nA if a person a large man could not swing an axe over his head in that room without sticking it in the ceiling because of that it was believed that he had to be small he was five foot for the uh uh\nIt was suspected if you look at the blood pattern the way the blood flies off the ax you could say clearly rather it's the guys basically left handed or to basically right hander that's a pretty easy thing to see\nIt was believed that the murder and Alaska was left handed\nThe man who committed the crime and Eighteen Ninety eight was left handed we had said that he had to be a well the first stories about him say that he was an experience trap than he would travel around the nation on trains for a while and then he would settled down into an area [noise]\nWe had said that he must work as a longer because all the crimes\nFor about ten years occur and logging areas the first story about him first stories about him specifically say that he was an experience the longer the uh uh the nature of the crime itself the special attention to the\nA ... girl a that was there in the first crime in the first cry he always killed the man of the house first and the a and ended with the murder of a young girl that's what he did and first crime\nThe he always used the blunt side of the X. oh you'd never even I wouldn't say it I Can't say he never killed anyone with a sharp ... backs but it was always\nHis intention to use the blunt side of the acts in this first crime blunt side of the acts and as he would do in Alaska and many other places he left the acts on the floor beside the young girls that the uh so the crime just matches up on too many points\nFor you to think that this isn't him\nSo then she started to look for science would bore left handed and filed knickers ... I didn't even longer ax murderer\nOr ... ... well\nHow did you begin to narrowly name out of that\nWhen he committed first crime he it was obviously ... who when he first crime is obvious who had committed this because he was living with the family which that's a common thing\nIt was obvious so he ... when it first crime is obvious who had committed it because he was living with the family which that's a common thing at a cereal murders first crime he often kills people to home and he is directly connected and\nCan be tied so we killed the first family an Eighteen Ninety eight everybody knew who who have done it because he fled the scene and I would say they were looking for it just it all of these other facts about the first about the criminal happened to line up with what we were looking for\nAnd the name that you believe is a ... ... the man on the train\nThe ... the name that he was using there was all Miller the weather that we could watch it ... it was a German immigrant or the or whether that was his actual name or not um there's speculation he could have been using a false maybe even that however there's no real reason to believe he was\nWe found that I shouldn't say we found a friend of mine doing research on his own after the book was published found the uh the the ships record in which he entered the country about an Eighteen Ninety the um are are probably a man named Paul Miller had entered the country\nI'm On a ... he was he walked with a sailors gate he you know if it was more like it and\nThen walk side to side with the uh uh and the uh uh uh they they were so if he had been in the German army a German Navy so ah they found the ship within which became what came into the okay\nAdel born and often stand in harm's way to fight for our freedom which some giving the ultimate sacrifice I'm Erin tailor the real estate guy and I am Nevada proud ... corporation with a better broadcasters association the mistakes of\nThe sleep condition common injury and even get to him since\nThe baby on a cell phone in a chair or they don't get the baby you love from becoming a tragic stitches the only safe place for your baby to sleep is alone on back to create an in your room for more information dizzy cribs for kids dot org trips for\nKids dot org didn't sponsored by the public and behavioral health care to cooperation\nWithin about a broadcasters association and the station\nAdjusted the heart of a home loan studios K.

surprised to learn that some haunted houses in Syria experiences are not just Halloween events that are actually opened a thrill seekers year round\nThat's true and that's what's so crazy about this world is you know obviously we have these things like universal studios horror nights every year but there's this group of people that for them that's just not enough and they're just looking for the three hundred and sixty five days a year\nYou mentioned heritage in Los Angeles and it's one of the leaders in extreme haunts what goes on and heretic\nMan it's pretty crazy I'll say that first of all I'll have to admit I'm not a huge horror fan but I spent six hours at\nA hair to ... so I feel like I really really weren't in it and it was almost a rite of passage for me to watch people go through this but everyone's experience was completely different that something that was really interesting the scare actors\nBasically kind of size somebody up as they come in and they can read to see it they're going to be more afraid if you know they grab them from the front or grab them from behind I mean\nOne woman had a plastic bag put over her head she was rash around in the air they threw a cardboard box on top of her raped across it it with a rake and then\nThe guy punch through the box grabbed her neck I mean everyone's experience was different but I've heard of people being stimulated

happens it's just next level next level\nYou wrote about one guy who was visiting extreme haunts forty four times though one recently the event included within stripped boxers and curled into fetal position taken mud straw unseemly to body fluids his first words afterwards that was awesome\nExactly so that was the one that I was out and you know it was interesting because this took place out in the middle of the desert and they said it was kind of an extra central space crisis so people arrived they were blindfolded they were led to this dusty RV\nThey were stripped of their clothes and put in this distress face you and they were told that they were these criminals that had been on the bottom eyes and that they would be walking around the property collecting\nBlood samples and trying to identify a couple of bodies that were there\nAnd they were given a walkie talkie there was this does embodied voice that was super creepy that was walking him through all of them is that they were supposed to make and they walked through this property and there's fog and smoke everywhere as they walk in there is a man let on fire running around screaming\nAll these different actors encounter them and torture them and scare them in their own unique ways and\nThey ended up in this tent in the back\nIn the pitch black with all this fog and this man is monster with a mask just pops out of nowhere and starts rationing them around and rich the spacesuit off strips them down to their underwear and is just smearing this simulated bodily fluids goo and vomiting on their chest\nHuh that's been down to their underwear\nAnd is nearing emulated bodily fluid goo and vomiting on their chest and yeah so the majority of these protests are going to that end up in the position in their underwear and what was the whole area is about it is that you know I'm watching this thinking\nWow they they must be really shaken up and they are but as they make the walk back off that property in kind of transition back into normal life they're so excited they would give it again they're telling me that he's memory they're going to last a lifetime\nFor the actors I guess there are some rules that these three months\nYeah they're not allowed to actually hurt the people one of the guys was kind of funny and he told me that his only rules are basically don't kill then don't permanently scarred then\nBut um you know they actually got physically which is funny I mean you go to places like universal studios time and you know they pop out and I think a lot of them having no touching
