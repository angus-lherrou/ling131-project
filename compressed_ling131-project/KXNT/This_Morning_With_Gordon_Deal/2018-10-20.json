and then on top of it we we did another thing called aero barrier to make sure that we we controlled infiltration unbelievably I'll get back to the minute right so you got to make the place where the ...\nThen you got to be able to make some electricity so we put Eighteen solar panels on this brilliantly designed garage which just is behind the building away so nobody sees it it's perfect NGO\nTelevision show this old house you can follow the progress on line at this old house dot com and catch the latest episode on your local PBS station\nAnd if all this talk of home remodeling has you thinking about your next project you can call in your home improvement question now to one eighty they money pit presented by home advisor dot com\nWell this project involve both remodeling of a one hundred year old building in the building a brand new addition bringing those two together was the job or next guests Jeff swinger welcome just thank you\nNow you do a lot of building the Narragansett area and then we have a lot of summer houses here that we're probably never intended to be your own residences and and here we are putting heating systems in them and air conditioning and\nAnd insulation and trying to make it all work in this case you had even a tougher job because you had to make this net zero so that it basically\nEssentially made all the energy that it needed now to do that you need to rely on a lot of systems with one of which was the insulation still talk to me about his legend that made it possible here\nYou know as you said this was a summer cottage are designed a you know in the Nineteen twenties or so where you had some structural framing members that were only geared to support you know the roof load itself right a now today's standards with the insulation in the energy codes\nWe've got to make room for insulation or they might say that he's not even a\nSo we had to do a combination of insulated from the inside with super high a fish and stuff like\nClothes so a spray foam right then we also had to insulate on the exterior of the building so we added to the outside just as much as we added to the inside because we didn't have all room on the inside right now they advantage to to adding to the outside is that you create that thermal barrier\nAround the the framing members which are much more conducted transfer heat also\nSo that was a critical part of this project\nOr will barrier around the the framing members which are much more productive and transfer heat also\nSo that was a critical part of this project you know to the inside the finish I had a chance to walk through the house earlier just amazing carpentry in this job you guys that are really terrific uh works here with all the detail in the trends in ceilings and stuff to talk about ah\nWell ah I give credit to the architect on powers who are really just thought about every space in the house and took advantage of his expertise and the design world and and really created a masterful\nA depiction of of water cottage built in you know cozy atmosphere would be in a you know all we did was follow his lead in a and execute a but I I give credit to him he he took advantage of every single corner in the house\nSo sounds it was a good partnership and unusual for you to have the architect is the home or you're killing his wife has the designer\nYeah well it was it was really a little bit intimidating to start with that because um I you know held to a little bit of a higher standard has left up to it it really turned out to be a really mutual relationship you know we collaborated on a lot of things Don wasn't a\nSo you know a meal to already you know right we were able to exchange ideas and um they were right down the road so it eliminated a third party and the middle so it really really did work out well\nBut as you say communication really is key now the exterior this home had a lot of work done landscape you hit a landscape architect helping with that but ah you had to organize that part of the construction as well what was the challenge\nWhile the challenge was a it was a short period of time where we had to make a lot of things happen and we had three different porches which uh\nYou know cascaded down into the hearts gate and then we had a really extensive landscape plan you know it caught me by a little bit by surprise but when they started bringing the trees and the plants and I was amazed at how many plant things we ended up having\nAnd then they the landscape architect Tom Ryan did just a wonderful job that segment in different areas around the yard which are all\nMeaningful and well planned in a you know it it it came together\nWe can't wait to see rollout Jeff sweeter the builder on this project thanks so much for stopping by the money that that was my pleasure you can follow along with all the progress here in Jamestown online at this old house dot com or on Twitter and Facebook has tacked tear wage Jamestown\nWell the team is this old house didn't get all the work done here themselves they had to help in the form of to apprentices selected after a nationwide search Mary Smith from two below Mississippi and Kevin Baker from right here\nIn Rhode Island welcome Mary and Kevin thank you so this was a pretty interesting opportunity for you guys to kind of step right in here to the ... school of remodeling and ah and help out in a really exciting project how did you get picked Mary Let's start with you\nI sit naked and video on line right and gathered references and I shut it down some marketed I had done on my own house and it's nice to nice dance prior to that says India I lie and\nYeah and I see that that was because you bought a house and needed some works you you figure out how to do it and that's where you started right\nRight right it's a on a Nineteen sixties ranching learning arraigned Iran\nVery cool and Kevin you've been in the construction trade here for a little while in Rhode Island kind of projects did you do know mostly renovations additions to the company I Love that\nThe construction trade here for a little while\nIn Rhode Island all kinds of projects did you do mostly renovations additions company I Love that you describe yourself and your audition tape as the\nQuote balance a perfect deficiency in quality says this guy's got confidence that was a good description yeah it was a good description that you get that from the marine corps the balance of the efficiency and quality yeah it was it was definitely something I'd probably picked up some good traits in the marine corps and help out with\nWhat kinds of experience did you gather working here on this project I got thrown into a lot of different projects that I haven't ever touched before like doing a western red cedar Ruth I write in her I've never read their inch cap\nBefore that was a new experience for me the whole uh insulation layers insulation in a ... ... panels for this house rude or something that I had never touch before so there are few different or new experiences\nAnd marry you grew up in lumber yard to understand your father your grandfather were ah were in the lumber business\nYeah my grandfather and I find that right past a lumber brokers cell phone there in him in that environment\nWhen you were working on your own house um what kinds of projects were you tack went and did that work translate to some of the stuff that you saw here\nYeah we did a bathroom rented nation and our own house and and then a higher plane and go to the living room and just as carpentry skills and able to carry with me here\nAnd you also had a cake business I heard that dead is still vegan yeah actually ... that are that way to\nGet to the to to get to the to the crews are now like Kevin I understand that you have an assistant that follows you around your dog Sophie I\nDo yeah and uh she's best work site dog I've ever seen so she uh she's been come with me more or less after I got done filming um when I stayed with swimming and she's been back at the job site fade and day out now you\nGuys you answered the call for practices you know to kind of get on here on the site and get the experience of these guys had to offer you a there were probably hundreds at least of those tapes and came in and what was it like to get the call the email it was that moment like for you guys once you start getting\nTook a minute for it to sink in [laughter] yeah I uh I actually thought that I didn't get it because the the uh contact us about a week after when they told us that we're going to know his cage and right\nAnd then a center called me and told me that we got it and those kind of a kind of taken back by well you know it was a good a good experience and a road that hired for a couple of ... and and married thirty seconds or what was it like for you\nAnd and I kind of little\n[laughter] ... yeah never imagined it right all the\nWhile you're representing a lot of young people that are interested in the building trades and I know that you've been a great example for those and inspired those that are thinking about getting into this themselves so\nThanks for your efforts I'm really happy with you guys and now you guys have a degree from this old house university to brag about yeah great experience you are a marriage that Kevin Barker thank you so much for

trying to come home\nYou are listening to the money that home improvement show coming to you today on location from Jamestown Rhode Island the site of the current project on this these forty season of America's most popular home improvement show this old house and one of the guys\nWho's been part of the fabric of this old house for over twenty five years is general contractor Tommy soda you just keep getting younger don't\nYou tell yeah [laughter] well almost thirty five years there wow five thirty six years I mean yeah man it's amazing I hearing them down in the first few years [laughter] white played hard to get I ... well maybe that's it\nThat way but it turned it down because I worked for my dad we would just do my dad he didn't want any part of the details anyway but now would you be ready\nTo act on TV and stuff so I Want to talk with you I'm first about the fact that a lot of the construction here was pre fabricated and I think when people think prefab or fact rebuilt it take well maybe it's not as good as what you could do my hand but that's not really the case here and and ... you weren't specifically to things that you did hear that we're it's fascinating to me\nThe foundation first she said oh you can make everything in the house but you can't make the foundation\nNow you know you guys actually got a foundation three hundred miles away and brought it here they bring in ... well\nFree casts foundation it insulated it and it has a concrete reinforced steel reinforced studying it they're insulated so there's no thermal breaking that in that position and the studs up free drilled for the electrician to run his wires through and it's a fast efficient way to put a foundation\nThey should and the studs a free drilled for the electrician to run his wires through and it's a fast efficient way to put a foundation and that's basically waterproof at the same time\nWhile in the building that we're in right now this is actually the garage that it probably the nicest garage out you've ever seen right but this was factory billed as well so is this a pre cut building well you put it together everything's caught\nOn a on a CNC saw yeah so you know what's going to fit exactly right you know what the puzzle together and you've got a beautiful barn that looks like it was built onsite\nNow the challenge on this property was building at the net zero which means that basically has to be so tight so well insulated and uh so perfectly heated um that it it essentially makes all the energy needs to operate that involved a lot of different types of inflation or want to ask you about that because I I think it's unusual to see spray foam used to different types of Springfield open\nAnd close close and then you had sold ... million which are actually I Love that insulation I mean I think of it is it's basically rock writes funding to fight it molten rock radio\nAnd and and you it's a great insulation for sounded need for insulation and its water resistant well you know if it gets wet it's going to dry out\nNow you guys use a technique called warmer blanket on the exterior walls what does that mean well\nThat's where you take the insulation the the\nStone will insulate right now you can also use rigid phone and you apply it to the exterior surface of the building so you framed the building in this case we had the old building we had to deal with the conventional walls right those will spray foam on the outside of the sheeting you have to put a thermal barrier\nBecause you have to worry about the thermal bridging of the structure when it when it meets that\nDifferent installations so in other words it could be some transfer of different temperature\nFrom the actual study ... and so you got to worry about condensation forming on the inside of the outside insulation\nIs that makes sense is that where does enter the sandwich right so in other words you're putting something like a um it's it's called like a house wrap that you put on before you put your installation on it's like a range screens you know of any any condensation should occur in between that insulation it will run down and not damage that she\nWas actually has to be completely storm only separated get ... yeah it's almost like when you're building sounded the buildings you put separate walls and never touch the same idea here which are firmly separating everything's good shape and insulation\n... exactly right yeah that's the trick\nNow you also had to install the solar right which is on this building and you also have a beautiful wood shingle roof here now which single roof ... if they're not done right and I've seen an awful lot of them and do you have to their ... like crazy say\nRye fast if they're not you you have to ... you have to think of that ... ... today is not like which was say fifty two hundred years ago right the wood that you get\nFrom lumber is really farmed", "show_name": "This Morning With Gordon Deal", "year": "2018",
