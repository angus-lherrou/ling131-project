explain\nThat a lot of them are fake it's a really hard these days to tell me to be easier right you would just see something it didn't it was garbled and just had five started and it was garbled and you knew that that would say that's not really true anymore they're not people hired to just write reviews and they're getting very good at it\nUm but there was a survey that found that about eight and ten people say that they read a sacred view in the past year I'm an eighty four percent of them and say hey I don't even know if I can always spot\nFake review so I just thought you know this is number two unity to really dig into what is a research showed what experts say\nAbout um the spotting fake reviews for the first one which I had not try realize but I'm the exam and the timing of reviews if you see a lot you're looking at a product Amazon wherever you're looking at it you see a lot of reviews pop in a short amount of time that can be a sign that those are fake reviews\nUm that is because there are a lot of times there's a targeted campaign to add a bunch a new review that often happens in a short amount of time so if you see a whole bunch clustered together that can be fake I mean of course if there is a product just launched and it was a Black Friday or Christmas or something like that that might be why there's a lot of the same time but again just be suspicious about that\nWell we're speaking with Katie Hill editor at ... dot com or talking about how to spot fake reviews on line or how about the um the accusations are the best of Amazon doing that a newer payoffs right to delete bad reviews All right\nSo that they are investigating that were not entirely sure if that actually happened they are investigating that they were on it some of its employees mostly in China um we're taking bribes\nTo delete negative reviews and share sales data on banned band account there was a bunch of that and other investigating it we don't know\nIf it's true or not but you know I mean that immediately when I read that I thought wow there's a lot of the reviews who knows what's going on here but it's a problem because you were people rely on reviews to to you know what they buy and\nIf they're fake I mean you're you're ... you're not going to like when you end up with it when it ended up in your house\nOr in another way you said over use of the words are you and me and lots of verbs\nUsing personal pronouns with everything I Need to make it seem like they're they're real person doing this\nUm and then they and they also found that ... more verbs and then I'm In the ... century tailored and to tell her to use more now and that's a little bit harder I think to parse out but the eye and then me if you see a whole bunch of that that's a little bit of a red flag\nOr what's the scene setting you gotta watch out for this\nIs another thing from that they point out that e okay to ... and it was looking at a hotel in particular but I think it probably applied everything truthful hotel where if you are more likely to use concrete word so that was like in the bathroom ...\nAnd then you you gave an example of a job that has gone through with is one of the experience maybe some growing pains but results have been favorable\n[noise] yeah so I mean there are a lot of companies that are just doing this of their own accord whether they see the writing on the wall that this legislation is coming whether they think it's the right thing to do for workers um whether they think there are some um recruitment retention benefits for them and some companies are kind of coming out\nYou for workers or whether they think they're some on recruitment retention benefits for that and some companies are kind of coming out had it before it alive impact them and to\nUm had kind of big pilot study where they implemented scheduling change it in all their stores and then for that kind of went even further and they they did the positive results they thought to
