marketplace Sarah what's happening\nPart of the changes to phone contracts that break out the price of the phone versus the cost of their monthly wireless service I carriers have also become less generous and subsidizing telling\nYou that consumer I left paying the full price so folks are sort of looking at that and looking at the the cost versus the incremental benefits of having the newest device in deciding to hang on to what they had and and make it last a little bit longer\nThan I Would also say that there's black differentiation and kind of a new smart phones that are coming to the

sales and therefore might these phone makers start to\nTurn out cheaper versions or bring back ah you know the the contracts or something\nThat definitely a challenge for smartphone makers because you know for Apple for example the iPhone is responsible for two thirds of its revenues so being able to consistently delivered strong sales that right there as important to have seen some smartphone makers Hansen has brought down for the price says so that they appeal to the more cost conscious\nCustomers are so you see a little bit of application where some of the smartphone makers are willing
