[noise]\nGeneral ... chicken in for Gordon Deal most of us get paid every two weeks but for some that creates financial hardship bucket watches Murray all the money is here with the information on some on demand payment companies that let you decide when you're paid Maria how does this work\nKind of a common problem you know we don't really get certified typically how often we get paid our company decides that\nBut the issue is that so many Americans living paycheck to paycheck um you know you might have an unexpected bill you might have something else come up before your paycheck comes in and you don't have the money right away even though you might have already earned it so now we're seeing these smaller\nElse come up before your paycheck comes in and you don't have the money right away even though you might have already earned it so now we're seeing these smaller companies pop up that are actually helping companies do this [laughter]\nUm or even that you can sign up for individually that will actually give you an advance on your pay check 'em but not as alone more as just you know they might charge you a small fee to give it to you but it's much much less than it would be to get a payday loan or something like that\nWhat kinds of fees are we talking about\nSo one of the company is um it's called the event in their only client right now is Wal Mart but they say they're going to be expanding\nThey charge just six dollar monthly subscription fee which I'm compared to you know the interests that you can pay on a on a payday loan is is relatively small\nUm I Try to another company called daily pay and they said their fees are more similar to an ATM fee and they max out at three dollars so every time you get your paycheck in advance you pay a three dollar fee um which you know is an inexpensive if you do it all the time but it is much much less than some of those interest rates end up being\nMurray as I mentioned in the intro most of us get paid every two weeks and people once a week and some people monthly but why is that generally been a two week paycheck cycle\n[noise] the thing is that actually just a historical precedent um and really there's no technological reason for that I think going into this\nStory I thought you know there must be some tax reason or some\nPayroll reason but there really is and um it's just that companies don't want to pay their employees too often because you know what they have to usually they outsource their payroll to another company and sometimes that's um their contract with that company depends on how many times they have to go through the payroll so\nUm you know if they're doing it all the time they might get charge more\nSo it's really about you know how your company can facilitate payroll but technically there's no reason why you couldn't get paid every single day\nWe're speaking with market watches Maria lasagna Maria how will the gig economy affects how we are paid\nThrough it already is actually um you know ... and left our two companies that compete with each other very um you know strongly for drivers and so one thing that they've both added is the ability to get paid after every ride\n'em they worked with a company called green dot to do that and square um and so now that those\nType of ... workers are used to doing that that has kind of shifted into the you know ... regular payments cycles um you know\nEveryday workers are now saying we I Know someone that gets paid every day or every ride why can't this happened for me so without conversation is already permeating you know a lot of different companies and is kind of increasing the\nPressure to pay workers more frequently\nDo you think the rise of the on demand payment company will somehow forced traditional

there are some very poor communities where that might be the only meal the child might be getting you know during the during the school day period so a daycare has been\nA really big issue but you know and I went to Colorado where a more than fifty percent of the district seat that use for day and and talking to those parents there were a lot of them I talked to that initially did not want it
