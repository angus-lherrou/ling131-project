Richard you made a good point that you were saying the road I mean the road would be an ideal location because if you know worked into the pavement and I know there have been towns little communities and so forth that have done solar panels are interest sidewalk areas correct\nWell but also isn't that just due to the the screens and everything now recording around us all do that also the the vote are you in\nThe ... power density that trees as as as you can prove to buy a ... two or three in the last Twenty years now and he's not going to stop doing that\nCompared to ... to be late ... early on their own in curve\nBut that's known him Kirby coming of Christ he's not coming down on the the prices are coming down as well you ... the lead in about three that's in your phone and that you've seen the cows and that's your some of your with with the power from ... the reason and other technologies solve that tree which is thrilled that trees\nOn this I think that they will take that they saw the big industrial project throw batteries like instead of storing the electricity and Sony states as you would have you know that you know Cal that tree you stories into liquid so thrilled that true yes to two\nPounds a nice job phone on a charge pong and if you want money no gene you just make the ... bigger\nSo that's a technology with cheese evolving very rotating the young that's going to be the lowest cost some ... by far\nSo let me ask you this than what's the hazards\nOf solar solar power solar energy\nOr you are you asking me I Would say very few non ... going to get and they took it said when you when you install it well ...\nIt's funny that you bring that up because ... G v and I were talking earlier and I'm a plumber by trade and I was actually working on a a a wealth pomp at a house that was was solar and I got out by a a ... it's solar panels that we're all hooked up in series yeah you can\nSee that on the D.C power and when you create a spa couldn't see power doesn't go away like your\nRegular out addicts by and I got I got hit by this thing ah let me tell you\nPut me down for the account and uh yeah and it was one of those it's so it's it's danger will just like electricity I mean yeah I did one to two twenty a hot water tanks and things of that nature to him that that'll kill you so yeah I'm\nUp sort of seasonal but besides being ... um were electrocuted or ... or their potential hazards to to having the solar panels swept up in and we'll have a ton of ... hooked up to your house\nI don't see many if we do things well we kind of well good at screw things up so [laughter]\nYeah [laughter] but uh I don't I don't see anything anything if you leave it to the to the pros too to drive slower to the next stage on by the pros and the and the people that actually make an interest in each day that you ... they will manage the flow of power\nThan I think it's going to be very safe and hazards I I don't see I don't see many if you think about it in you know in a mall holds\nHolistic picture solar energy as being towering figure De Niro fall millions and millions of years you think of the trees of crops the weather I everything works with solar has been working forever\nSo we are we only tinkering of the the ... going to happen in the fall of ... of something that's already working the time for us what what I decided to get to my students is as then how many uh\nSomething that's already working big time for us what what I just I get to my students as then how many ah\nOh childish crew to carry your you know the big tankers when it takes to actually in light of the outside to get us the daylights that we take for granted um that they cannot be the number when they do the calculation if they are almost a trillion of them as\nWell so now I I went to a house a few years back in the house was actually set up where and moved in Arizona but it was a set up where it was being heated house was he didn't cooled through gee geothermal and and then the rest of the house was power or solar\nSee other so there's these abilities and I know you can't do really geothermal isn't something that's gonna work for us in the northeast um but in different parts of the country it it works great but that house was pretty much one hundred percent\nOff the grid they weren't taking they weren't using anything any other resources except the geothermal and\nAnd the the solar panel and I mean there's so many different areas in the country that can do that usually it's you're pretty much the bottom half of the United states\nShow yet though the western us if you have a single home you can get away with the perfect ... very well thought out or we think up and bring back to queens in the Bronx because the other ones which all sucking up vast amounts of energy and we have to solve that problem if you want to do something\nThat the thing that I was in the in the desert to sign and it's good to have you know sort of thing that if you don't solve the big cities problem and the big industries than away at well I'm going to go so that's what that's what some of my mind how to solve that equation out to be able to power in New York City Katie on the east coast evil\nRichard you mentioned France Belgium constructing a road that used um I'm a solar or technology or there are other countries that are ahead of the United states in this effort\nUh yes I think it by voting you in terms of inspiration er or\nGermany or cloudy country very cloudy not much more cloudy and upstate New York\nWas leading to well in terms of instilled sort of how many years in a China has taken over by leaps and bounds stake their way way ahead in ... comes out to us now yeah ten times more TV and growing or you\nAre they able to put it but they're not to the point where they're able to power small cities are they\nAre I I'm not sure that the intelligence of that program but they are building\n... of a photo takes on that putting it on the power grid so that's going to be a fraction of the law and all the ... the fraction of the power that goes on the electric green so they're not doing it seems at a time doing it\nThe whole country as as a whole\nAnd then another question is when it comes to manufacturing um these solar panels you mentioned the silicone as a major component um art supplies of silicon apple enough that we are going to actually be able to\nManufacture these panels inequality that we can ultimately as a world are using the\n... and ... say the second or third must step on the material on the planet or every rock is a third of all who said it gotten so when you take a piece of rock you're looking at ... ... there is city kind of is is there you just dig it up you have it\nAs a researcher and a developer uh\nThere is city kind of is there you just dig it up you have it\nSo as a researcher in a developer a and you've obviously had your hands involved in this for quite some time what do we expect for the next breakthroughs obviously we've talked about battery technology but um is it a matter of just these panels becoming more efficient or is there something else which should be looking forward to\nI think that technology is yeah the the next breakthrough he's ... for me we will be a kind of a let's have a plan on regulation type break to we're going going from the\nMancino photo that we have today white ... some customers in that field picture ... to the to the next step which she's making industrial power with solar energy ... northern Raj actually\nHaving the in the government implement laws to to push it\nYes change change the the way for instance you Remy narrates a kid or what our solar ... changed the way the regulations south are\nIn place today regulations in place today uh uh he uh to to do business as usual and interest in your production so if you come in with a new technologies which needs to work you know it's tough to get away doesn't seem quite right so that that kind of the problem hustler today that they sold\n... ... it's like around the tag on young you have squirrels how they're\nSo walking on the regular actually and um aspect to this is the ... called the future you\nKnow we have a lot of people listening who may be saying geez I really want to figure out what I can do to maybe rode utilize solar from my home or to help the national effort to support this technology what would you recommend to them\n[noise] but if you have a home and a nice roof you you could ask an installer tricky all us so one of the ... companies you mentioned sauce you need to to give you a quote and see if it makes sense for you if there is a new way for\nPeople who don't have the right rules saw with trees on the allowed and all that which is called the um [noise] come into the store I I like the model up eight seats by getting started in places like New York than other states where you actually become the owner of a\n... to ... to ... so you use your eyes to Salt Lake city somewhere you own it ... it ... goes on the great and they get to manage by the utility so that's a nice small for the future I'd say people\nAre getting from them getting old and and uh\nWhat what people the best thing people can do is is being conscious that so it can
