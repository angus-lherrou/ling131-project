um futuristic at this point\nI think though that if we have laws that allow people to state mining claims on asteroids say in return for surveying them to a certain degree of of detail or that we could get privately funding asteroid prospecting missions\nAre being launched a ... in in the very near future that is because\nOf mining claim even if you can't mine it today if if you think you're going to be able to mine at Thirty years from now or fifty years from now or it has some value and uh\nAnd and and the exchange for those claims and people could get a exploration missions finance mine the asteroids is something though for the future there are many asteroids that are extremely rich in rare earth metals in platinum group metals things like this that are extremely valuable\nAnd um once our space a capabilities advance a bit more ah that will become a possible thing to do\nLet's go to John in Seattle, Washington welcome to the program John go ahead\nYou for taking my call You're welcome thank you for your your gifts to Robert\nRobert Robert a great question the um oh probably take them off here [noise]\nRobert Roberta great questions of people who are um oh probably take them off here [noise] they're sort of speculative the first is um\nDo you know anything about ... years ago the ... ... ... anti gravity back in the sixties and ...\n... you know anything about possible reversal of being able to generate artificial gravity and secondly you know anything about electrical records proposals from the uh I mean that\nThose three questions we've got one more Robert ... one more okay one more\nYeah the third one is um we're gonna be ... to design a space station like a memorial type thing to test I'm a human physiology reacts to Mars gravity\nOr it Robert let's take that one first go ahead\nAll right well let me just a run 'em down quickly then maybe a provide some detail the first one Learjet and anti gravity I don't know anything about that\nSecond question artificial gravity um which goes along with your last question of a spinning spacecraft yeah we do know how to clean artificial gravity you spend the space craft\nCrates and typical force that mimics gravity and that's a uh in my view a a a a very wise thing to do on a long space voyage in order to ah prevent the deterioration of bone and muscle that you can't with um\nZero gravity along belongs to a long time so\nYeah exactly 'cause if you you know anybody who just walks around on earth you know ... not an athlete just a person that you know walks around the house goes to the store they they get somewhat of a workout 'cause they're carrying a hundred and fifty pounds on their feet and and and and and and you know and moving it around a\nA worse in space just floating around in zero gravity you don't get that\nAnd so in fact I Do recommend artificial gravity for use on trips\nTomorrow so not that we couldn't survive going there and zero gravity we can but if you're going to Mars to explore you don't want your astronauts arriving there in a weakened condition no roller mobile do any reporter\nRight and then the the the third question was electrical pulse and yeah I Know a fair amount about electrical pulse ...\nUm electric propulsion is using a electric or electromagnetic forces to\nAccelerate at ... pounds to very high velocity she can get about ten times the exhaust philosophy with an electric roster that you can with chemicals roster the problem though is that it requires electricity to run them and typically the power sources way a lot\nAnd that means that I'm\nYour power is limited and therefore you're thrust is limited and what that means is that electrical pulse and systems\nAre kind of like a car that gets a thousand miles to the gallon and but it goes from zero to sixty in a week I'm not terribly useful for short distance driving around town\nBut if you were going to drive around the world and let's say there was somehow a road that went all the way around the world okay you floor of the car you know in San Francisco and um\nYou know a week later going sixty miles an hour and you've reached a the east coast and now you can go driving around the world 'cause your car can drive over water and\nIt's an hour and you've reached the east coast and now you can go driving around the world because your car can drive over water in this case but in any case now you you have a tremendous advantage in that your your your mileage is great\nBut if you're going from earth to Mars and actually takes longer to get there with electric propulsion than it does with chemical bullshit\nIf because it the time it takes to speed up is longer than the time it takes to get there\nOn the other hand if you going from earth to Saturn electric propulsion would get you there faster\nRobert if you had to pick one man going back to the moon or going to Mars which would you pick\nI pick Mars you would uh be costs you know I mean look we went to the moon fifty years ago or we're not going to inspire the next generation by doing things that their grandparents' generation did\nUh the science on Mars is far more profound we're going to discover the truth about the potential uh existence and diversity of life in the universe and Mars has got much more resources to compare Mars to the moon\nTo the choice in the age of ocean exploration Mars compares to the moon to way North America compared to greet you know Greenland was closer to Europe European scotch Greene long before they got to North America [noise] but it wasn't a place where you could build a civilization that didn't have all the different resources\nAnd ah so Mars is is is you know it's\nA much richer world but you know here's NASA and frankly doesn't have the confidence to take on Mars well then they say well then we'll go to the moon well when I see is okay if you think you need to go to the moon before you go to Mars then get on with the go to the moon don't come off with\nSome other thing that the halfway house you have to do before you go to the moon because if we can go to the moon fifty years ago we could go to the moon now\nCan you believe ... next July will be fifty years since we went to the moon would the first time fifty years already run the word the time go\nYeah I don't know I was Seventeen when we landed on the moon and if anybody told me then that I'd be sixty six and we'd be sitting here stuck on earth I I I Would have thought they were crazy\nYeah I Would agree east of the Rockies Joe's with us Long Island New York Hey Joe go ahead law\nBut I'm Sorry they can get to go to the mall but a couple of questions are in deep space uh when we send out these probes\nA woods you are\nOr what would you be dealing with extreme heat even open space as opposed to the top planets\nAnd would it be advantageous to us to kind of go to mercury or what some sort of probes in case back here we have run away a global warming due to maybe solar flares combined with C. O. two increases\nAre in other words what the spin off of dealing with extreme heat and space help us to deal with the potentially back here and also what kind of person would profile ah going to Mars\nUh how would you profile a potential candidate to travel on a ship them to Mars\nWhat type of personality looking for\nAll right let me take the questions one at a time of the first question it'd be hot and space if you're close to the sun um if you're a far away from the sun it's called uh and uh if you're in earth orbit\nUm if you are far away from the sun it's called ... and ah if you're in earth orbit time it depends on whether you're in the sun right now or not\n[noise] um but um [noise]\nYou know we do have a kind of I mean you can't you can ... the reason why spacesuits white is because they they can overheat from sunlight and they want to reflect most\nAs much as you can write a\nOn the other hand things that are in shadow even in earth orbit can get cold so you kinda have to watch that\nUh but space itself doesn't really have a temperature but certainly the power of the sun is much more when you're close to it get hotter much faster I'm now second question\nProfiles of people well okay\nHold on for a second there Robert we're going to hit the brake already school by fast with you Robert ... with us we'll be back will let them finish up ... questions there and uh they're interesting what kind of a personality would want to go to Mars will be back in the moment I'm coast to coast am\nYou used to go hours without visiting the bathroom now it seems like you're constantly getting up to the end you're even getting up at night to go this is not okay listen\nThe makers of super beta prostate the number one prostate formula are introducing a new one pill super ... prostate piece three advanced with three key ingredients that are great for your prostate it's like taking three prostate supplements and one\nTo celebrate we're sending free bottles to men who want to cut down on bathroom trips yes your first thirty days supply is free\nPay shipping and handling just dial hounded two fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle\nEarly research suggests that an ingredient in ... three advanced may help support an normal prostate size combine that\nWith a production ... urges the pie and you have a formula you'd be crazy not to try try pizzeria draft free dial pound to fifty on your mobile phone and say the key word free bottle again dial pound to five zero and see the key word free bottle\n[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWelcome back to coast to coast our final segment with Robert Zubrin here from the Martian Saudi Robert ... by the way are linked up it goes to goes to end up dump Robert you you have looked at profiles of people and personalities who would love to go to Mars what did they like\nWell I'm well there's all sorts of people that say they want to go to Mars uh [noise]\nUm I mean quite literally and and some are people that are you might well want on a crew a it's going to Mars and others not a chance that the caller asked what sort of people would I select to go to Mars\nUm and I'll tell you it's real simple it's the same sort of people that you would select to go on a say a a hiking expedition with you\nI'm a or an exploration uh adventure of any kind um they're the people who you know\nHave a high spirits are fun to be with a guy in the sense of humor a ... you know or not you know a grouchy um and and and ... and and and you know and and the people who can laugh when things go wrong and people who you know are are one for all in all for one\nThat's all you want to take tomorrow what's going on with the August conference you're working on\nA well we're having another conference or in August uh or actually this year it might be in September in Los Angeles I'm ... could a ... it's probably going to be at one of the major universities in Los Angeles\nUm and ah\nI'm sure we're going to have all sorts of debates about things like is this lunar orbit gateway or is it a gateway or is it a toll booth\nOkay you know we're going to have that one out um you know we're going to have all sorts of presentations on the latest discoveries you know it there's a marsh probe on its way it's going to land in November of insight and it's ...\nOn the latest discoveries you know ... there's a marsh probe on its way it's going to land in November call insight and it's going to find out how geologically active Mars is so that's kind of land this November and we'll probably have\nUm a discoveries from ... um\nThere's also a new space telescope that just got into orbit um a couple of months ago which will be reporting data discovering planets going around other stars or am I guess it will have discovered hundreds by them and you will prompt discover thousands\nWere done I'm ... I'm you know a will\nYou know since we're going to be in Los Angeles will have a scientist from Jet Propulsion lab coming over and\nTalking about a um all the latest discoveries from the rovers on Mars and the plans for the next one's a problem we have ... people talking about what they're up to I'm hoping to get flu arch and people there too so we can hear from them\nAnd maybe some from the the the small entrepreneur rocket companies like vector space just got funded by Seventy million dollars to be small launches you know the we now have small satellites that can do what it used to take big satellites\nTo do and so small rockets make a lot of sense\nI'm and I'm a\nI'm myself from involved design of mission to go to the moon ground penetrating radar with for satellites each of which are the size of ...\nUm and so little watchers like this could really play a role um\nAren't sinking to more calls for you in school the first time caller Armand in a bell gardens California go ahead Armand\nYes good evening George did you and your guest I just wanted to put something on your radar screen so to speak\nAnd that is that you may not be aware of this but there's a whole new paradigm for water planetary water on NATO ally earth but on march\nIf you're interested in learning more about it you can go to geo water I. N. G.
