so many one picture dreams\nFor ever feel like you need a story with a beginning a middle and an end because especially tonight [laughter] we've talked about so many one picture dreams you don't need a big long story to get it\nTo to me like I'm Sorry I'm Sorry no sir I was going to have to go to John in New York John got a question John welcome to the program I don't got\nNo not that I had a dream about a month and a half ago it was like a dream that I haven't had and thirty probably\nFive six years now in the dream it was a little bit different this time around as when we were packing up and leaving it would be like um when I was little touches wouldn't be their family be there'd be a cottage on a lake\nUm lots of snow Globes not necessarily Christmas clubs but a lot of like antique things and\nAnd there was a an outdoor patio that had life size Disney characters on it\nThat we used to wrestle with in the dream and then\nThe new dream I had we were like had one day to get out of there and pack up and go and we couldn't get everything X amount of things got left behind certain snow Globes and\nActually all the Disney characters\n\nSo I don't know what that means\nThat you that you had a long time ago and it just come back they\nCame back me thirty five thirty six years later yes I used to have it on a lot they used to be like a peaceful Sunni dream was like a happy during\nHis within and leaving us they're excellent John and so typically it's something if you're having a difficult time about something in your life we're having a difficult climate that something do you think about a month ago [noise]\nBecause there's a wonderful dream you give yourself a dream from childhood that makes you feel soon [laughter] could kind of like they're inside to something that's stressing you and your life for the wonderful [noise]\nUm image to choose\nYou know certain things got left behind I wasn't sure if that was the\nTrigger point or whatever but I like a trigger point too I agree with you because that makes me want to ask you what are you seeing what's happening in your life about a month ago where you just don't have all the pieces that you need some things getting left behind and honestly I don't\nThink anything I mean well basically you want a gas well three years ago I've been sober for drugs I got addicted to pain medicine but that's\nLong in over with um everything's been good family wise is great kids are great everything's good\nRight well I you know of course I Can't tell you what was going on in your life about a month ago but I Do know that it looks like you're choosing some kind of all a memory\nAnd say that it makes you see you say it makes me feel good except it's interesting that you say you only had one day to get out yeah that was that we are as far as we had to leave\nThings behind it seems\nRight and I so then that's where I Would go I Would ask you what do you think that you're leaving behind and will there ever leaving it isn't really the drugs you said that you were a drug addict inside it\nYeah you yeah I've been clean for a little over three years now\n[noise] okay well that's good so\nI've been clean for a little over three years now\nAmazing okay well that's good so that's something that you left behind but it's just there's this thing about one day to get out that's where I'd focus on it was me I'd be looking at the [noise] what kind of some kind of\nPressure that may have been on a boat a month or six weeks ago you said because\nThere are wish this shortage and I was six weeks you ought to be gold [noise] um\nYeah I own a business in New York it's kind of a pain in the neck here and there but\nYou know that's the key right not tell you what anybody who owns the New York has dreams they can't

me well yes\nI'm thank you um do actually I've had I'm not to sound morbid but I've had um\nQuote unquote that dream since I was eleven years old I'm the first one started even before I saw the movie the shining\nWhere I was in Paris bathrooms and Jack Nicholson and\nNot knock down more with a nap and kill me and I actually in the dream floated above my dead body in my dead body\nLaying on my parents' bathroom floor but anyway after that once I started to get a little bit older I Would have these recurring dreams of\nBeing in a car accident and it was a ... driver every single time\nAnd we\nWill they did or did they do know the people who drive the car or if it's somebody you know\nUh yeah it was everything a person there was somebody that I knew I was in ... New Jersey and I I Know it sounds like trust issues and everything I use my puppy he's looking in the background but um\nEvery time that I Would be a different it would be a different ... and I'd be in the passenger seat and this would be a recurring dream\nRight and I would have a dream like that that real curves one different situations happen in my life\nWhere I Am not feeling like I'm driving the bus [laughter] I'm feeling like I don't have control over what's happening and it feels like I often give over control to others and not to myself\nAnd so dreams like ... or ah the cold them is favored expression what you have a dream that a ... over a period of years it's the exact same thing as a favorite expression", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "10"}
