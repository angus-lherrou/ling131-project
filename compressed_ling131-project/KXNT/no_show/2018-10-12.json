poets and artists and scientists and uh\nI I'm Down through the ages\nOr let's go to Steve in Pennsylvania is a question hasty welcome to the show\nI how you're doing good ...\nI was just wondering if the guest says any picture any documentation any video\nOf life on other planets\nOh yes I Do I and my all my Venus book um there there are all fully illustrated a hundred photos and H A n and I'm I'm In each book and um well recently I just came back from the um\nAre from Venus with love world conference in um\nUh up in Mount Shasta was up there with a neck on act the ambassador a from a nurse and I shared many uh original never before seen documents from some of the contact the so the Nineteen fifties Sam\nAnd early Nineteen sixties or specifically I'm Dominic with Cathy and I'm and Truman bathroom um and I just recently published an article\nA that was on a lawn strict colors um phantom said monsters dot com about the new ... base or a clarity on on the far side of the moon\nAnd uh and the moon as of nutrition colony on the far side of the moon so I'm a yes or a two to your question\nSo but thank you very you know there's only one of your welcome machines do so\nLet me ask you this though and I mean anybody can say their views and where's the proof is how do we know that what they're saying is accurate\nOkay ah well ah well one of the the new ... that um that I've had some experience with um [noise] uh I have pictures of her um ah with me at different\nPoints in my life as well as some pictures I'm from um\nUh before I was born and she hasn't changed in her appearance and they're actually you can actually see them in my eye in the book um ah it all the Venus both said you know different stages\nOkay so in other words they age a lot slower than us\nUm yes yes uh uh anywhere they can go anywhere from a five hundred to two thousand years or more\nWell in in if they were lasting that long in of course reproducing and so you think that eventually there\nOkay well in in if they were lasting that long and of course reproducing and so you'd think that eventually there'd be more of a new version on this planet than there would be an actual earthlings humankind correct\nUh oh well there you know their their hair and about um\nI Would say about four to five thousand at any uh in any given\nTime oh so there's only four four to five thousand\n... is that the the uh the mistake rural me I'm back in the thirteenth century uh he had a lot to say about the new show and send an angel as Billy Graham\nA ball and yeah I Know ... said that angels and aliens or were one of his name is exactly well\nRoom and he said that um that there's a about four thousand of them on the earth that any at any one time so they they live in certain\nThat um she was um [noise] uh that that we were standing with or that we were by located I'm On the planet I'm a called bail at time in the serious star sector as well as my time as well as Mount Shasta\nAnd I'm a ... she said she was there to answer she knew why we were there and she was going to answer our questions about flying saucers and um she a I'm told us all up out of a nutrition colony and the serious star sector\nAnd um she said if we looked up the side of the mountain we could see the Samantha beings\nAre that were from five to Fifteen feet and we ... we saw him\nAnd um yeah and then she said that the inhabitants of bail at time the women it's a a matriarchal societies because the women can communicate with the man to to control the Stargate and open a\nYou know open and close the Stargate\nAnd um um\nShe said that they all the time was about three times the size of the earth and it was mostly mountain dislike the region we were at in Mount Shasta, California\nAnd um um we we were blown away in case that strip which are in our group and she um uh we held meetings at her house or or Clayton Parker's house and\nUm but she asked if she could take a picture of lady and car and I'm a widow grew\nAnd so lady and cars stood in the middle\nAnd she took this picture and when we got back to Salt Lake city to Murray, Utah the suburb or two of one hour photo Matt uh the picture came back but um uh we were all in it but we're waiting car or what's in it it was like a\nUm it\nLike maybe she's a lighter density or something and a white just went right through our\nUm it was um it was really amazing we were all blown away and then and then plate and said you know who that was\nAnd we said no no I'm a who was that and he said it was an ally scare and who is his friend she was born\nI'm In uh Eighteen nine uh Eighteen Ninety eight I'm the seventh day to seven tower and the seven months\nAnd um uh she she had written nine books about I'm esoteric subject before she she uh physically translated and was taken up to Venus\nI'm looking around at times when I'm really I Do want to go back to the discussion about missions being honors or do we have an easier\nI no no I'm a you know the um uh if uh if we had something to fear from um ah\nFrom the ... I'm a ... you know\nUm if we had something to fear from um uh from the ... um\nI ... you know we don't really have anything to fear because if something always going to be down it would have been down a long time ago and I'm a dairy they're here to um to watch it and guide us in our development\nAs you know it's a Russian scientists Carthage as it came up with it a scale of galactic civilizations that um when the civilization can make it to its type wine or they have a unified political system\nAnd um they have a uh they've attained a level of peace and they can use utilize energy at a planetary level but we haven't even arrived at that stage yet and\nI'm a ... of a nuisance are doing all they can behind the scenes to to to help us um um get help I survive\nBecause there are many civilizations out there that that never that never quite made it\nSo then all the reports that we've heard of Venus and ah it's not the claim that it's eight hundred plus degrees Fahrenheit I'm just ... and all these other things you don't believe any of that that's come from NASA's accurate\nAnd no I I I don't believe that it's accurate\nWell and I know Venus has always been considered ... sister planet um why why do you think they do give us information is saying all these negative things about Venus if it was in habitable for for humankind\nAh well I'm you know they\n... they would have a vested interest in protecting the establish order on\nA here here on earth because I'm a our socio economic systems would a would disappear and our civilization would crumble the powers that be yeah a with down a loose their grip oh over us\nNew well why do you think that would happen just by having a planet that would be inhabitable I mean is is humankind were pretty much destroying the planet so I think you would only benefit us to know that well first of all we we need to stop the strings planet but secondly\nAh there was another in habitable planet oh\nOh yeah so the the new ... the um um you know they are they are a beacon of hope how out there but um\nYou know they they can't interfere in um they can't interfere directly in the in the progress of human history in the course of human history\nOkay and and I get that I I don't under fully understand it I mean if you're such an advance culture or civilization you think that you'd want to uh be involved in in ... instead of trying to manipulate things behind the scenes you'd want to be involved in the forefront trying to guide\nThe population of that plan of civilization of that planet to the next level but why would NASA or the government have a vested interest in keeping it private that there's other planets out there that we could resigned on\nOh um well\nI I think that it just that the fact that it would reveal that they're ...\n\nWell I I I think that it just that the fact that it would reveal that their presence there and uh and uh\nWhat was he was that I I think that would\nBe if they get game changer I don't think it's so much that the um ... you know whether we believe in a ... or not but whether we believe and I'm I'm In ourselves\nWell yeah I just I'm I guess I Am confused on why that would be a bad thing no I mean we we've got\nThe satellites out there we got these probes out there looking for the possibility of other in habitable planets or other life out there why not admit to oh my God we found even if even if you don't say we've known known about it for fifty sixty Seventy years just say\nWe found another we ... we saw on life we found intelligent life\nUm yeah I guess it's the um it's the whole thing about disclosure and it's only going to come about tap on an individual basis for the for for the time being if people have experiences [noise]\nUh with uh with extraterrestrials and more and more people see their space craft 'em in there in our atmosphere than ah [noise] ah when enough people demand the truth take to come out as well\nYou know but yeah but I also foresee that instead of the spacecraft in our atmosphere will bring a presence of fear of dominance of oh my God the technology that's far beyond us but to actually have people that are already here on this planet come out and say hey we're\nFrom Venus were and this is this is our proof to show that and we're we're here to help you and we've been here for this long I think that's sort of it might be an eerie factor but it sort of takes away the fear factor of them hovering over some spacecraft\nBut what would they would they want to do that or would they want to be in the position of having to be over lord said the planet\nWell I I mean if you're working in the ... yellow on\nOur own initiative and our own accord so that we could take our rightful place and the galactic federation\nBut are we are we actually island that on our own though I mean if they're working behind the scenes are we actually doing that on our own because they're working behind the scenes in and getting us to that point\nSo we're not we're not actually doing it on our own in the first was\nA well they're they're they're giving us and not getting the right direction\nOkay\nBut that they're not actually taking a a you know taking taking our hand and forcing us there", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "12"}
