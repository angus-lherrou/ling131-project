D printers are they basically just plastic layers is that what they do they just basically well just lay a material ... layers and what ...\nWhat they have actually different types the amusement of filling out some use a certain types of PVC now they actually have some that that you can use metal and some use some type of chemicals to print so that your body part\nYes so what does that's got to be organic than real energy noticed or they're getting some even food now like I only will yeah well yeah I Know I Will reason I bring it up is there's a story that\n... they are now selling parental parental three portable home home politically for four thousand bucks they think this is actually going\nYou can end homelessness and concrete set up to yeah kind of it does look concrete light but I'm sure the plastic it's got to be plastic right but they each they show these tent cities in these in you know a lot of impoverished nations that and I think actually ... ah San Francisco has a tent city somewhere\nI'm probably other universities do women Seattle yeah um but uh they imprint these homes for four grand and they're not particularly large but there are ... they don't look too bad because you might ... nice little place to live actually you know not really any but somebody and they'd be\nDoing a lot of those street printing homes and it is some sort of a like a stuck on material it's not plastic that's being used on that but it's good because they say that it it's great against the elements that a hole in the temperature it's cooler during the during the summer and\n... neck of the woods and through that we meet a lot of people but then um we also get we get phone calls\nI'm all the time we we become very popular in October as as I'm sure you are and many people in our field are or where the phone is ringing off the hook in April but\nI'm like the over and we're we seem to be very busy in fact tonight we had a a very interesting for us in the ... or ah this this one was this one was fun we get we get a lot\nFrom doing our presentations in her book talk and for anybody in the paranormal who thinks he can make a lot of money off the books\nWe make most of our money I'm from our public speaking gigs we don't make very much money off our books but uh the books turn into opportunities to speak and through that is where we usually make the bulk of our money\nBecause we are trying to make money doing this is as much as we love it and it is a passion we are trying to uh at least offset some of the cost involved in in doing the work that we do\nSo we got a phone call a few months ago from a ... somebody who is who is recommended by one of our libraries and um they said oh I heard you guys are fantastic and we'd love to have you come in and who are banned and it was a senior group and\nI was like oh that that sounds great and she's like oh you come so highly recommended can't wait so we set up the gig and we're all confirmed caffeine I showed up there tonight\nAnd his way on the end and about an hour away from where from where I live which is almost another half an hour from were Cathy what's\nSo we show up to the event and it's the senior center at the seniors group and the first thing they asked us we notice everyone was in costume was you need a place to change and\nWe're like oh no we we we we were okay and I don't you have to put on your your costumes\nWe thought well maybe it's a costume party and like well we don't really have a\nCostume we we put our aprons army have haunted housewives embroidered aprons everywhere and they're really cute and it's a nice visual and when we do our presentations but she's like well what what do you need for your performance they thought we were doing some sort of of a a singing and\nDancing or we're live action player we're not sure exactly what they expect that we were like it's a PowerPoint presentation we just need a screen in a project or\nRemind complete remind leave that Young Frankenstein monster ducks song came but we do\nIs like we can all we are going to pull it off I mean we were her Italy which bringing the corner going what are we going to do what should we but we did we did explain to them this is a story telling you know we talked about her book and I said the lady\nWe're going to tell some stories and you know it's going to end and it goes story that's good for Halloween and she's like oh okay and she seemed like relieved\nSo we went through our whole thing we didn't ended up we did not get any type of power point information or you know there was no protector there was no screen these ladies have no idea what was going on so there were about fifty of 'em and we just went up and did our best and told our stories\nAnd they didn't fall asleep so we were like this good you know they're doing well\nAre shaking their heads like they're listening and at the very end uh we got ready to say goodnight\nUh started packing up our things because you know the ladies were ready to move ahead to the brownies\nAnd snack time one lady gets up to offer the prayer before they start their meeting and starts to proselytize on the dangers and the a devil being involved in the paranormal and how what we do we must you know\nCover ourselves in prayer and she just kept going and going and it got worse and worse and I said we better hurry and get outta here they're going to burn off at the state\nSo quickly packed up and like ... and ran out of there has been going on and on about\nThe demons involved in paranormal and how we shouldn't be so glib about what we're talking about and oh my gosh it just ended really badly\nAnd in the building to get something we had forgotten I was we like had a plan like if she didn't show up how long should go in and get rescuer and should I call the police you know because I didn't think this was going to go wow [laughter]\nSo we'd go to a few minutes here before we have to do to break 'em I Want to get a sense of when you decided to write this book how did you start to research the stories that ended up being included in the book\nWill of the some of the stories are are there well known ghost stories they're they're a historic people so these are real people and real events and um we were fascinated by the history because we we come from up a place of history that's kind of our\nOur our nature we really like the historic\nAt aspects of the paranormal and the stories that we tell\nSome of these stories just came up when we were looking for things to do presentations on and we found these incredible stories\nAnd uh we we we kept writing into a lot of them had this common theme of what they were a love story not necessarily a happy romantic\nFlowers and candy love story but they the the central themes besides the haunting seem to be love so after reading into a few of these when we were looking for things to talk about\nWe decided well maybe we can put a bunch of these together like Cathy said some of these are ... are in the love and in a in a very bad way so they become almost a a a true crime story that happens they have a haunting attached to it but the crime is driven by my passion or obsession\nSo ah we just found that these stories stuck still uh they they stood out to us and then we ... it became a\nJust the job of narrowing down that the best ones that we wanted to put in the book where we could represent all the different aspects of love in its various forms\nAnd um and people that might be familiar to where readers so not all the stories will be familiar but many of them people will know who we're talking about or be familiar with the story itself\nAre there any pushed moods you do you have either huge huge issue so\nOh yeah we ... with a personal experiences\nWe we intervene those because like I Can't these first book is a lot of her personal experiences my book was a lot of our adventures together or places that we had been in places we investigated but with for this book since a lot of the stories are very uh famous\nStories famous haunting famous love stories but we have an entire chapter in the book that\nDeals with animals and pets and pet spirits and\nAnd uh the the devotion that our pet showed us and how that love that bond of love is not broken because they animal stories seem to be the most popular people seem to really enjoy that I've written for online magazines before in my most popular stories that generated the most traffic were the ones about animals\nSo we have stories in there with all that we know in our own personal experiences with animal spirits and that type of love\nYou and your marriage animal onto ... or so\nI mean everybody loves them and especially when you lose an animal life I've had my own experiences here when I lost my my dog was Thirteen year old black top German Shepherd and bill and Jimmy and I've talked about it after we lost him lying on the bed going even\nTold them get up on the bed like you did every night\nDelayed between life and I and ... and that's such a such a great feeling a little you know it's one of those one journal when you when you really when you have them\nThe popular and and it's something that everybody can relate to so we're very that that chapter that we probably could have done a whole book just on that and that is something to consider for our next book but\nI'm In even tonight at the grand daughter was with us at the presentation and she wanted that we wanted to end up being happy no because we thought we were going to get\nBurned at stake at this present days and so we we actually cut out our best story like the scariest story in the book we cut that out of the presentation and we added the animal stories and and I kept his daughter came and she gave her a little personal story about\nHer uh her pet cat that passed away so I think everybody can relate and even if you maybe don't believe in goes you can relate to that on that you\nHave with your animals and your pets especially you know of family cat or a dog\n... and because of the pets are and they're pretty much just like ... and what are your children they really are and it's just it's amazing because you don't realize how important they are in till till you lose them\nAnd that's one of those bonds that I think easily continues on the grave\nBecause they were so much a part of your daily life but not like a person where we are talking to them but they were just there always and I think because you have you meet with them on a different spiritual level than you do with human beings I just think that that's such a strong bond that it's\nEasy to imagine them still walking down your hall or laying on your bed or different things that would occur when people say I know that my animals still here with me\nYeah well we're talking with a hundred housewives ... or ... the weather and we're discussing their new book love beyond the grave true tails of haunted heart and we're going to take a break and we're going to really we're going to get into a lot more of these stories on the book\nOur Carl chancellor and people may remember this story um if they if they've ever watched some of those history shows on TV uh Karl von costs all was a German born Dr reclaimed to be a doctor who moved from Germany\nTo Key West and when he was in Key West in the Nineteen thirties he got a job working at one of the hospital's down there and at this time tuberculosis was ravaging the nation actually all over the world ... this was really widespread and a\nHard line castle who was an interesting character to just say the least and he he he wasn't a doctor I don't think he was really doctor but he claimed to have this medical background he was working there and\nThere he encountered a young woman named Maria oils and he believed that she was the woman he was destined to be with his his true love\nAnd he had seen visions of her\nSince she was a young man in Germany and then she walks into his\nHospital and he's in his sixties at this point and she's Twenty one twenty two years old and he basically became her private physician and promised in her family that he could rescue her and safer from tuberculosis which he could not\nUm and unfortunately the story ends with a or doesn't and the story goes on to have poor Maria di but he\nManaged to a\nSet up for her a burial it to me she was in a mausoleum that he had built for\nAnd he used to go visit her in this Muslim for years until one day he decided that her spirit was calling to him from the afterlife for two to married to be married they she wanted them to be married and live together as husband and wife so he took her body\nFrom the ... it took it back to his home and he did his best to preserve it and he filled her cavities with with with a cloth and paper and a wax on her skin or replaced her eyes with marbles and and put\nA wigs and in in lotions\nOver her to try to preserve her physical body and he lived with her in his home as man and wife in in every way that a man and wife are together for seven years before it was discovered\nThen it became this national sensation when\nIt was discovered that he had stolen this body from the grave and it was a performing acts of ... on it and living with this corps and this poor woman who died of tuberculosis was stolen from her grave\nUh was raped after death in this home in Key West and then after it was discovered he was arrested and she was put on display again\nAnd it it was just absolutely horrible and the story of curled handler is very very popular story enough if you've ever visited\nHear about it 'cause it's like the the worst thing that ever happened there but it was an international sensation and he was such an interesting character I mean I only touched on his his weirdness and his\nEccentricities and that story is is probably my favorite because it it's so macabre and so many levels and then of course it ends with the haunting um but that one is definitely my favorite in the book\nThe story broke us believe her sister the one heard rumors going on when they finally found the tuition but he was charged with drug free\nAnd he was he was arrested but he was never charged the only thing they could really charged him with was um abusive a corpse and it had been seven years so the statute of limitations on their crime and run out so yeah he was a\nHe was disgraced and he he he didn't understand he thought he did nothing wrong because in his mind and his warped mine he truly believe that she initiated this\nThis love affair that she she was calling to him from beyond the grave please rescue me I'm I'm cold and dark gets lonely here please take me home I Want to be married to you he was a nut job but the story itself was crazy and it was you're right it was the sister that\nThat heard the rumors and say what happened he was to go visit this grave every day and then he stopped\nWhat's going on and she's the one who found the grave empty I was very very disturbing I mean I just my heart just breaks for for the oil is family and poor Maria I mean there's so many different aspects that story she was married when she first contract it to ... and her husband's like\nYeah I'm not sick it around for this he wasn't the for better or worse type apparently so she just had it rough I feel so bad for her and then to to just be\nStill a disgrace like that and to be to be put on display like like some sort of a an oddity I mean that that makes it even worse there's pictures if you look it up if you look the story up you can see pictures of people\nPiling hundreds of people piling past her her ... her corps when she's laid out after her discovery is is really really sad\nYou know interviewing the name of coral yeah calls handler\nWas his real name but he he thought he was related to count in a hospital who was this woman who is to be married to the king of Poland and she became exiled and lived in this castle near his home and he thought he was related to her I could not find any\nAny proof that he actually was any relation to her but um it his mind he was a she was her she was his spirit guide according\nTo the mind that person is going to come home yeah much more than shores\nWell my favorite story is it started as a ... like strange history so it kind of calls to us and this was the legend of many ... and I don't know if you're familiar with it\nBut as I did my research I found many clay was very much a real person her family were real and they did live in Michigan\nAnd the story went on that um many at a young age moved to Michigan near port Santa lack which is the biggest town nearby but they were actually living in forester and forest or was a shipping town in the Eighteen hundreds they shipped can you imagine lumber\nSo um they built this huge stock in the Eighteen forties like a a feat of engineering at that\nNine hundred feet out into Lake Huron and they were welcoming the ships to forester to pick up their lumbering to go about their way I mean at that time it would have been scooters and freighters\nBut um as time went on many had a little bit of wander lost in her heart as a fourteen year old girl and of course she was drawn down to the docks where all the activity and the excitement was\nAnd she visited the docks almost daily when the weather permitted met a sailor\nAnd then the town got involved because they noticed she met a sailor and we're got back to her parents who were very disapproving locked or in a room so she could not meet her young sailor that she loved\nAnd when winter came all she could do is see his ship out there in November leaving the port knowing that he didn't know what had happened to her and she could not say goodbye when um when the spring time came she rushed to the docks trying to find news of her sailor\nAnd no one had any information until finally one day a gruff merchant man walked up to me and said I Know where he is he's at the bottom of Lake Huron during the November Gales his ship went down and everyone on board did parish including your love\nWell many just a young girl was distraught walked home to her house she got on her best\nGown and walked through the town\nA passing by people waving for Laura Lee and walk to the end of the dock\nAnd jumped into Lake Huron and this was April so ... around the great lakes we know the lake is not appropriate for swimming in April was probably between thirty and forty degrees and she drowned almost instantly uh the newspaper article said they grappled for her body for for over an hour or so that's a sad story in itself\nAnd when they pulled me out of the water the a corner listed her as death by suicide\nI'm being so upset about losing her her one true love at fourteen\nThat she killed herself and the the legend goes on and the stories continue that\nThis town a forester is still haunted by many ... who wanders along the lake I found quite a few uh as I did my research I found quite a few people saying they had encountered that goes to ... to even to this day\nUm there's like some old buildings there and in the eighties there was such a a an interest in many clay\nThat uh some of the people tried to capitalize on the ghost\nBy um like one man owned a steak house and he started advertising he had the best steaks in town and that goes to many Quaid did my hunch is steakhouse so they started sending tour buses to this man's steak house so that people could get a steak and meet the goes to many clay and he was found to be you know\nKind of a little strange and he he actually was brought up on charges of fraud because he didn't have the best steak [laughter] and he didn't have the goes to equate either so", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "04"}
