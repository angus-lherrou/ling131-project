the website I'm miserable but we've got a short segment here I'd like to grab another phone call before we go to a break and this is Jim in New York Jim welcome to the show\nHey Jason shady Mr low happy all Hallows from western younger hello we knew and thanks woman who's you\nYeah I just wanted to make a comment or there was a movie it was made a few well quite a few years back over Thirty years I'm you're familiar with re animator I take it right or no course\nWell the thing about it is is I always wondered why the movie that came out after work from beyond you don't even hear about it and then I always thought it was just a much better made movie and much more interesting and it was horror psi phi like we were talking about earlier\nUm are you were talking about earlier I just it's based on an HP love crab short story and you just don't hear much about it and I was just wondering if you want to comment on it it had Jeffrey oh yeah\nI mean I I think it's I think it is well made I think that it was more uh it's it's success was more on home video I don't think it got good distribution\nUm you know the early eighties was kind of a wild west and by the time we got to the leader eighties horror movies ah especially really extreme ones were starting to get kind of pooh poohed on a little bit I'm so toward the very end of the eighties and I'm not exactly sure when from beyond came out um\nI don't know if that was the leader eighties or or the nineties even\nUm but I did my down time what was it Nineteen eighty six eighty six\nSo by the later eighties you know I mean again that's why you had so many movies the leader eighties whether it was like children as a central character to sort of avoid the kind of sex and they were to have a reason for toning it down like movies like a monster squad return of living get her to win\nYou know I'm a ... there's a lot a lot of um ... they were they were kind of real in it in\nA so I think a lot of extreme horror movies have a harder time and distribution rather than on home video so I think that it's not a matter of just what that it was bad I just think that it didn't it didn't it didn't perform well perhaps in theaters or was it or didn't get good distribution\nAnd um you know or maybe something really spectacular opened that same weekend and just rounded out but um [noise] you know that those kind of things happen and uh usually it doesn't have much to do with the quality of the film it's just the fact that it's the tree falling in the forests nobody nobody heard it\nRight right I liked the idea what the resonate her and the poor hole and all the whole nine yards with you know the stuff floating around in the air and it just seemed that just seems so much more\nIntriguing to me than just three animator movie itself just seem kind of weak where it was just some you know some guy walking around with you know some kind of renovating fluid and bringing body back to I mean it was great but it didn't have it was\nCertainly revolutionary Ford's time you know what I mean they were trying to make a PBS mini series out of that believe it early and ah of and they expanded into a movie\n[noise] wow well I Do appreciate it that's all I\nOf that believe it or and or of and they expanded into moving\n[noise] wow well I Do appreciate it that's all I had to say I just wanted to bring that movie up I thought it was a you know it's just an overload on\nYour on forgotten them it's all under appreciated overlooked and that's those are those are two of my favorite category\nAnd it's I'm I'm gonna thanks Jim for that tip and the phone call I'm going have to look that went up because I Can't even remember that we've got about a minute before we have to go to break Mr logo in that minute I Want to talk about a plan nine of film it in some ways was billed as a remake of play nine from outer space you played the role of course well in ...\nUm I don't really think it was a remake but I really enjoyed the film\nOh well thank you I I think it's more of a furthering perhaps a love letter word or B movies in general\nUh you know it was interesting because when I first were when I first got the part I thought oh this'll be easy under the narrator there when I read the script that like jumping on top of cars and killing them\nBut it was really a burden me or are you know I'm always just a host and at this time I really got to be a kind of an action hero so I I really enjoyed\nI don't know he had he had something like that it was a horrible here next to me a while back that he was doing some ghost ... a TV show with with science by as well and I never saw\nThat this was years ago though and it was actually feature on ... which was an offshoot of mystery science theater let's go let's take another quick call here this is a stand in Pennsylvania's been waiting on hold for a while he's staying welcome to show\nThat except for the first time caller welcome and I I really love your show\nOh well they are much uh it's something that\nI did all that joy ... for questions here haven't talked about the B. movies of all I may be a block that monster or a or you have like a big huge spider ... or ... or\n... ... ... and ... and also what how do you call it a a your ear zombies and all so Frankenstein\n\nOr just wondering what you thought about dogs well you've covered a lot of ground there Stan I'm because every one of those categories you brought up\nProbably has a you know twenty thirty movies each but um those are some of the best B. movie categories wouldn't you say Mr ...\nCertainly yeah and I would think putting them in order you've got you've got the ... they're universal classic the thirties starting with a Dracula and Frankenstein\nAnd then there's that kind of cycle out and then in the fifties they started making movies with giant creatures and you have your ... your giant bugs and your giant you know everything was were giant giant giant critters of whatever kind\nAnd then that kind of went into the nice little seventies where we were kind of sort of conservation all this you know we're thinking about the earth and how we're treating the earth and what Howard\nDean who's in your mouth awesome nice I'm Still here then we have stand as Mr ... still here\nNo I hear and click or we're gonna have to have split it missed a low back on the phone it is funny GV you and I had taught were talking just a couple of weeks ago I had brought up the movie with William Shatner back ah with all the miners who was ... was was it a spider island or something like that or you're the mayor ...\n... and I don't remember which but yeah that was that's a that's a that's a good one has money magazine eighty or Ninety two or ...\nYeah it was just a very low budget movie just endlessly and they were taking over everywhere and one of the final shots and sending the plane flying into new looks down everything's covered in Web stand which of those categories is your favorite\n[noise] I I start out with a B movies\nBut then I grew more into the zombies and all so or even your your Frankenstein uh movies too and and the comical ones with the Frankenstein when you deal with the Abbott and Costello\nOh ... well that happened and just double meets a meets Frankenstein is one of the best man yeah men men was good because that when that film took a Bela Lugosi it took a it wasn't porous Carl off as the monster I Can't remember who played the monster and it was um a launch any junior\nBela Lugosi it took a it wasn't porous Carl office the monster I Can't remember who played the monster\nAnd it was um a lawn Cheney junior as\nLyle a tablet um Gordon Talbott ... the ... or the Will Smith character and those are the three other than than the non Boris Carl off a character those are the three that played those original monsters in the in the original movies and in fact something that a lot of people don't realize because a ... a\nBill to go see us so connected to that Dracula character\nThe only time he played that direct you look character was in the first film in Nineteen thirty one and then again in the Abbott and Costello film in which I think we may have been made forty eight even\nUm those are the only two times he ever played that character he was Dracula in another movie uh in Nineteen forty seven maybe called market the vampire but he wasn't really a vampire in that film\nYou're never get any more or wherever off mortgage no more\nYeah that's funny Mr liberal I think we have you back here um see\nI'm back I got kicked out the the I don't know where I got knocked down [laughter] we were talking about\nGiant giant bugs or not I think I was working I get to the ... and the movies about what that monster and good foot\nYeah that's where you were as you just started that okay then that's it and we're all caught up\nAh there was that there is is um be a sing there too and that kind of we got a taste of that in Nineteen sixty but it really didn't come into its own I Would say until kind of recently\n\nWell you know it's always been there and and and and I think definitely would lie to the living dead marks the modern zombie movie I as a you know and then uh as far as the new rules you know it used to be that his army was always kind of a ... you know either they were really they were ...\nWe used to call them goals because zombies and movies were Haitian zombie Bhutto's on right um and then uh then then then goals got dumped zombies\nAnd then there were all the Romero films and then in the eighties there were the offshoot with all the return of the living dead movies and and a similar movies so you definitely had a run of zombies and the seventies and eighties\nAnd then they then they kind of went dormant in the nineties with few exception and then in a two thousand and got kicked off again live but I Would say twenty eight days later a kind of rejuvenated the the interest in in zombies even though they were kind of rage zombies\nOutrage virus hobbies but definitely I think that sort of idea of like a global epidemic where you know you've got people shooting ... shoot their neighbors you know I think that um resonated with people and I think from from that point forward um you know that protects us all the way up through the walking dead and everything else\nStand thanks so much for your comments and your phone call um we uh I was just talking about the classics you know the bill Lugosi the borders Carlos the lawn Cheney junior films are made up the universal stable\nUm they are in many ways quaint by today's standards if that's the right word um but they're still just as they are labeled classics\nOh absolutely you know the ... it's not always about scaring it's about equal spooky or creating atmosphere you know spinning yarn telling a story you know uh so you know I mean you know horror is not just one out\nNow it's not it's not just about jumping out of stroke like chainsaw there's so many\nUm so many flavors and there's so much history and um and it's and it's it's ... it's a rich history and those films are mythic and every year\nHere discover them it's not every kid if a certain kind of kid who likes to go to\nFour year old kid discover them it's not every kid it's a certain kind of kid who likes the kind of\nWill and I I think it would be nice for Hollywood or whoever else to look at that and get away from and lately some less so many years it's been is is jumps scare movies\nThere really is a lot of the movies have even had a great story lines and the older movies had great story lines and they didn't need the gyms here\nI think that that's villains in general audience you know I think in in the old\nDays it was so difficult to make a movie and you had to do so much planning because every frame of film costs so much digital\nFilmmaking of so inexpensive the people jump right into making a movie before they\nEven have all the all the concepts nailed down I think that's why the last three Star Wars movies have been a mess you\nKnow and you could tell they do in GV and I imagine you know 'cause everything's\nNegotiable everything with the next ... you know it will fix it in post ... you know oh okay you\nKnow we can't get this actor will will CGI this actor oh this guy blink too much to take his blanks out\nYou know I it's either in those days you either got it or you didn't guy was in the can or was it and I think that um you know because of the the rate of difficulty of making a movie the bar was ... incredibly high and people could clear that bar and I think that's why those movies were so good\nAnd Jamie and I have talked about that in the past two where a lot of these newer movies it seems a lot of times almost like they change directors mid mid movie because the end or they're just they have no idea where the story's going to do and they just they're deciding everyday how this thing's going to end up\nA wealthy\nAgain you're dealing with franchises and they're not they're they're movies are put together like I think the court t._v. is doing so well because movies are getting put together like TV shows used to be where the producer called the final shots and a director and um you know it's the producers movie and it's like okay you know how many toys we got it all on how many\nYou know Happy Meal there have you ever we got how many characters we got to bring an end of this and how many um you know does it have all the elements that we want us to have and you know\nI'm sure all the scenes to make the trailer look good and you know [laughter]\nAnd then they tell you the trail and a lot\nOf stuff it's a lot of stuff that's happening\nOn the top level um and uh the directors disposable\nYou know and most of the time lately the trailer usually has the best scenes in the movie and in anyways\nYeah and that's and that's really that's really unfortunate because the ... the trailer should be just sticking your baby toe into that world and drawing un and making you want a guy and and you know when ... when you're sitting there in the movie theater thinking oh great I Wish I hadn't seen this scene twenty times\nBefore coming to the movies and this was a pivotal\nFood and this bill you know so um yeah it's it's a it's really unfortunate because I think that definitely is out there is a lost art keep making movies in a lost art to marketing them you know I think about what Ghostbusters came out we didn't even know what the name of that movie was going to be you know it was coming to save the world this summer and just that logo", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "31"}
