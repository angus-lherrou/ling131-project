A. N. T. S. as am\nAnd I will say I I met George couple of times if a nominal phenomenal person and um and honestly it was it was mind boggling to me that he knew who I was we're at a convention together going back years ago and we had somebody come up to the table that to me and Steve\nAnd the guy sitting in Mr America wants to talk with you and at first it just didn't click we will then we're like oh my gosh we walked over and he knew exactly who Steven I word and everything and he was just the most down to earth nicest guy in the world actually signed a bunch of stuff brought it brought it over to me and I still have it here um\nAnd she just the way he was and it just one of the most phenomenal people to to know him to talk to and just one most down to earth individuals I think I've ever met that that's involved especially with what he accomplished just to be so down to earth was amazing\nAlways always and never never got mad and you know that what you said right there is a sentiment that as a I'm literally you'll never find out here a bad\nWord spoken about Georgia Maryland that maybe his ex wife ... but you know a ... anywhere I went to his funeral and um everyone got up it was very it's more of a memorial and a funeral and everyone kind of got up you know I mean everybody was there all the Pittsburgh people you know all this is John Russo for\nThe night based on all those guys and then the Toronto chapter was last chapter\nEveryone got up to them I told some story and all of them started the same way pretty much where they were in all of this guy this myth this God\nAnd then they ended the same way with everyone just saying what an incredible gentle soul he was and how when you were with him didn't matter if there were a thousand people in the room you felt like you were the only person in the room because George gave you that attention\nYou genuinely liked people which was strange because he got burned so many times of the industry but you know he really really liked people and are you always felt special around George and it was always genuine it wasn't forced\nOr let's go to the phone line this is Nancy from New Orleans Nancy welcome to be on reality radio\nOh that's friday night what's on your mind so\nI'm I really enjoy your cells and then it it is that a\nOld thing John right like what is um ... you are and where that is the you know ah with the exit says it's scary it's ever seen and then I saw the movie\nYou know ah with the extra ... ... it's scary it's ever seen and then I saw a movie for instance I think it was called lighter which split up and you see that it's killing\nYeah and we're going to see how I I I've seen murders once I'd never watch it again it's just incredibly brutal movie\n... and it's so I my question is where it is or their ... their separation in the yard where because you know horror thriller science\nFiction to sell or are they all say I'll ... I'll answer jak\nDraw an all in all interject I'll say this first of all I'd never\nThough we're talking about or are we throw the age where it around a lot I don't really even like using it I mean the idea of\nGenre period as a marketing tool that some studio executives developed in order to easily sell a movie to the public so the the word horror I mean how do you even define what a horror movie is I mean some of the scariest movies I've ever seen in my life are not considered horror movies generally but I think that they are um\nSo your perspective is completely subjective so\nUm I don't think there's any clear divide as to what defines what a horror movie as far as what's the future of the genre that's kind of the age old question I think the only thing that you can say definite above the future of horrors that there there is a future in there always will be because again we just keep dying this is kind of a problem\nWe have we're just die you know and so a horror movies again\nOr or the clearest reflection about those ... and as long as we keep on dying they're going to keep on making them um and there's not just one type of of of horror movie I mean you mentioned already I mean\nA completely opposite films a martyr as being on the polar end of the the the far end of the spectrum here where it's just such an extreme movie that's designed to make you to hurt you\nUm you know and I the other day I watch Thirteen Ghosts William casts a movie with my kids and just you know it's a wonderful movie but it's completely the opposite it was designed to be gentle and charming um it's still a horror movie\nI'm an ex still today I mean ... creation we mentioned that I actually liked it I'm Sorry you didn't but you know it's more of an elegant restrained horror film compared to some of you know it's leather face for instance which is coming out just the around the band which is obviously going to be more like visiting an appetizer or with a chainsaw\nAnd um [noise] you know I mean these are all horror movies they all kind of fall in that manner and yet they're radically different\nLike the human senator [laughter] so I Love the human I use the ... python sketch I think it's a comedy [laughter]\nMy yeah my toaster Steve during me onto it one day he's like you gotta watch that she stepped on like why am I watching the just war but I Can't\nBut I Can't stop watching exactly you got to watch it to the end and out of prison within a quickly run out of time here in my list of questions is way longer than the time we have available and I got to make common here because there are people in our audience you probably saying hey why are you talking about horror movies you guys talked about paranormal topics and I happened to", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "30"}
