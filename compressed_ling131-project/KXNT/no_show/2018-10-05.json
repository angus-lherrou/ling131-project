I did to get through\nHi Kathy how are you are I was oh Cathy for you I'm going to pick you up on them and just going to drop you on your beach the where your guide to take you [noise] um so the first thing that they show is that you you know\nHow ... so family around you is important but it looks like you carry on a lot of tradition with you and your family and then as you're walking forward kind of away from the water up to the beach there they've passed that represents those who passed over [noise] and you are walking and you've got these\nLike two or three women behind you from my perspective I think there's two or three when behind you\nAnd as you're walking there kind of whispering like don't forget this oh don't forget that will make sure you say it like this and make sure you\nDo it like that like they're they're feeding you little tidbits like reminding you of this is how you do that or it's funny it's I think it involves food and family and tradition and as you're walking you're like oh that's right don't ... don't forget that part so it's just funny how I'm listening\nTo them and they're kind of bickering amongst themselves and you're listening and ... a walking up the hill but on\nYou do have a lot of people who have passed over but they don't come through singularly they come through more is all ward [laughter] it's like there's just a whole bunch of them and they are they're loud and there's quite a bit of glasses ching like if\nJust a whole bunch of them and they are they're loud and there's quite a bit of glasses ... like if they're doing like\n... or ... or something and it does smell a lot like food like I smell a lot of food around them and you\nYou seem like you hold up big table like it's I'm just like\nWhen you have family you fill a table but there seems to be a lot of people standing behind you that you don't see and so this also represents you I'm Carrying on tradition and\nAh the memory of these people being spoken about quite a bit so much that they're constantly there laughing with you so it's pretty cool it's pretty neat to look at 'em and that's what's coming through for you to start you know what they'd be I think it takes I think it's been watched banging the table when I'm reading the\n[laughter] the bridge animated or because you mentioned which was thankful hooked I helped out and begin sometimes these messages that you've you tonight's\nOh don't make sense immediately and then the makes sense for a couple of days or maybe weaker months down the road let's go to Melissa Melissa who's been waiting very very patiently in Connecticut a militia Iran with Rebecca foster\nHi Rebecca I'm good Melissa [noise] okay so most of the first thing for you to know is that this is probably just a little too earthly you know the earth the message but it's about you and money saving money and putting money away\nAnd that it feels like a lot of what holds you back right now is financially related and that\nAll of the choices that you want to make look like they're based on how much money you have in your account and you want to move forward you want to do these things that you can't because the money's not there are the money's not available and so um the financial aspect of things is um\nUh like of what seems to be important\nFor say and now it's funny because I don't want to say that all of our choices in life are based on money because we can't take that with us we can't take any of that with us [noise] uh but\nA lot of what you're doing you're basing your choices on right now is finances so we have to sometimes take our circumstance and say this is what my this is the hand\nThat I have right now so I have to figure it out I have to figure out the best way to deal with this situation and in the meantime put that money away for when I Know I Need it but it's like there are choices\nSounds like two or three and they feel like life changes like direction and what you could do to earn money and what you know where you need to spend your money who's got them it's like it seems like everything around you right now\nBears\nSome form of wave dealing with money and it's definitely not a way to go through every day worrying about if you can move forward with something based on your financial situation so don't don't\nJust seriously\nDon't even focus on that any more focused on what you have directly in front of you with the resources you have directly in front of you for people happiness choices and and and let the rest of it go and eventually if you ask for what you needed will come so hope that kind of let you know that somebody upstairs yours you\nMelissa thank you very much for the call up we're going to go to Julio and Julio is on the road\nClosures no dome or the ... and I'm not one of my favorite song you did that you'll you'll will to show your own Rebecca\n[laughter]\nHi Julio [noise] okay so you're on the road so I just have to\n[laughter]\nHi Julio [noise] okay so you're on the road signs that defined your energy figure out where you are I'm the first thing that comes through for you right away is a little girl and um\nAnd it's funny because I'm seeing new and like a a blue or it's like a navy blue or dark color shirt and I would look at you and I think you've got to be taller broad shouldered\nAnd I'm seeing the young girl maybe in our tweens you know late um wait wait a um you know early ten [laughter]\nThe only way I can put it which she looks like to me\nAnd um\n[noise] that was just ... [laughter]\n[laughter] going on and so [laughter] [laughter]\nAnd so it's just uh\nThis connection that I see of energies spreading or energy spinning and it's something about\nA book or having something written and provided for her I don't know if it's a diary or a book of some kind but passing on\nOr bringing ... this this girl that some ... I don't know if this is the daughter or a nice I don't know why this is this really strong connection and they won't let me see anything else but you and like a book or something written and her does that make any sense you ...\n[noise] [noise] [noise]\n... are you okay so this is your brother's daughter\n[noise] [noise] [noise] [noise] [noise]\n... I\nAsk your brother ask your brother if he would have had a daughter about ten or eleven years old and I'm Wondering if you've got this little girl around you and the only or brother would know if he had a daughter that was lost ... ask\nHim if like ten or eleven years ago that was the case and then when it comes to the book she's definitely saying writing something so if you are a writer or a

for you is that one you're on your beach or barefoot and you're in like this long and it almost as an iridescent down where it\nPearly white and transparent and it's like a gown and then almost as if it's got a long robe over it\nAnd it trains behind you you are walking forward your hair is down you have no makeup on everything about you is very simple and playing which represents face high faith in high spirits working in your life and\nThen the outfit is non forming says this is also say that right now and and being the person that you are the things don't\nYou you don't have any personal fears that are going to hold you that right now and the fact that you're barefoot says\nExternally people in situations aren't going to be like okay you can't do this you're not you're not good enough

decided to invest in and that includes yourself as well so I Would say start those projects he's been putting off right now is the perfect time is absolutely\nLike a perfect time for you to make you very much for the call we appreciate it\nThank you were going to go next to shoe was in Colorado shoe Europe with Rebecca foster\nHello how are you Hi Sue Hi okay\nLet's take a peek at you hear so the first thing for you or they drop me off by your house now the house represents you specifically you are the house and as I Walk up to this house the doors open\nThe windows are open your curtains are blowing in and out I'm Andy this represents when they when they set this up like this that tells me that you are a person who is very open friendly inviting and you allow people and you bring people in was it was very carefully just like you\nYou um\nDon't mind people show well I don't want to say you don't mind people\nWas it was very carefully just like you you um\nYou don't mind people show well I don't want to say you don't mind people showing up unexpectedly because that may not be the case however\nWhen it comes to people even if you're busy doing something people are go you're you are willing to take care of them and take them in and help them out now you're not going to keep them there for laws because you have things to do and they have to get out because\nYou don't want to be brought out you've got you know you've got things to do what you if if you see somebody truly in need I'm going to say looking at your energy that you will give the shirt off your back\nBut you don't just donate and give just to anybody's face it has to be a true real genuine need before you do that you're like well he's fine you just don't want to do it so you know you\nWill not just give to somebody who isn't at least trying to get to get what they are looking for you're not going to hand him the carrot\nSo it's also um\nYou are also a very busy person when it comes to and I know I have to hurry this up but looking at all the things that you're as big as this garden is you have the ability and the wherewithal to really\nPhysically spiritually mentally take care of people um but again you do have holds a bit so that people aren't constantly feeling so weak that they can't do it on their own and there is there's this strength about you that I think people would come to you because you're honest are open and you want so\nYou know that I'm Sorry right\nOkay she sent you so much for the phone call a fairly ... which means in Colorado let's go to any who's in Florida hello Amy welcome to the program Hi Amy or you know I can hear you are you you sound a little we'd be waited on hold a long time were you\nKnow are really smart kids are getting through so oh wow have you done tonight Yes sir I think it's kind of a godsend so\nWow I Would say you're from\nAmy Amy this man hey So Amy I'm it's so funny because I I don't recall even talking to you so this is awesome what um the the one thing I pick up with you is that what what you need\nTo watch right now and well there's several things so first off looking at this energy that's coming through you are um you might be misunderstood or have someone tried to make you look\nMisunderstood ... almost as if I don't know if they're going to be telling\nFalse alerts about you or miss guiding other individuals opinions about you but this is something that you need to overlook and a lot of times what we will do is when somebody hurts us we think oh I just wanted to like run a trucking run them over you know but of course you're not going to do that nobody's going to do that we don't want to give anybody ideas but\nA lot of ... if you just kinda let things do you let it go and you send it up to this is really hurting this is upsetting me I'm giving it to you the universe does find a way to deal with people who are mean and he just ah who lash out an attack others and so\nIf you can just let go of the pain that you're hanging onto because people just think they really do and um\nDon't fall down their level don't put yourself down to anybody's level who is caught and I knew or who is not being true to you as a person don't don't put yourself down their recognize it and then say is close to the edges you have to to keep your eye on\nThe person don't don't put yourself down their recognize it and then say is close to the edges you have to to keep your eye on them but don't don't lower yourself to that level so I Hope that helps you out\nYes and a lot of the thank you so it was\nJust no but so\nYou know thank you for the phone call Amy I'm and you're lucky to stump for Troy so we didn't have a reading ... ah Rebecca that's why you didn't recognize the voice shocked she got through in in a good ... um her call dropped on her phone so why shouldn't paint yeah\nYeah All right so let's see here is a good time for one more which go to Jennifer another call from Colorado He Jennifer welcome to be on reality radio you're on with Rebecca foster\nHi thank you for taking my call\nHi Jennifer you know what John I'm just tell you this you have got such an amazing godly energy around you but I just have to tell you right I mean I don't want a freak you out but people that have your face\nAnd your drive for spirit and I'm not talking religion like you don't have to be going to church every day I'm Talking about here and how you relate to God and who you ... you\nYou also have to know that you've also got other things around you as well that are on the darker side and so you have to be aware that there are there and that they may you know a lot of times if you are helping others spiritually or your guiding other people's usually you're trying to do your best\nPath spiritually they're going to be there to try to trip you up to try to stress you out give you in that you just make you feel like you're being attacked\nAnd so I think what the message is just to let you know the one you're not crazy and to you are doing the right thing you just want to make sure that when they are that when they're there when you sense that energy around you you're just telling it to go away you know when I when I was getting an attack a little while ago I was doing the show right here and I was like\nI turned around and like just you know I mean I'm not right now I'm On a show like I had to tell it to get off it was going to be cute and so usually I'll just say like kids the fleet of Jesus and go to hell or something to\nDo what you got to do and and I think what I'm supposed to tell you tonight is that you are recognized and so just keep doing what you're doing helping people spiritually\nOh thank you I really needed to hear that that makes so much about what I didn't feel anything and I think you needed to hear it\nAwesome well thank you so much for calling in\nYesterday to Jennifer a lot of callers from Colorado tonight um I don't think we have time to be
