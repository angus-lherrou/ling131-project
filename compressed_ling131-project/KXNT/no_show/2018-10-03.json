seven six six number if you'd like to join our conversation we're talking\nWith Frank Joseph about his book military encounters with extraterrestrial the real war of the world\nAnd Frank this is a short segment because we went long in the last segment but with all these encounters that we're talking about there always seems to be an uh an aerial craft involved have we ever had any of these encounters with some maybe a soldier like encounters with\nOwned or maybe something that wasn't a craft but something in in the in the oceans are something that was not ... an aerial craft beach\nOh yes most definitely a far as those found in the ocean as they're known as a U.S shows are on a ... another Bible submerged objects are there are quite common a there have been some very serious confrontations between does\nAnd the U.S navy the earliest back in the latter days of World War two\nOf the destruction of the submarine or\nA score and that took place back in the Nineteen sixties\nAnd that was associated with a U.S all a very we have a very credible are excellent um I Would set to that to us maybe I Would say another officer but a man aboard the ship that was involved in the searching for the remains of the score and after it was destroyed\nAnd then as far as confrontations on the ground yes there have been some very frightening incidents or a ... one of the probably the the most disturbing of all took place and I do see a which is an underground base [noise] excuse me\nThat was described in which there were a confrontation between several hundred\nSeveral hundred uh eighties and several hundred a combined us a air force and army personnel mostly air force personnel all of the eighties were killed\nAnd all of the uh humans were killed but I think it except for about four or five survivors\nUm shall we won that battle but just barely and said that's described in the book also I'm rather a disturbing\nOr others involving a ground troops especially in the Soviet Union\nUm where there there have been losses are mostly I'm On the ... as far as I Know exclusively on the Russian side as far as I was concerned\nReally interesting All right so we're going to take a quick break the phone number is ... four four six eight seven six Ninety until friday for four six eight seven six to nine years ... G v beyond really reveal we'll be back after this [noise]\nWhen you don't mean to be with your best interest they're still\nGreedy me these weapons killing each other\nThat they would if they made their president moon and they just appealed to reach in general I Would think that would be a big benefit for people to make sure they're they're pushing for more world peace than\nThan constantly you know being being at each other's throat\nI agree with you I I I completely agree I think that makes a the greatest fence why that is and has not taken place I don't know\nUm I I like I say it's very difficult to second guess or another intelligence species for God's sakes we we can't even establish a species contact with dolphins who are a highly intelligent species but um there there are communications skills are still far beyond anything that we understand\nThat let alone something from that evolved on another world who knows how far away\nUm it it's very difficult to drive second guess these are creatures they may have a certain agendas though that uh\nWe don't understand I mean look at a on a beach for example a beat belongs to an incredibly sophisticated society a highly successful society and yet that's impossible to achieve any kind of a\nA communication with this highly advanced society we may be dealing with something at least is complex is that\nA lot of these encounters during wartime I'm Talking about one of the world war two ... more ... more ... recent conflict\nHave used them donors ever involved ETs taking aside in other words are affecting the outcome of a battle between 'em into ... armed forces\nYou know that's an excellent question and yes there have been um and and the strangely enough\nThe most recent is in the war in Syria there are numerous UFO sightings going on right now in Syria on on all sides are being reported I have some of them in the book as a matter of fact\nAnd the eighties have been shown possibly would appear that they are siding with the\nUm the Syrian Government against the rebels there have been some incidents in which um the Syrian Government found itself in a very difficult situation and these things intervened\nAnd ... the rebels and this one particular local area and I I cite that in the book\nAnd that is very rare I'm there does not appear in the past have been many incidents like that um I Can't think of really Truman\nBack to ancient times there was a battle that took place I won't go into the details in which two immense armies or Roman army and the Persian army\nWe're about to clash and they would have been terrific bloodshed when one of these craft appeared and uh so uh ... the opponents on both sides that the battle to not take place so that's an indication not that they took sides except but they made a stand for peace there they did stop\nThat uh that that lots on extremely well documented the example by the way one of the best\nFrom the ancient world from antiquity that's we're talking about a ballot took place two thousand or would have taken place two thousand years ago there been a few others like that in which the UFOs have appeared and have stopped conflicts from taking place\nBut a very few like the Syrian example where they have shown to taken sides and apparently they have taken sides at least in a few instances in the Syrian War against the rebels\nAnd we're going to find her ... year and I wanted to spend a minute I personally that story tell us about the battle lost\nThe battle of Los Angeles took place in early Nineteen forty two in which\nA one or more other than to fight craft appeared over Los Angeles we're down to fight\nBy I'm a civilian a rather excuse me why are the defenses and they were these craft were very slow moving made no sound whatsoever and they were caught in the uh the spotlights the the beacons of the defense\nAnd were fired upon by um anti aircraft over a period of many hours\nAnd after this a confrontation took place the United states government came out and said that it was all missing vacation that nothing had taken place at all it was just jitters after Pearl Harbor and so on\nBut the military new ... new totally differently the collection of ah eye witnesses eyewitnesses by the hundreds to that incident indicate that there was something a knot of this earth\nThat had floated over Los Angeles and I'm a scapegoat the a concerted a ground attack fire of the defenses at that time\nAnd um it's it's a really terrific story and even people that are that are still alive today that are people that are in their nineties\nStill talk about um these a craft that really resembled more UFOs and certainly a any bombers at that time the Japanese did not launch any attacks at that time the United states did not have any aircraft uh over Los Angeles at that hour\nAnd a so we're we're talking about um an intervention from\nFrom elsewhere that took place and I go in I devote a whole chapter to that I think it's just absolutely fascinating the photographs from that time of and analyzed and they do show 'em your characteristic UFO like to a a a dinner plates ah put together\nThese large disks that were flying or it's really remarkable story\nIf we continue on we're on the we do create these wars weather in the United states country and we start to break down those barriers ... what do we expect what do you expect from\nWell I think they extraterrestrials are going to have to make a determination uh whether they're going to welcome us as a fellow um neighbors that are now\nSpace together or or else they're going to look upon us as intruders and as a potential threat and given a earth's history humans humanities history uh I Would say that we're going to be probably regarded as a threat\nAnd ah I I shudder to think what ... what could possibly occurred or if there is a a determination by these other creatures in the in the future probably the near future that we are a threat and\nUm I I Hope that that does not happen but I think that that is going to be inevitable\nBut do you think though if you walk under some sort of some of the way it is a piece that we would we would as we started to follow that path a little more\nWell let's hope that possibly there was a treat it can be made and uh\nEspecially if if we if our leaders understand that we're up against a power far greater uh than anything we can possibly amass\nThen we may be able to mend our ways I mean I I'm not an astrologer [laughter] I Can't tell what the future is going to be but uh it's it's ... it's disconcerting it's disconcerting and they're like you said there have been deaths already\nI'm more on our side than on their side\nAnd um I Hope it doesn't escalate into something far worse in in the future and the generations to come\nOn the human race just over ... years we've definitely become more peaceful written I understand you know ... knowledge you know millions of people at one\nBut you don't see the violence as much as it had been wrote histories real really why wouldn't agree\nWith you at all I think that there is terrific violence going on I don't mean not of the kinds of ... dabble pieces that we had the civil war or anything like that but when you look at the civil unrest\nAnd that goes on around the world I don't think there's a single country or even in the so called a first world or industrialized world that does not suffering from a\nSocial violence on a scale that has never been experienced by our people before so I I tend to disagree with you on that I don't think that we are showing ourselves as a peace loving people or people that have have learned you know when we have\nShown that failure for example in the United nations to stop a\nA local horrible fight like in Syria that's claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and continues to claim thousands of lives or the war in Afghanistan that has gone on interminable eight for such an intolerable length of time claiming continue to claiming lives as well\nSo I Would say that um [noise] no we we do not a present ourselves as a very peaceful species we never have and it would appear that human nature is extremely um bellicose in military but I'm so we'll just have to see", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "03"}
