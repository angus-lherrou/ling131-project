pretty high profile their members of the church of Scientology and the whole thing is just routed with mystery and\nI'm intriguing been maybe even some cloak and dagger stuff going on there but we're going to get the street story from Nathan rich who are actually experience the he was assigned to all just for Seventeen years before he was able to escape it\nYeah and I'm not sure we'll ever get a straight story about Scientology but the one religion scares me\nYeah and I just I just want to say that I used the word escape I'm not sure that the word he's going to use I don't know so I didn't mean to put words in his mouth but um he's no longer a Scientology\nSo makes you tune in that's going to be a great new great show but our guests are so far has been one my little cat and been talking a author magician we've been talking about his new book son of chicken ... so thanks for joining us one\nWell I'm happy [laughter]\nWell that's good [laughter] I have a happy yeah\nSo we just have a couple more questions we just couldn't get to an amount of time we had in the first hours and that's why we held you over and I wanted to ask you about the book you had 'em on the back cover or the words initiate yourself what does that mean\nOh well that's exactly what it means um [noise] the um when we think of initiation we think of a I'm\n[laughter] me neither\nYeah hey how's it going guys thanks for having me while I'm show thanks so much for coming on\nYeah so I I just uh you know I I I spent a lot of my time and Scientology\nEspecially as a youngster and uh I wanted to reach out to your show and kind of let people know some of the experiences that I had when I was young especially with regards to ah how I was raised to believe that\nYou know a reality was especially having to do with things like spirits and I'm ... the un and those types of things that I I definitely didn't have a what you would say standard a belief system when I was growing up\nThe um the slip talked about Scientology for obviously that's kind of the the eight hundred pound gorilla in the room how long were you a member of the church of Scientology\n\nSo I was born into Scientology back in Nineteen eighty two and I stayed\nIn Scientology until I was Seventeen um my family was I I'm what's considered a third generation Scientology this and that my grand\nMother was a Scientology just my mother my father my aunts my cousins at every single person in my entire family or with the exception of my grandfather was a psychologist so I was in for about Seventeen years um and I never was sort of officially out of it I just\nEnded up being homeless and disconnected from and and eventually just sort of wasn't around it for long enough to say well I guess not a Saint Paul just anymore\nAnd that that's a big thing though when\nIf you are well stop associating or connecting with Scientology they sort of disconnect you from your family\nAnd everybody else who you know that's involved is correct\nYeah so I mean I I had you know a pretty long\nAnd uh abusive relationship with with Scientology that kind of got its tentacles down through my my mother and and the family to um\nYou know wrecked lots of lots of different aspects of my life I was sent away to a ... an abusive boarding school\nUm for a total four years as a child\nI wasn't allowed to communicate with my my parents ah my my family in any way for three of those years\nUm you know parts of that story where on the a any TV show a leader remedy Scientology in the aftermath um where I appeared as a guest so little bit of that has been exposed but I'm basically\nYou know like you're saying it it it really comes down to\nIf you're not going to get with the program of Scientology once they have enough people in your family sort of been doctrine aged into its um believes they'll start to push you out\nAnd then you'll be you know you'll be the the the black sheep and then eventually they won't even be able to communicate with you anymore and then you'll be what they called disconnected from\nYou mentioned an abusive boarding school I'm assuming you meant you you're talking about the ... Kingsley ranch which is part of the Scientology organization if I understand it correctly why were you sent there and how was it abusive\nSo when I was eight years old um I had already been sort of pushing back against Scientology I'm at that time I wasn't pushing back against that sort of beliefs of it um I was just\nWant it to be a normal kid I just wanted to go and play I didn't really want to take part in um Scientology practices and auditing and that kind of stuff and my mother was very very devout\nA Scientology just and that was\nIn some ways offensive to her and and really upset her and so she had heard about this place called the ... Kingsley ranch which was in Palmdale, California um and we grew up you know I grew up in Hollywood um we're always kind of in LA for the younger parts of my life and so it was very convenient for her\nThat you could send you know Scientology his parents could send their kids to this\nCorrectional ranch and then when the kids came back they'd be ready to be Scientology again was sort of the pitch and so she sent me out there when I was eight years old in Nineteen Ninety um and I was there for eight months and eleven days\nAnd the you know the way that I was able to leave was that basically my grandfather passed away and I got taken out and\nShe came once a month to visit me I'm at you know she had moved to Glendale\nAnd the ranch was run by a man named Wiley Hanks who ah was an ex marine he was a Vietnam vet very large man very tough very um loud and\nThere were several punishments there at the ranch I'm In you know the very baseline punishment or\nWhat he called Suzie cues which were essentially push ups that were military squad jump ... push ups so basically this very elaborate and difficult push up and so [noise] um he would give you know twenty five of those push ups for something like\nYou know cursing so that was sort of the basic uh punishment and then the punishments went up from there so then you have like hard labor chopping wood that kinda stuff time alone\nSo that was sort of the basic uh punishment and then the punishments went up from there so then you have like hard labor chopping wood that kinda stuff time alone less food not being able to communicate with people that's where it starts getting into the sort of medium level\nThey would they would actually withhold food from you yeah yeah of course right and they would put you on like a rice and beans or even down to rice and tortillas if you are really um you know what they consider bad\nWhen you when you say time a woman are you talking about being on isolated where they're mocking new somewhere away from everybody or how does that how does that go\nYeah so they separate you from the group of kids and staff and then they leave you with one staff member they calm staff members but then this case it would be a security guard and basically you're just there with the security guard who\nIs not interested in talking to you and you ... you can't communicate with anybody else or go anywhere do anything so you just basically are sitting there and then the conditions that you'll be given to sort of how you can get back\nWould be you have to do Scientology\nYou know ethics handled links which are basically range from things like doing a lot of um physical labor to like a writing written apologies and going around and getting people to sign you don't forgive you in ... in in ... assigned this paper\nTo allow you back on the group and all that kinda stuff and that wasn't even really liked the punishment that's just sort of the ah that's kind of the warning stuff the punishments where we're actually much more severe than that um and so the standard\nSort of heavy duty punishment ... at the ... ranch in Palmdale was what was called the board of justice also called the paddle and this is where um they had\nA meeting each day which they called the mustard which was a military term and then they would read these written report so you can have something called ... which was like you know\nOh ah ah Jason did a great job helping these sweep the floor today and then they say oh they're great job Jason and then they just moved to the next report and then that was so that's ... and they had another kind of report called knowledge reports\nOr or K ours for short and this was the inverse of that so this would be like oh I I saw Jason you know a punch another kid in the arm uh this is true and so\nA wall e would read those allowed\nAnd then he administer the punishments\nSo I'm for fighting they had a punishment all basically some of the more common things had had specific punishments but there was like go to punishment called the paddle and that was where you would you would stand up in the middle of this monster you bend over the Ottoman um put your hands on the Ottoman\nBend over and you look at these this picture of um Lafayette Hubbard Heller H. L. Ron Hubbard the the creator of Scientology you so you'd be looking at this picture of him and then while he would get this big wooden paddle off of the wall\nThat had all these noxious a on all around the remedy that from kids who have been paddle before you\nAnd across the face of it it said board of justice and he would bend you over and he would hit you\nI'm In front of everybody hit you in the in the butt in front of everyone and if the kids that were suspected of having padded their underwear with toilet paper if like for example if they thought that they were it was going to happen to them and they tried that then he would also make you take down your even your underwear while\nIn front of how many people with this happen\nSo the ranch in those days was relatively small so there was about a maybe Fifteen to twenty people and that includes a security guards are female are teenagers\nOh it's a maybe Fifteen to twenty people and that includes a security guards are female a teenager's males teenagers and then I was only eight years old and there was another boy there that was about nine years old\nSo it was definitely a way of demoralizing you in front of your peers and others\nYeah it was a way to shame you and um you know shame shame us and to punish shots\nAnd so that paddle that's you get three of those paddles is the basic there's no one paddle or to paddle so that time that I got paddled that the ranch was or what Wiley called\nPlaying with fire which was actually when\nMyself in a Matty dig and the other nine year old kid there\nUm had we had found a cigarette that the older boys were smoking in which they tried to smoke it and so that he called that playing with fire and paddled us well that's one example of the punishments there and that was the standard I spent there was even worse punishment and that like a ...\nBut yeah so it wasn't a fun place\nWell our guest is Nathan rich author an ex Scientology list and we are talking to him on Scientology views on past lives a communication with parents UFO experiences near death experiences and so much more on the phone number is eight four four six eight seven seven six six and I get into a free day for four six eight seven\nYou know the ones that I Know I can tell you very much that this is a\nThese are things that they struggle with I mean I I Know people from there that\nCan still cry at any moment just thinking about the things that happened to them I mean these things were\nThe ones that I Know about were real and I know she made his TV it's kind of you know it's it's a little bit weird because it's always you know it's going to be one side of the issue and that kind of thing\nUm you know from my point of view I you know I loved my mother and I understood reality to be that which Scientology says it is I I was a Scientology is\nUm and to me is kind of like\nThat those things happen to me my messages in ... oh Scientology is a hundred percent bad in every way we shouldn't you you know care about those people or anything like that I'm not what you'd call sort of an anti Scientology\nIs I'm just a guy who had a kind of a rough life and I want to get my message out and say hey here's what happened with me hopefully you know you can learn something from that some maybe something will be useful to you you know my personal lead my message is not specifically\nAn anti Scientology a message\nWhen I Know what you mean you can't have 'em anything I wouldn't imagine you have much if anything good to say about your experience if this ranch and um and I don't want to get back into it but that sounds like a horrendous experience\nYeah I mean you know as I say on the program overall Scientology was a very much a negative thing in my life um but you know as I say I'm not I'm not on I'm not championing some kind of a you know right march against them or any right\nUm I we were going to run at a time so I Want to get to some of these other topics um you've had a near death experience or tell us what happened\nSo when I was on the streets as I mentioned for seven years I got into a lot of\nDrugs and you know I was proper homeless sleeping in trash cans and wherever and I got into heroine and I owe deed on heroin I'm at in in somebody's apartment they had invited me to their apartment to to do some drugs with them\nAnd um and I owe deed on camera actually she was filming it she wanted to make this documentary and I counted down to ... uh from five after I injected and as soon as I hit I think it was too\nUm my eyes sort of clothes and they open again in my mind was how I describe it muted it was muted like um you know I could sort\nOf feel and I could sort of thing but I didn't really have emotions and everything was was sort of clamped into this very small level of awareness and understanding and all I could see was this hazy whites everywhere and there was no shapes and the time necessarily and there was no\nUm there was no real reality outside of that although I knew that I was myself so I knew that you know I wasn't some\nOther being I was me but I had this very limited understanding and and um emotions and I was just observing this sort of warmth and and and sure ah you know fuzzy white and this and then basically\nAnd I was just observing this sort of warmth and and and sure ah you know fuzzy white and this and then basically that that went on for about I'd say what felt like about Fifteen seconds and then I open my eyes and there was a nurse\nWho looks quite agitated who was a a trend it sticking IBM me and a bunch of police officers everywhere running around and everything like that and\nUm and I they they took me off to jail and I later found that that that girl that was with me and she said that what happened was um\nI fell over and turned blue and purple and gray and she started breeding for me and I for what she recalls is ten minutes I mean we're in the suburbs slow and um yeah then that the nine one one was called that came to get me everything like that and that was one of the first\nA major events that slowly took me out of the sort of homeless life you know\nNow you um again trying to get through some of these questions before we run out of time you I'm In your book talk about a past life experiences as well right\nYeah and I don't want to spoil the title the title of the book is sites to Aleppo which is a\nYou know goes against every rule of naming books and that it's hard to remember hard to spell it has a a word that isn't real but I'm the reason for that title I hope that when people read it they get to the end and they say there's no way he could have called that book anything else um the title is based off of\nAn experience of remembering past lives and how those past lives um relate to my what I then thought was my mission to expose a Scientology too alien um civilizations\nA so this is in other words while I was getting processed and Scientology one of the things that they really tried to get you to do is to remember past lives and um\nI had done that as a few times and one of the times that I remembered past lives is what leads to the title of the book\nUm so that's definitely has always been a part of my life and to sort of put into perspective how I was thinking about those things a lot of your listeners and a lot of people out there you're kind of living in this world where if you believe in past lives\nYou're kind of the weirdo you know you're kind of people there like um I don't know if that's true you you kinda have to always stand up for this idea where I Will you know how I was raised as that of course there's past lives\nEvery one I knew knew that my whole family knew that you know the religion that we thought we were in they they knew that it was just of course it was the obvious thing and so um you know is very different nurturing environment for that those types of past life beliefs you know\nAnd also your mother claimed to be able to communicate with your cats and spirits and things like that when you were younger correct\nYeah so my mother ... there's a couple of uh books that my family wrote about her after she passed away which they use the proceeds from those books ah to support Scientology so you should be aware of that um\nThey wrote some books about her when when she passed away she had two websites passed over pets dot com and uh\nUh I think the other one was called the pet com dot com or something like that and her job was to essentially communicate with um animals that you know you needed some help or had passed away now that all happened after she had disconnected from me so I didn't know about that but when I was\nA kid um in chapter one of my book I talk about the two cats that we had and you know um there was an incident with one of the cats and she\nUm you know always presented herself as being able to communicate and\nHad and you know um there was an incident with one of the cats and she um you know always presented herself as being able to communicate not only with pets but also with Dayton's which is Scientology has worked for spirit so she could communicate with spirits\nAnd and pets and there was even an instance where I'm I kind of got a bit testy because you know she was my mother so I was accepted it but then there was a time where I kind of thinking and I don't know\nAnd I actually threw her I'm asked I said hey you know at this these statins these spirits they can read my mind right okay well tell me what I'm thinking and I'm In the results are are in the book but but basically she was able to I feel\nAccurately tell me what I was thinking and I and I am very aware of suggestive tactics or you know magicians and uh all illusion is all these types of strategies and um you know I don't think she did any of that so pretty convincing in my mind\nNow what Scientology view though on a psychic abilities or just being sensitive and being able to communicate with the other side\nThey are they very much they they don't specifically discuss it in public but the culture within\nScientology is such that you are expected to get these gains from Scientology on the way that she presents you know presented those\nGifts to me was that she got them from Scientology and then of course in the um more secretive ... Scientology it's very clearly laid out that through Scientology again all kinds of magical powers including a including telepathy\nAlso in other words they in that belief systems most to empower you enough to give you these abilities\nYeah of course that leaves a lot of a lot of problems as as far as you know why why do they even bother asking for money if they could prove that they can do these things you know they could probably raise a lot more money doing that you know that way and et cetera so there's a lot of ah there's a lot of questionable claims that they make\nAnd I don't even really know where I where I live with it but um but I Do know that there was at least one time where\nWhere she had totally convinced me that she could do it um and I wasn't looking to specifically to prove or disprove her\nYou uh we're we're gonna run our time you're ... you wrote the book with the book is not just about your experience would Scientology your book covers your entire experience where Scientology course of course part of that but it's also the addiction and it's also the\nUm homelessness on a lot of struggles that you went through overcame to get where you are now\nYeah exactly so the book starts out a exactly like you said it's it's a memoir and the angle of the memoir really is is is how did I get through these difficult things and how did I ended up\nHow am now which is not will say amazing or anything but certainly better off than I have been so it's a kind of put into a little perspective", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "19"}
