back to the whole where you were asking about the which has only been to which is what I mean there's just a small part that fits into this larger concept of this of the stereotypical which these

was just you know the the hammer\nOf a ... at the time very bigoted faith coming down on them\nSo a lot of this is the kind of the imagery of Halloween ... that we think of the the women the the which

minutes with Paris\nIt is is um so you know how we're all kind of battered daily with us essentially terrible news by manipulative and corrupt media that has all of the um incentive to keep us divided you know for clicks\nAbsolutely [laughter] you know say yeah so so this is a spell to kind of counteract\nThat built up gold from\nAll that psychic nonsense that we all taken every day and you know you just kind of\nArgue with somebody on social media and you know the friends uh friendships dissolve people get blocked nobody's happy right you know that whole thing\nAbsolutely [laughter] in general and it seems like we're inundated with more and more of an each day each month\nWe are so what the witches kid he has to get back to your question it's a spell that I Do wear 'em you allow your kitty cat or your puppy puppies worked great for this as well uh but you sit with them and you\nEvoke just some kind of deep\nEmotional reaction in yourself either through you know watching a video or listening to us\nEvoke just some kind of deep emotional reaction in yourself either through you know watching a video or listening to a song or reading a poem or just watching a scene from a movie just something that you know\nIs going to get you to you know really have an emotional purge\nOr what happens is while that's going on your my kitty cat will start offering her little head off\nAnd she'll just recycle that that that pent up gunk that that that psychic nonsense that doesn't do any good for any person she'll just recycle that out into the world as companionship friendship and love that just is perfect little kitty magic it's amazing\nYeah now I have no gas at home but I got three dogs so it'll work with them\nOh absolutely in fact the more puppies look better if you have three dogs get all three of them on your lap [laughter]\nAnd that could be all and\nThere's something or yeah there's something that'll really started deep emotion and new and they're going to feel that because you're you're you're puppies your three dogs are going to be sometimes they're more in touch with your emotions than you are and kitty cats certainly are\nSo you you have to let them help you in that way sometimes are so anyway ... that's the long answer of what is the which is ...\nYeah now another one has a another very interest these are great titles Greek names for the smells another one called tickles spell to align the law what's that about\nSo remember earlier when we were talking about the Guinness world record sure\nThat whole thing so the pen Nichols fell to align the law is based off of that capitalistic principle of or the natural love uh uh the law of natural governance where you have\nBetween you and the land you have community friendship and a family or friends and family and you serve yourself you serve your family you serve your friends you serve your community and you serve your land\nAnd all of those will serve you wouldn't find it further acts as a funnel\nThat kind of brings your inner world to the outer world and allows the outer world into your inner world so that you can more comfortably walk across the path of life you've chosen for yourself in shortage just saying be a decent person to those around you as best you can in a chaotic world\nYeah Tom and the other's smells that um you want to talk about that you want to highlight the need to think it can be particularly effective for people\n[noise] um I Do but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to use some of the language on your\nProgram [laughter] okay All right\nSo I'll I'll I'll do what abbreviate so a chapter five is called a micro dosing spells two and a whole yourself [laughter] okay um if if I can move forward with that term measure so uh what this is is it's just a\nA a number of spells designed to temper the ego so that you\nYou know take pause and reflection in your daily life and I'm not ... you know hopefully default to negativity although again I struggle with that as much as the next person but again that's why I developed the this magic around it so that I could combat it\nAnd I'm so part of that is being a better person a lot of ah what my magic has to do with is just trying to be a vet the best version of yourself as you can be\nAnd um that has to do with on a holding yourself sometimes and not retaliating and not you know just you know brushing things off like the minor you know\nHolding yourself sometimes and\nNot retaliating and not you know just you know brushing things off like the minor you know uh you know knows flicks from from life just learning how to let those things go when just move on and saving your energy I'm for you know just more important endeavors like\nYou are a slice of the of the cosmos you or a micro dose of the universe you you you know do something like\nThat [laughter] you know that's awesome like good for you [laughter] yeah do something with that\nYou know I I I think especially in today's society we're all so busy we're all moving at breakneck pace is um ... in it and certainly if you have a family a spouse or children or a you know certainly a lot of your time is devoted to them as well but\nIt seems a lot of what you recommending is you need to take time for yourself and that's that's got to be there has to be an allotment of that\nKind of seems to be your overriding message\nWell it it's a it's a close but I Would say that it's a it's more accurately it's to own your own magic like you are a magical being\nA youth you know try owning that and and seeing what that's like for you and seeing how that works you know ... it's ... yeah that's mostly what the book is about I mean the ... just you know rubric that just you know\nYou can apply them exactly as they're written or you can modify them or you can ignore them or you could say wow this book sucks and throw it in the trash like you can do whatever you like with them\nUm but you know ... at the end of the day as long as that is your magic that you're bringing to the world and that it's positive world and that is ultimately going to be a good fit\nTom you've already written several books you a speak publicly uh uh quite often on the subject so we talked about during these last two hours what is next for you do you have another book project in store what is your public speaking schedule like give us a little bit of sense of what these next six months might be like for you\n[noise] sure so is next week and uh my partner and I will be driving up to Vancouver uh for the spirit plant medicine conference which is just going to be a fantastic time uh we just got back from tour but we have to plan another tore a for um [noise] this coming April\nAnd um there's a whole bunch of videos that were making as well uh we're trying to put out at this point a video at least a week or every two weeks but um you know we're we're we're doing our best there and uh yeah just preparing the speeches and uh for a upcoming talks in the course\nWork in the videos be seen YouTube or other places\n[noise] uh yeah you too as a psychedelic which YouTube page uh there are also uh some of them are on my website psychedelic which dot com or they're also on my Facebook page which is Facebook dot com slash the psychedelic which and yeah yeah\nYou mentioned that you actually you go out on tour um how long does typical tour last\nFor you so this ... this a previous one was only a a month and a week uh but my tours ... they're not too bad maybe I like between two and three months\nWow so you're on the ruins tenuous like\nI'm a ... twice or so a year yeah that\nIntervals yeah usually in in the fall and then again in the spring and then the summer that's when ah you know all the conferences are\nOh a year

you know it was ... ah proposals for those as well\nFind a question for ... um any new books in the works\nA yes or my partner and I are going to most likely be doing the follow up to micro dosing magic\nAnd uh I'm also working on my uh third book on a dealing with psychedelic history which is called wonder child\nAbout um the it was the research of the Nineteen fifties opposed to the later stuff yeah there was actually in academia there was a small revolution\nI'm ... revolving around the LSD and medical awesome things like that\nUm that unfortunately we're we're later when I was seen as a unsafe\nBecause uh you know truthfully some people were being unsafe with them\nAnd um but many words and it's unfortunate that you know it's a only a few swelled up for the rest anyway that's what one of the child is going to be about\nYou know one of my other interests besides what I'm doing now in in in talking with you on a beyond reality radio is is baseball and\nI don't know how to follow up close you follow baseball but there was a pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates doc Ellis who rather famously claimed that he pitched a no hitter in Nineteen Seventy", "show_name": "no_show",
