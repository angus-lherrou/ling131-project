side of this coming a break and this is Jeanette in Illinois he Jeanette welcome to the show\nAnd kill you so what's going on\nOkay um I ... it's the first time I've listened to your program I was looking out for a a ... ticket radio station and I caught your conversation and um my mother\nWas put to death against your will in the house that are living in her bedroom she was more food poisoned by the court was wrongful death or I\nI Love my love of course in our mosques and experience in the house here um when I was living in her bedroom\nOr the angel late night that I had a um both turned off in the morning and normally I Try to get off that was the beginning of experiences I had\nAnd then um I have security cameras in the house and I said these white circle of flying around the house\nHe's out some large summer small or some of the one big ways was an adult I made a like an altar from my mom her picture and across some flowers with the Bible and the little stuff is that the lamb\nIn her bedroom and um I saw a security camera or they call them or today and I didn't know that language care like never had any of those type of experience before\nBut this law circle I caught in the security ... what was going around\nThe um\nLoggers picture and the cars on the Bible and the land or it was abnormal um it was going real fast the times that it would slow down and go fast again and I never seen anything like that was very obvious and the camera\nAnd it just so happened that um [noise] this wasn't a charity\nBut on on the drop will tell she was in the paranormal and she told me that it was called like or so I started out as the Internet looking about or said different experience well then I'm One day\nAll right out of Internet looking about or sold for ... well I'm One day I was going to court\nOr I was walking out the door and I forgot like key and I ran back in the house all um I\nWet your ritual the keys and I still can't show there\nIt was a very loving comfortable harmed all\nI knew that I knew that that I knew that it was on um I just felt to presidents real strong\nBecause all of how it felt like it was the only white you're the wrongful death experience all\nAround\n[noise] it was very special to me I didn't have no fear\nAt all ... up you know I felt for profit for all the house even though you're asking for the body\nUm but I felt a project we're still forward still house like she was she didn't want to die\nAt all because like I was forced out of the house here by the court and they grow up on the eight or ... or she would put the White House as it gets to whoa\nQuite a few UFO stories um big foot stories I have a few um cryptic stories that wouldn't necessarily fall fall under bake foot stories or in my last book I did a section that I just entitled glitches in the matrix\nBecause it was story that that really didn't necessarily apply to ghosts or scripted UFOs but just strange occurrences that have happened if people\nAre and you know only in the past ten years out of people started referring to things like that as as much as the matrix the matrix movies but ah I ended up having a sexual of of those stories as well\nUm I Want to share something very very quickly or when I was a child of my one of my best friends had a little sister who was done two or three years old at the time and she used to\nPlay in her bedroom and would come down and I spend a lot of time at this a friend's house because our families were very very close and she'd come downstairs and she said hey mommy I'm playing with the shining lady again today and um she would say this over and over again or you know for months at a time that she was in her room playing with the shining lady\nAnd a couple of months into this um the my friend's father was a social sleep on the couch or in the same home\nWoke up in the middle and I knew so all of a woman in white glowing basically in front of him which kind of a told him who the shining lady was your kids have a propensity to uh she this stuff more often than maybe adult to do or experienced it first is there any difference between when a kid will see versus what an adult will\nUm I yeah I Believe and especially in in you know interviewing people and talking to them I think kids are more open to that and maybe the the veil as dinner for them and they're able to see\nYou know things that that we can ties were older um but I definitely think that the children are on are\nProne to seeing every day either side if that makes sense I I've\nI've caught several stories of people who said that they had an imaginary friends when they were younger of and then found out that there was a child but that Mitch match that description that had passed away you know in the house or something of that nature but yeah I definitely believe that\nWhen we talk about that often on the show where children ... children are more open than adults it's a ... to a child anything's possible and it's not until we started telling them that they're invisible friends not real and we start conditioning them to our belief system and the that shocks them now\nYeah exactly yeah that is that is for sure and and also I mean if you ... you know people who have a home I'm One of one of the things that I Believe as I grew up\nIt was experiencing things it even though my parents' best efforts and what they thought were doing right what's the shut that down and say no it's not hard on it or you know don't talk about it\nYou know it it can kind of stifle a kid they can help them not cope with it well because they have to cope with it on their own but recognizing that and being able to allow them to talk about it and and and helping them understand I think\nI have to cope with their own their own but recognizing that and being able to allow them to talk about it and and and helping them understand and I think it's great for kids\nAll right let's go to another listener call this is Mary who's also in Utah or he Mary welcome to the program\nHigh now my question is where John I'm offer from Utah and I'm just curious if kids ever had the experience has what hops how\nI have not no I have not had any experiences with those I'd love to hear what you've hurt though\n[noise] I Love actually I've got I've got a couple of different times in a story like that edge of that I'm In the seventies there was a wild rather and forget that caused a whole lot of under ... lake up there and it caused several people to die and drowned and for shopping\nAnd if you do you can usually get easy to lose a screens and people calling for help it's a pretty wild price up very highly for Jesse co\nMary who knows yeah I'm Sorry\nThe name of that again I'm Sorry\nIt's ... ...\nThat you've done some of this isn't this the investigative work yourself costs me ... and the I\nYeah I have we've been up there several different times it's pretty crazy wow\nAnd and uh I don't I'm not familiar with the with the geography of Utah very much but where are we talking about this particular location in terms of bridging land that we've been speaking about tonight\nIt is a an odd thing just off of highway a benign you just have to go out to a private um walkway just go up there is a little bit of a ... and the air force on the right when you just kinda hang up in there that it's pretty quiet and it's it's crazy\nSo is it all part of that is it part of that area known as ...\nI'm sure it's just never got that area I referred to that\nOkay I'm Sorry you said ... joined us just a little south of it\nYeah just a little south of that down and I know exactly where she's talking about though but it is it ... itself so that it I Can't knees or my first book this party with bridging but yeah I Do I Do understand exactly what she's talking about no\nThanks for the tip and thank you for the phone call Mary we appreciate it very very much um we only have a few more minutes with you a John you um the second book a ... was released recently\nYeah in September the ... of September and are you working on another one I Am\nYeah I've already working on this summer book um I have a ton of stories that little thing actually spending quite a bit of time interviewing new people and so I'll I'll keep going as as long as the stories keep going\nWith John told me about my son has there been a lot of big savings in the in this area in Utah\nYeah there is actually in fact um it's it's interesting because when they pull out a map of um\nThe cash national or which is on the force that\nThat kind of the main parts I'm In a caf rally or people who have come to me and given me their stories about that um I can draw a circle around um where a lot of these people have seen it so it's really concentrated in in a few areas\nAnd I find that interesting because these people don't know each other you know necessarily of the other people experience is but it always ends up being you know out oh twenty five thirty mile radius\nNecessarily of the other people's experiences but it all ends up being in a out oh twenty five thirty mile radius so I found that really really fascinating\nInteresting the area I'm obviously the whole uh western part of United States has a deep a tradition in a Native American cultures does that ... lend itself to any of this paranormal activity in any way\nYou know it really does because I mean I I have one story on in my my newest book of a gentleman who was on a hike 'em spent the night alone on a mountain called mount male he and he came into contact with a creature\nI'm In the middle of the night\nA that was it was about four feet tall I'm ... green gray and color or homemade old clothes Eighteen years corny features on his face and [noise]\nAnd I mean he really was frightened by this which anybody would be um and when he came to me with this story and I recorded it I think kind of ... my curiosity as too because I never really heard anything about this before\nSo I started delving into it and come to find out that the Native Americans have a\nSpeak of this these creatures and they call them the ... is one of the name of that the try one of the tribes years\nAnd they explain exactly and\nWhat it what he saw um these creatures living in the mountains they like to steal things cause trouble um and ... which is very interesting to connect than the Native American law or just something that had happened to somebody fairly recently\nThat name unless I miss understood what you said a lot like Pacquiao edgy which yeah you got to save them and I used to say okay All right so I'm familiar with the creature um yes so as as you've assembled this third book\nUm are you spending the geography that you're looking in and how do people submit stories too if they wanted um you know try to be shared\nSo I'm yeah I'm actually expanding I I take stories I've actually I'm On this new one because of my books I've gotten some stories as far away as Texas now um and if anybody is interested in contacting me and with the story\nOr on my stranger bridger Lynn site there's a place there to um submit or a contact information and everything and and so you can get a hold of me that way and I can set up in the interview 'em and I just\nI'm collecting as far as I can and um I just love hearing the stories and and getting people's stories from all over\nNew John do you actually get out there and investigate or do you pretty much just to people's stories and now\nI'm you know I Do a\nFew investigations now and then um a lot of it is interviewing people and the people who have come to me and said oh you know my house has haunted um", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day":
