number is eight four four six eight seven seven six six nine in four months are up if you want to join the conversation with Jeff Majid\nI'm Jeff as a book out is called blood stains the website is blood things book dot com Jeff before break we were talking about uh getting into this murder casts a little bit tell us what\nWas unique about that particular building how it came to exist um and when it was demolished in to make room for a post office\n[laughter] well actually the um constructed himself or had you know contractors phone then stories about\nHow would a fanatical contractors are are some of the most interesting of all\nI'm even a couple contractors that went missing but the location that he was perhaps the most interesting for me it was on the on the junction of rail lines from downtown Chicago\nOut to the lake or the bear was going to be so that every day when the barrel was up and running there would be hundreds of people passing by this little murder castle hotel obviously it in all that\nBut the first floor was retail stores the second floor was thirty to thirty five hotel room\nYou didn't call it that but the first floor was retail stores the second floor was thirty to thirty five hotel rooms designed specifically for visitors to the fair to spend the night\nAnd the third floor was his offices and living quarters I'm One of the rooms on the second floor had gas vents\nAnd with an observation post that homes could watch as he rendered unconscious or stick she aided gas that he had selected for torture experimentation down in the basement\nAnd then his assistance would send them down agrees shoot where another would catch them as they landed on a gurney and prepared them for the doctor I mean you can imagine that that horrible seen to be a young lady waking up from on consciousness and then seeing yourself strapped to that gurney and\nAnd the Dr Frankenstein of America walking up to you in the basement there was a gas furnace that a record the league could reach six thousand degrees\nWhich is plenty for cremation purposes there was acid bass there were light pitch\n'em that you know he was the master of eliminating any evidence and human remains after a murder or ... of articulating a cadaver to sell the skeleton to to medical schools\n[noise] he um you know that's that's what the building was prepared for it was ... it it had a little bit of that uh what's the name of the the place out in California with all the strange\nHallway when Justin mystery mentioned\nRight it had some crazy endings can you uh floors and um it's it was strange it in some places at least that's what I read obviously I've never seen pictures of what it actually looked like\nWere some excellent articles by the Chicago Sun times and the Tribune about the castle when the police actually finally determine what it was I mean it it had been sitting in the neighborhood where years operating as he wanted it to be\nAnd pretty much everyone there thought this was a great place to live next door we got our own doctor in the neighborhood\nAnd I've seen dreams and I've seen drones grams of the way the building was set up everything from secret chambers and hidden hiding areas and it's definitely it's a terrifying center of the people of course who were going there have no ideal of all these these special rooms and the way they're designed and\nAnd all these secret chambers for him to be able to access\nInto your room while you're sleeping\nA when you're looking at it it's just\nIt's it's terrifying it truly is\nWell and think about a young lady who ... you know with her dream is to attend the world's fair her parents give her money to travel [noise] she finds this charming little place with this you know this uh elegant a well dressed man who introduced himself as Dr\nHomes and and she's you know two miles from the world's fair she spends a night and then wakes up to find the horror that's that she's really visited them it's um\nYou know when I as Jason said a make and I went down into the basement for haunted history and obviously it's not the same now the basement of the post office as it was then\nBut there was an energy down below I I don't I never believed in ghost I was never a fan of the supernatural a series\nWas an energy down below I I don't I never believed then goes I was never a fan of the supernatural of theories or even tell you the truth believing in God but that that day that Mike and I went down the stairs with the cruise with us um it\nChanged the way I felt about um life after death the energy is the feeling that you could get on at a place like that which Harper's Magazine you know coined the murder castle if ever a ghost was going to be found and proven it was going to be at this horrible place\nAnd I and I think they're right that's probably the place you're going to find something horrible emerge you know from just\nThe atmosphere and it's a you know the the image that I have is of these innocent young ladies who who the police image gave up on guys because during the world's fair you know they had millions of people in Chicago the police were overworked I don't remember if you recall\nYeah and that was an homes at all I mean the a trial judge after watching\nHomes in interrogate a witness he he um Saturday his own you know lawyers downing conducted his own defense through much of the trial\nBut the judge made a comment to the papers after the trial that he'd never seen a smoother\nMore elegant defense counsel and all his Thirty years so you know here's a guy that never went to law school never practice law never never you know engaged in having a mentor teach him how at trial which which I can assure you you need to have that if you're going to be successful the law\nAnd ah the guy was just a incredible in his ability to step into other shoes and carry out a scheme so [noise] um he he um he was one of a time\nWhen we talk about his crimes did we ever get any number of victims or do we know what the body count was from this man\nNo no and you know I I I'm argued about with the ... over those numbers with many others I mean even um I get threats over a my Facebook page is almost as many as the death threats I get from my\nFrom my theory that he was Jack the ripper you know from\nThe river all just sort of strange crowd to tell you the truth but um when you argue how many people homes murdered\nYou will have numbers from five to nine to Thirteen to twenty seven and then you know you have Erik Larson with the devil in the white said of you\nWho raised you know the number two hundred I'm not sure how many it was but I Will tell you this he had the mechanism the expertise and the knowledge to murder a human being and then do away with the evidence of that crime so when you try to\nYou know argue about how many a murder or didn't murder it's like trying to prove a negative and it's never going to be done\nWhen he cleaned that he confessed to killing twenty some people though he was never able to prove correct\nYou know he threw that number out to her ... corporation they'd offered in Seventy five hundred bucks if you gave them an interview he was a pathological liar hate and he was maybe the best liar that ever lived through that out and then the next day chuckled it away saying that he just use that number for Hearst Corporation\nOkay when we go back to talking about the American river um those episodes there'll be viewed\nI think you can get them on Hulu I think they come up you have to or you can join you can subscribe to the History Channel page\nHistory dot com and I think you can get them there they've they've never re run the series which is another strange aspect that Jason made and you can help them with because no one re runs shows more than history does I I think\nUm they were you ran it in the u._k. and they re rented in Australia\nBut never here in America which\nRaises all kinds of questions which I really don't have answers for\nWill end like I said earlier it was your show which covered a serial killer and it was the zodiac killer was covered a serial killer and any any\nKnow you said earlier it was your show which covered a serial killer and it was the zodiac killer was covered a serial killer and any ah any and everything that had to do with any soon serial killers they seem to\nAbandon the shows that in a rock suddenly the same time so it almost seemed like they were trying to just clear they're washed their hands on that that stuff even though the shows were doing phenomenal because people weren't tuning in for the gruesome details but they were tuning in to try to learn\nThe history of it and understand what could make somebody do this\nYou know I I think at some point they they became reluctant about my theory that Holmes was also Jack the ripper\nI Know they just gone through that terrible episode with Amelia Earhart and that photograph that they had you know run across ran across that serious trying to prove that she had lived beyond where you know the the supposedly credit or hurt and then the Japanese\nMan had said no I took that picture somewhere else I I recognize that picture but so I Know they were they were reluctant to have\nYou know my theory be another Amelia Earhart and maybe that's what it was either I never had a discussion with them and and Jason you know even if I did have a discussion with them I science so many nondisclosure agreements I couldn't tell you about um on your show anyway so\nYeah exactly so ... when we talk about uh let's just take the conversation back to stay here because they want to kind of wrap up the um ... the ... story itself when he was arrested how long did it take from that for them from arrest to execution or\nMaybe I guess I should say alleged execution at this point\n[noise] yeah I was quite a while aid\n[noise] you know he was convicted and sentenced to death\nHe appealed the criminal conviction to the appellate court which wrote an amazing um argument and final decision regarding the um trial itself whether Mr trials should have been called\nUm whether the evidence had ever actually prove beyond a reasonable doubt because in the trial was largely circumstantial I'm I'm getting a little bit into the legal framework here because on my past profession\nBut um once once I figured out where this had all gone when we when I proved that it wasn't him and the grave I went back to the the trial transcripts\nAnd began researching them much more carefully than I had initially and that's probably one of the most complex\nUm integral homicides that I've ever read about or or been a part of for sure and it's um I get a kick out of your music makes when you did the uh\nA few good men I'm a video or audio because I'm One of the most fascinating aspects of any trial I've ever heard about was\nOne of homes is why why is the attorney general got the plain states evidence and testify against him\nUp on the stand and obviously him having been a big um missed his objection that it was a spousal privilege wasn't allowed by the judge so she got to testify\nBut he said his lawyers down and then question her in front of the jury talking to her about love and buried devotion to each other and how it should be ... could possibly be doing this the sending him to his death\nTo her about love and Barrett devotion to each other and how it should be ... could possibly be doing this the am sending him to his death by the neck and it's an amazing part of the story which I Hope someone picks up and we get to portray it to a\nBattle you guys but but our listeners tonight because it's it's right out of a few good men\nSo that brings up a a good point though what is next in your a process here ... in telling the story what are you trying to do and what do you see on the horizon forgetting these messages and the story told\n[noise] well I you know I it's I tell people when they ask me how did that go from a self published book or you know having a television show and now may be a Hollywood major motion picture and you know it's going on shows like yours that uh\nI I have someone listen at a Ted Talk show asked me to go do a show for them and then history was watching the Ted Talk and decided they called me up to do a show about\nHomes being Jack the ripper and um I I don't really plan those things out any more guys they kinda just pop up all of a sudden I'm you know three days down the road something new pops up but\nI'm I'm excited about the FBI a green with me that there are no such things as mass graves in America of identify victims and that with uh the DNA science now we have the ability to who\nOnly determine how many bodies are in that piece of ground but also maybe to identify them for the families that you know follow them and that to me that's always been\nWhat I wanted this to end up with how I could have fulfilled that obligation that someone in my family had regarding those victims and\nAnd I'm going to continue until it until it happens it it's just you guys know that in this\nSociety we live in and the you know the capitalist system um I've got to develop a background of fight finance or share rich that can find something like that and you know conservative release speaking with an excavation\nOf sixty third and ... with you know full DNA testing we're we're talking about many millions of dollars\nWe have um just a couple of minutes left and uh you know we probably don't have time to get into too much is more of the story but you are a great great grandson of each each homes how many other are there are a lot of living descendents or are they are very few\nWell there's quite a few I mean my father and my uncle are still alive they're you know one generation closer to my my father ah donated DNA like I did for the comparison you know with the remains um", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "24"}
