I'm a solar a technology are there are other countries that are ahead of the United states in this effort\nUh yes I think by voting you in terms of inspiration or\nGermany or cloudy country very cloudy ... much more cloudy and upstate New York\nWas leading the world in terms of instilled sort of how many years and now China is just taken over by leaps and bounds said they'll way way ahead in ... comes out to us about ten times more TV and now growing there you\nKnow are they able to ... but they're not to the point where they're able to power small cities are they\nAre I I'm not sure that the intelligence of that program but they are building knives on my foot it will take some that putting it on their ... so that's going to be a fraction of the law and mall\nBiggest ... being a fraction of the power that goes on the electric green so they're not doing it seems at a time they are doing it the whole country as as a whole\nAnd then another question is when it comes to manufacturing um these solar panels you mentioned the silicone as a major component um our supplies of silicon apple enough that we are going to actually be able to\nManufacture these panels in a quantity that we can ultimately as a world are\nYou ... and ... says second or third most abundant material on the planet or every rock is a third of all who said he couldn't so when you take a piece of rock you know looking at ... ... there is city kind of it\nYou just dig it up you have it\nSo as a researcher in a developer a and you've obviously had your hands involved in this for quite some time what do we expect for the next breakthroughs obviously we've talked about battery technology but um is it a matter of just these panels becoming more efficient or is there something else we should be looking forward to\nI I think the technology is here than the next breakthrough he's ... for me we will be a kind of a\nLet's have a plan on regulation type break to\nWe're going going from the moms you know ... that we have today white ... some customers in that field picture soda to the to the next step which she's making industrial power with solar energy swimming is no they're not actually\nHaving the and the government implement laws to to push it\nYes checked changed or the way for instance you write me never ate a kid or what our solar ... changed the way the regulations south are\nIn place today regulations in place today uh uh he uh to to do business as usual and interesting you production say she'd come in with a new technologies which needs to work you know it's tough to get away doesn't seem quite right so that that's kind of the programs household today that the ...\n... ... it's like around the tag on young half square miles down there\nSo walking on the regular actually and um aspect to this is a very important way called the picture\nNow we have a lot of people listening who may be saying geez I really want to figure out what I can do to maybe rode utilized solar from my home or to help a national effort to support this technology what would you recommend to them\n\nBut if you have a home and a nice roof you you could ask an installer to the ball is shot one of the ... companies you mentioned sauce you need to give you a quote and see if it makes sense for you there is a new way for\nPeople who don't have the right route cell with trees on the allowed and all that which is called the um [noise]\nCome into the store I like the model up eight seats by getting started in places like New York than other states where\nYou actually become the owner of a a ... thoughts of allowed to power plant so you and your pros you show I saw the ... somewhere on your own eight seats you it ... goes on the great and they get managed by the utility so that's a nice small hold the future I'd say people\nAre getting fall and then getting old and then uh\nWhat what people the best thing people can do is is being conscious that solar can actually be\nThe it's the biggest source of power for the future most other people have no idea that it can can do they think it's always something you put on your roof fall people who can afford Ethan and that's it but it's much much more than that and people don't realize it so maybe the", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "02"}
