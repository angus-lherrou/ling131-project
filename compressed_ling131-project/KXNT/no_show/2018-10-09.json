up\nScotty that's a very short segment here we've talked about two of your books or if he could just give us a sense of what's the best way for folks to uh to get either the Nepalese more reptilian books or the other books that you've done or what the the best way for folks to buy those or maybe even get signed copies as well\nSure you know you can find any of these books on Amazon or my publisher new page book on all three of the ones that I authored and then there's the two that I was a contributing to anthologies\nAnd you can find them all the new page books has been a bought up by red we'll wiser in the last year so you can check or online at Amazon you should be able to find them um I don't carry many in my own personal possession but I've got a few\nAnd uh I've got my ... book and my book on the exit is a is a I have a few of those uh you can get a hold of me through my website got Alan Robert\nEmperor engine the tick up Roman the Greco a emperor a pharaoh of Egypt\nAfter the time of Alexander and they wouldn't do appeal for him to go to the library of Alexandria to look up all the squirrels and all the teachings and all the things written about the Hebrew religion so they could reconstruct their own scriptures\nAfter uh Israel had been sacked by Babylon\nAnd so now they're they're Seventy two rabbis and they're looking for all the ancient knowledge and they rewrite to reconstruct\nThe scriptures the Hebrew scriptures in genesis you know a exodus of his numbers due to run and all the way through the Old Testament\nAnd I'm sure you know was one of those books because it dates back to the same period where this book was rewritten and so as far as they're being hidden schools in revelation um I don't know that that those\nI was always thought that that has met a fork it's a symbol it's speaking figuratively or these scrolls but maybe if there's a literal elements who might be talking about things that are missing 'em I can only imagine in my head what must have been like\nA ten hour days to go back in time and walk into the library of Alexandria imagined the vast rural knowledge that was in that place\nBut then you look at who destroyed it in the two hundred eighty up the Christian movement destroyed\nThe library of Alexandria\nOr because they believed it was filled with pagan teachings and what it was was yeah I'm sure a lot of that ancient teachings from all different religions and cultures and that's why the Jewish scholars rabbis when they're in the four hundred BC\nOrder to rewrite their scriptures cause him wanting to look up what had been kept at a library of Alexandria\nSo I Hope I get your point somewhere in there\nYou know I\nI'm ... I'm really fascinated with mountain Herman 'cause I'm pretty sure that some archaeological a work that's been done there and I'm not sure how much of the stuff shelters out into the general\nYou know ... you bring up something to my memory and I wrote about this in a uh the rise and fall of them ethylene\nIs that melt are mon or mother Herman where these two hundred and ... we're supposed to have come down the watchers came down the Ben a hot as a team the sons of God came down set foot on not Herman and went in among the human women this spot\nIs on and now you may have heard this before this is on the thirty third parallel\nAnd well what's interesting to note is that if you go to the exact opposite side of planet earth on this\nOh from where mount Herman is and where this stuff was supposed to have taken place a centuries millennia go\nYou know where you end up on the exact opposite side of the earth\nRoswell New Mexico now I don't know what the connection is if there is really a connection or if that is one of the biggest global coincidence is that exists um it's funny to me are interesting to me\nThat that ah you remember bill burns from ah ah the show UFO Hunters\nOn the side fi network or years ago I'm always wear sunglasses the bomber jacket yes yes\nI actually have a Shakespearian scholar believe it or not he uh he majored in a Shakespearean architecture or something like that but uh\nHe was talking to me and he says Scott he says on that thirty third Pearl up is is I Believe that because there are sites all around the globe we're starting to find are connected in Britain patterns\nAre sites in South America Central America England Norway or the middle east the um the uh uh oracle Delphi are all these places are connected\nAnd he says I Believe that this thirty third parallel have something to do with what Bill burns referred to as UFO trafficking\nAnd a well somebody on completely you know ... ... loan that was talking about the late learns\nYes all the way line or our fall fall along these grits [laughter] use me this this nagging cough um but you go on that I thought that was fascinating\nThat the rods well enough Herman or opposite side of the globe exact opposite sides on the thirty third parallel\nPhilip thank you very much for the gum excellent questions a good material they're going to be I think you're paying the price for staying in a camper in Utah\nOr might be that might be a you\nKnow I had this a dastardly cold or in my chest and my throat and then it went away but if I talk for two hours or you know my my voice wears out very quickly so forgive me for that\nNo you're doing you're you sound great um\nWant to switch gears in this final segment that we are going to talk about coming up at the end of the month is is my favorite holiday or festival whenever you want to call it maybe it's yours as well of course how oh yeah oh yeah it is coming up there's there's always a lot of debate about\nHow Halloween got started oh is it a pagan rituals is it something else is it a combination of things\nCan you clarify for us exactly the the true origin of Halloween\nOh boy I'm you know there's\nThat I've studied this before I've actually written about it before but like Einstein says I never bothered to remember anything I can look up so I don't think I Am forgetful I think I'm a genius but\nUh [laughter] I say that tongue in cheek\nUh when I start thinking about Halloween and its origins or I always it always evokes images of Celtic mythology\nAnd uh um I think it goes back even further than that but the roots I studied were in Celtic mythology Celtic legend the Celtic practice and that\nUm we're talking or ancient times and this is where they would have the night of course that would have off demons wear the veil with the thinnest I don't know who figured that out in the first place\nI think you have to have some kind of obvious your connection to it or to to to have figured that one out but what happened eventually was the the church took over that holiday and it it became um all Hallows eve\nI'm with the night before a I'm\nPaul hello I see I I Can't even a graph the exact names I think it was all ...\nDay all the time all saints day yeah\nThere you go and uh all Hallows eve was that the the night that you were\nSupposed to be a guardian yourself against the demonic against the thin bail 'em or the whole tradition of Jack o' lanterns and leaving treats and giving treats and things like that all sprouted\nFrom those ancient traditions of staving off the demonic\nAnd the evil and uh um that's it in a nutshell as far as I can describe it I Would say if somebody asked me do you know all about Halloween and of course they do\nBut then you you pin me down to talk about it and I haven't looked it up again for a while and that's about as as detailed as I can get at the moment\nUm do you leave I'll come back to them and\nPutting aside the the terminology of the bill and in\nWhich is maybe a little bit of a deceiving term but a term that I ever used many times in describing Halloween putting that aside for a moment do you think that ... it is a time when spirits ghosts are more likely to appear do you think there is something to that\nI think there's something to that now again where I Would question my faith in my biblical teaching and all of that for my earlier years because it just didn't seem to withstand scrutiny in certain areas and I had a lot of questions\nThere are other spiritual element that I say I accept that accept their spiritual element to Christianity that even Christianity denies so I Believe there's the spirit elements out there um\nI Believe that there are the thinning veils at certain times of the year\nI don't know why that is so uh only that I that I have read and research and and really in a sense a learns is that that was so but I don't know what though so I'm Still on that fence between at all but I've experienced\nEnough that whole anecdotal experience I've experienced enough of the spirit realm to understand that it exists 'em and someone from my Christian fast like come along and say well you know that's just all demons and they're trying to distract you from God\nAnd I say I don't know that I buy that\nBecause I think the Bible is full of spirit beams and full of spiritual happenings that have nothing to do with the doctrines and the theology um somebody I really liked in history and literature was William Butler gates the poet laureate of Ireland turn of the last century",
