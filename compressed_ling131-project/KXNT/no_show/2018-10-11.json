phone lines rope and if you want to join the UFO discussion ... four four six eight seven seven six six\nNine I'm you know a lot of people have these encounters a lot of people see these things in the sky they're not really sure what it is which is the whole basis for UFO um but it's more common than most people believe in a lot of folks just don't want to tell stories they get a little concerned are going to be ridiculed for a\nWhile and that's that's the the biggest problem is they feel like they're going to be made fun of her ridiculed and a button and a lot of that starts with the media and the government and the way that they really pushed and pushed that belief system and what I brought up earlier to Peter\nWas uh the whole thing about the government controlling the media and trying to make a mockery out of the whole thing and there's proof I mean the government did it was a project mocking bird anybody wants to look it up where the government was running the media they were telling the media what are what stories to put out there for people\nAnd and and all that information's been released now but it just goes to show that that does happen\nAll right so are our guests for the rest of the program as Matthew ... is a looked has looked into the Carbondale UFO ... incident and we're going to be talking about that and hopefully Matthews there you with us Matthew\nHello yeah ... ... they were doing good work on the show Matthew thank you\nBut start by a telling us exactly what the Carbondale UFO incident was\nWell it's an interesting story a beat the story of the ... I mean it has a couple of fights to it of course every ... story does have two sides maybe a good side but\nJust to kind of give you an idea here especially for the uh the audience that's listening in Carbondale study located in northeastern PA a proxy only about eighty six hundred people are twenty twenty five minutes outside Scranton\nSalt again just to give them a geographic location there and at one point carbon that was pretty popular I mean it was a bombing town\nA lot of things to do the atmosphere is completely different today I mean it doesn't compare to what they explained it about ... the is the sixties or seventies [noise] but uh yeah the fall and said that I'm Talking about\nUm I I Would always say it's probably one of the most popular that you would probably find maybe from articles maybe from other lectures or possibly from other sources\nAnd from other sources of a media that do relate to the northeastern Pennsylvania region and I think probably one of the most famous and if it probably is the famous is probably ... SALT I would probably put Carbondale just in that category of popularity\nAre you saying what you're saying it's one of the most famous for northeast Pennsylvania or in all of us folks recordings reports\nI Would probably say just for our northeastern region I mean there's probably a lot more popular stories out there heavier than the Carbondale UFO incident but again just for are you are you know our area\nI'm again I'm speaking from a local standpoint I mean this was a pretty big incident that was always talked about three years and it was always on and off and again I mean the testimony as they can they remain to be consistent\nOkay you want to explain to us exactly the story I Know ... back in Nineteen Seventy four this happened correct\nYep yeah November night Nineteen Seventy four that was the initial start and that was where really the record of activity happened and what I collected from\nVarious resources or from an investigation standpoint word responses or through interview with through survey\nAnd pretty much for the ballpark figure is here it's a span of forty eight hours so we're talking about two to three days a of activity and the story starts with several teenage boys from Carbondale ah they were around the Russell park area which is also located in Carbondale PA\nOh they reported that they saw fast moving object I felt from the sky and came down into the pond\n[noise] it's all in fact what they described um it was a little bit more thorough because they were actually able to see where this object was coming from and it was over in the western region or over sale a mountain which is kind of close to our area Salem Archibald um\nAgain it all connects and it's close to that Carbondale central point\nAnd it was coming down at such a low altitude I mean it was an obvious spot for them so\nThe teenagers began spread the word and of course the town is getting hyper vet and eventually word spreads out through other towns are within the county is near Carbondale and even the word makes some parts to New York and New Jersey [noise]\nI'm just to go a little bit more deeper into it uh before the teenagers are it's followed up by the cops that which leads them over the Russell park Carbondale a police department are able to confirm that they do see a glowing light coming from the water which was described from the teenagers and one of the biggest descriptions was\nUh for the pond they always and I mean the locals could probably go back to a describing the pond at Russell park it was murky was brown it was dirty I mean that's probably due to so much silk that was in that area that's probably cause the coloring of water but the white was very visible\nSo cops are reported on there at the incident they move onto the scene and the police do confirmed that they did see the light and it was at the very bottom of the pond course there was no visibility to actually see like a shape of object\nOr a detail of maybe some type of item but definitely something visible and it was light based and of course uh the witnesses at the scene\nThere's a couple of things that are and of course this comes with a lot of different testimony is I mean you'll hear one thing and then another but some do confirmed that police did fire shots into the water some have said that that never happened\nAnd it seems to me is that the God you know that that definitely seems a little out there for them just to remind me fired shots in the water let me ask is because we're going to take a break in about a minute though you know how deep\n... I Want you to like I Need to get your information can be nice to actually pass your information off to Matthew Matthew what do you what do you have to say about that\n[laughter] um and I think what you're explaining their kind it matches up to my testimony is um now\nI mean just to give you an idea here I mean I've had some failures in in a lot of people that came forward and really what happened was this really just started as a a school project back when I was going through graduate school\nUm I remember my uncle my father talking about this topic and it always uh even when I was a kid and the teenagers I keep hearing about it and hear about like you know I'm just going to do research project on I'm going to do something in graduate school you something I was a portfolio and actually it was a big hit\nHad two other people involved with that we wrote an article and I still have that article but fortunately I have to get it from a originator who actually did start the project from our mentor I'm I could pass that on the JV and Jason\nI'm bought the article was pretty much a twelve page document that just concluded a testimony surveys of what people saw what they've explained the situation and experience\nAnd at what your explain a really goes into the significant eight that we have a collective which we call them subjects one through eight reason we did that was because we never wanted to reveal an identity research\nAnd especially when you're under un I R B ... a A R B approval on everything has to be taken under consider for ethical consideration so as I mentioned ending I Know what you're not worried about I have this I have my ... story because I was to continue it\nOn your the story is is that they've actually came across a native of diversity went by came through the area that he had scuba gear the fire department approved it and said you know it's a resource they allowed a man and he pulled a lantern right out of the lake and of course\nA lot of the people still don't buy it to this day because of you know scientific reason um some other reason from other details that proved that theory\nRight did you have something to do that\nYes well they get into the uh it was a big joke about the land and why why would the military people there are white according off the area and why are you a flatbed truck hall something out with a covered with the tarp and tell her but he was a piece of ... money equipment label Idaho below the whole you know no I wasn't there for that\nBut the ... the person who I was there the night before this all the rest of the stuff transferred to as far as the next day or the day after and the fellow I worked\nWith was a credible person you're living in Carbondale and he and he he told me and when the rest of it exactly as I said\nIt was what he told me they said hold on the line okay 'cause we want to get some information from you I'm see if we can put you guys in touch okay so uh we'll get slip to pick that up\nUm so the story that and just told us Matthew about a flatbed truck with something under retard did you also report\nAbsolutely uh in fact I just finished my last a paragraph you're that I Would have actually reciting you guys um the factor is and even through this experience if you're going to say that they hold a lantern out what was the military presence there for so I kind of leave you guys in the viewers will questions here um why was the military there\nAh what was the truck all about what was under the tarps and why did they tell people if you work to follow the\nWhy was the military there uh what was the truck all about what was under the tarps and why did they tell people if you were just follow those vehicles going out or they would be criminally charged\nWell you know one time and now the\nCriminal charges at that time what are they I have no idea what there was warnings from state police that round fight there and of course from the Carbondale police department and of course from eyewitnesses and and the testimony is they said that your law enforcement were enforcing that\nWell into everybody out there listening and they now when they see you in and they were talking about a six month old railroad type ... correct like a battery operated winter\nThat's yeah that's the story um I I again I Can't really bullied into that 'cause I I just think it's a bunch of ... you\nKnow and why why ... why I'm saying that is because I mean even even a railroad winter and it might be one of the resistance so forth but it's not waterproof and when you drop a battery in the water I mean they tend not to really [laughter] it it's just they tend not to really work that long yeah they don't last very long\nExactly [noise] and um even for this I'm I remember uh my uncle um\n[noise] he was he was really good with this stuff because he worked\nUm with a lot of people in the area with coal miners associations like Verde groups they'd gotten lines they discover equipment\nAnd a lot of the stuff that they came across they used to come across the stuff in the minds the band ones that they've gone they do research and then they try and give it up to the answer site museum here within our area and they said you know for a lot of that equipment back of the day it wasn't made of cheap aluminum\nIt wasn't made of a you know she'd material it was actually made of sturdy steel\nWere metals and the ally is just the way that they made things it was more durable that even goes back to how they made cars back I mean it's I mean you look at the body car compared to a skilled body car\nFrom the forties on it was just a different make it was a different resources at that time and things were really more durable but if you go back to them pulling a lantern out\nAgain I don't believe it was battery powered um if\nYou're talking about pulling something out and they had a hard time to struggle on the first attempt maybe it was something that had something of weight and that would\nMatch up why we had a flat bed there in Carbondale that would match up why we had military presidents did they pull something bigger and just use the land through as an excuse\nYou you're in a sense that they were yeah Mm interesting was there any photographs taken of any of this\n[noise] that's the only unfortunate thing uh I mean\nIt's going through a total and this is what I have a record it's still in word documents um I have a total of Eighteen people but out of those Eighteen people I found the ballot responses and the most significant or just to be around the number of eight responses\nSo eight out of Eighteen were very consistent right on detail one another while others were just I feel like these people came they met they wanted to make a joke that like you guys were talking about earlier you know this is an area where people kind of laugh at the matter of your calls research\nYou know you're looking at crock pot with stuff like that um I mean you kind of have to have an open mind in this subject matter I mean I'm not I'm not trying to preach to people and tell everybody you know out there leaving UFOs you know they they are real what I'm trying to tell people through this experience with carbon Dell's UFO incident\nKeep it open have an open mind or\nListen to what people have actually said listen to the I ... is is that we're there I mean you're going to hear a mix of things but most of them that I've met they are really driving through the story like at just discussed will end do when you\nI mean you're going to hear a mix of things but most of them that I've met they are really driving to the story like at just discussed\nWell and when you say UFOs and I mean we and we tried to make sure everybody's aware of this a UFO does not mean spacecraft to just means is on identified flying object at that time wants to identify it it's not a UFO anymore so when people\nHere that term they automatically take up space then little green men and a radioactive material but again you're right it's just an identify flying objects you'll be could be something astronomical could be something materialize\nMatthew the text Bergen some and how far was that from this ah Carbondale incident\n... would have been almost ten years before that um I Believe that was Nineteen sixty five and that was in December and that's actually pretty interesting story because a lot of people kind of compare cats birds UFO incident\nAs a are Roswell New Mexico and if even if you look up a lot of the articles that a lot of reading on ... that was actually spotted through multiple states it wasn't just in Pennsylvania people have spotted that\nOn identified flying object or Michigan um I think another state listed\nIn there was probably um I think it was New York and I believe there was even people in Canada on the border line there that either witnessed the object and all that matched up to an incident that built up in ... Pennsylvania\n... which the geography how what's the difference between the two places\n[laughter] while we're talking about a significant difference there I mean a tax bird is literally on the southwest of uh area Pennsylvania [laughter] so I mean it's a pretty far stretch we're talking about all of a\nYou know I ... and ... how to use the south west I've driven through Pennsylvania enough to know it's a long big states drives [laughter] and it's got a good coverage of potholes to all\nThe northeast states do any more it's it's really kind of a shame um so what's your worked until now a year is still investigating this uh is there any more information to uncover can we get to in a government files on this incident or did they just not exist\n[noise] well I think that's what it comes down to I mean if you could find this on a new fun I've also found the answer to be recorded drew a new for which is the national UFO reporting center\nUm it is archived I mean the incident is listed\nAs a viable situation I mean it was worked on it was just it was a it was reported\nUm it does have a story but um I mean to find out any government record I mean what they write it off here is I think that the concluding point is a hoax because and the reason they claim it was a hoax with because one of these teenage boys", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "11"}
