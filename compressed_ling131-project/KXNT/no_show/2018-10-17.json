why this stuff gets people going um and it gets nations going at times\nBut if you'd like to join our discussion the number is eight four four six eight seven seven six six nine now something else that I wanted to bring up is that some scientists are talking about a comment like objects these asteroids\nAnd these other giant space rocks that are floating through space and they're starting to believe\nIn a theory that had been a push for ... years ago that these objects are actually the vehicles by which life is permeating the universe\nOkay so it's just that they carry life on them yeah\nThey're saying that uh it's very very possible that um that are microbial life forms\nKind of hits rides on these things when they break off of other other you know bodies planets moons whatever it happens to be\nAnd they uh you know they travel thousands or hundreds of thousands of light years and in some cases they believe some of these things could survive and when they hit a distant planet that's how life is\nUh brought to that particular pointed the conditions are right the microbes begin their life cycle and evolve or whatever happens happens there and that's how life is being spread throughout the universe\nTheir all of them have script and all of them have images of Menorah they have ... life on them which oversee a symbolic of of various things within those those those

itself\nWhich inside the terms of Jerusalem in king Solomon's day in a round about a thousand BC was so us ally sacred that it was forbidden from being actually depicted\nSo I suspect this has raised the reason why the books were actually sealed and then she would wake up soon sealed away in caves\nBut the ... century collection has a has as the portrayed of Christ himself on the front cover and

is a a short segment ... got a minute or so here\nUm but I wanted to ask you about your ah how people can follow your progress with all this website Facebook ... what's the best place for people to go to be able to keep track of your work\nAnd the best place is a Facebook page which is the Jordan disease and that you can you know you can go back and you can see the history of these things you can read that the schools\nYou can you you can go back and you can see the history of these things you can read\nThe articles on where I ship up\nTo do a major a media event the end of November\nAnd we'll be announcing batch owned the page and we have to get a website set up within about the next six months or so uh where are you in the prices are setting up a foundation\nUm all you know people from all walks of life ... famous friends or actors and actresses I'll go eminent academics politicians you name it\nWe want to extend their so called friends in the United states because we\nNeed to create provokes the debates about these things so that we can protect Christianity for the future and and get it away from the control aspect of of of of what people have been saying and threatening us about that that's great better debate and an have some some some some really good thoughts about this\nIn in the thirty seconds we had before we have to go to break when we come back we'll continue the discussion but you've uh you know with these ... right I mean you go into aided them okay so we know what they say does it really matter if anybody else except to them I mean if we accept them ourselves is that enough or not\nI don't know um we maybe we should have followed this story little more closely but recently in I'm In his real a red calf was born\nAnd it was um prophesied is that a red calf would be born and it would have to be I Believe sacrificed in a certain way and that would that would open the door for the second coming are you familiar with that\nA part of the story and do you have any any information and do we know what's going on with that at all yeah I mean\nI I I read the story of a very intriguing they I mean you can check for anything you want from from out of this but let's not forget one thing Christ came to abolish animal sacrifice therefore the sacrifice of this has a ... to bring about the second coming\nIt's simply not going to happen Christ said you will bring an end to it because the animal blood was polluting the temple it's very unlikely that fall that sacrificing this pool of east\nOf because it's perfect is it is going to bring back a God of love of God of love does not want things to be killed on his behalf fall off a and I would agree with\nThat so you know the other thing I should mention as well is that there's this kind of ritual that takes place every three four hundred and Ninety years\nIn the book of Daniel he mentioned Seventy weeks of years which is four hundred Ninety years at least every four hundred Ninety years that the government has to be renewed the landscape has to be renewed the whole idea of the divine has to be renewed\nAnd that tallies exactly with with Christ's ministry um\nIf anybody wants to read anything about this they should read the work of Dr Margaret ... which is very very remarkable stuff indeed and she's quite transformed the field of of Christian studies and what she has to say about that is\nIs very very interesting I I really recommend it\nSo what ... what do the ... say about the future of Christianity and of human kind to general\n[noise] they\nTalk about this event they talk about the covenant review 'em and it's funny you know we're right in the period of of of covenant renewal right now we are now in the final week of the four hundred and Ninety year period\nSo we have until twenty twenty six to actually you know come to our senses an start to look at the landscape around us to look at the bar on them to look at the the you know the mass extinctions and\nTo clean up our rights to to to reach out to the divide and say right we're going to put a stop to this we're going to review we're gonna we're going to preserve\nAnd we're going to change 'em and I think that's very very important and the ... to seize\nActually are talking about this very ritual they're talking about the renewal we've got images all the sweet ... images of the deepest odious places within\nUm Judaism and the Hebrew Islam as it than walls in the period Solomon the disease hawk back to the original capital Solomon and the author of the covenant being present in the ...\nAnd they're talking about us being aware of things around us they told you about us being self aware I Believe very much that Christ\nUs being aware of things around us the Tokyo about us being self aware I Believe very much that Christ's action in terms of the priests fiction and in terms of his entrance of the sample was an attempt to make us elsewhere to wake you up to two who we are\nTo our profit potential and unto to to really won't just save us but to save us for future a future where we have a a better world around us and I think that is very crucial right now\nDavid I'm sure you're familiar with the copper screw 'em as part of the dead sea scrolls in a gym bar fields effort to um actually do some excavation where the schools were found\nUm his his efforts are being met with similar resistance to your so you must feel certain camaraderie which are his a project and uh what you're experiencing\nUntie sympathize with him um I think it's really shocking how I'm actually I'll kill a tree in the middle east in terms of Christian origins is almost run solely on corporate basis by evangelical Christians who refused to give a looking to anybody else\nOr another set you out of your own it's highly political ... tragic actually because at the end of the day all it's doing is promoting ignorance and then the the temple Solomon and in a time of Jesus as\nThe great to save the whole indeed the early ... because it led to everything else was the was the act of ignorance I and I just think it's actually a polling\nBut if these people think that we're just going to give up they've got another thing coming we're going to continue and we're going to push ahead and\nWe're going to get everybody on board including evangelical Christians\nSo we can have ... an open debate about these issues\nSo it in the spirit of forging ahead and moving forward what's next and your uh what's the next step and all of this for you\nWhere we're setting up a foundation and where they're going to widen that we're going to have a an initial can be a sea of experts from across the seals\nExperts you know about mythology corrode from Hebrew script biblical scholars you name it and then surrounding that we're going to have people from all walks of life\nAnd if any of your listeners are interested in this and they would like to be involved they are very very welcome they can get in touch with the uh the the ... Facebook page and we'll be happily sending out newsletters and an an other I'm I'm a piece of information in June calls\nBut the idea is to build a consensus\nAnd to bring everybody on board to debate these things and to put the Jordanian government under pressure to save and preserve the code of cities and play some of the museum so that everybody can go in and actually see these things\nBecause you know for the sake of Jordan for ... her economy\nThis could provide quite a considerable boost in terms of tourist income because Jordan is a very very profoundly beautiful country\nAnd what they have here in the cage disease is very remarkable itself and you know they the government claims to be supporting multiculturalism and they didn't want to support all the religions\nThey've yet to show it in in in practical terms now they felt that child's let's see if they can see the initiative and do this\nAnd what what is the disposition of the ... now I Know you had mentioned they're kind of scattered\nIf I Do this and what what is the disposition of the ... now I Know you had mentioned they're kind of scattered\nSadly I'm we know some of the ones from Israel have been sold off that you know in a sense considering what the bedroom house on his beans are I think it's entirely understandable\nHe's a decent man he's actually preserved unprotected these things are with these other money and you know he goes house involved and he's wanted to buy what they are and he's he's a he's a very interesting man in that sense\nIt in terms of the Jordanian side of it we know they had twenty five cow disease because we saw them in the department of antiquities in two thousand and having\nA unfortunately in late to solve all of them um when the director shipped off the department of antiquities was changed from uh professors yet outside a wonderful man\nTo a a check would want to jump Holly I'm there was then suddenly for whatever reason I rubbery at the storage facility of the tub of antiquities and the only thing that was stolen what code to seize\nA and it seems that they've gone missing I think this is such a tragedy but obviously you know it seems to me that now we've proven these things to be authentic they all with lots of money it's probably will now that they've sold them off\nUm for for tourist income all that they possibly even destroyed them under orders from the usual suspects\nI find it interesting that we get a news headlines actually they're not even headlines are kind of buried in many cases of archaeological discoveries and more often than not these discoveries continue to support what we've been told\n'em at least from a historical perspective in the Bible I'm ... and it it just seems to be happening with more and more frequency um is this a sign of something\nYeah I I think that she you know it it's a sign that the generally um what was written in ancient works particularly Gulf schools was largely true\nI mean you have to be very careful with the gospels because that historically very compact and also that secondhand documents in the sense that they were written by Roman rice is largely a many years off the events\nBut they've got the narrative that on the narrative seems to be largely true so I think we we we shouldn't dismiss them I mean there's been a school of thought in the past ... years will say that Jesus she never actually existed\nThat in fact the whole thing was just a a kind of a set up by a Roman ... rice has like a new or even by people like some pulled himself or that they were Hindu sing I sing um I think that that's an interesting uh angle on things but it's not one that I carry with I think that\nThere is not much evidence but there's enough evidence to suggest that that Christ existed the ... now actually concerned that points", "year": "2018", "show_name": "no_show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "17"}
