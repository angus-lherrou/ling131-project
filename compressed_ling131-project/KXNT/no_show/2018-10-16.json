also going to talk to them about Star Trek books in a bed\nOr David you mentioned that the or at least the first book or the midnight front the first in the news was uh was it was called a ... I'm trying to think it was banned brothers meets Harry Potter\nYeah that was one of the descriptions\nAnd you talk about uh this whole concept of the coal to imagine being a used in in World War two in that particular book\nI'm clearly there's been a lot of talk about uh the Nazis particularly the upper echelon of the Nazi Party Adolf Hitler\nA Heinrich him learn and others being involved in a cult or things you know whether he came down to magic or not I don't know but there's there's there's a correlation there that is part of the history books how much of that did you rely on it at least his inspiration for what you ended up writing\nA lot of it I did a lot of research into the real life connections between uh the Nazis and they're a cult or interest\nOne of the things that fascinated me was that the Nazi Party itself involved at least in part of something known as the tulips society or to the ... in uh the original German\nAnd ah the to the society was basically in a cult\nSociety they were interested in black magic a of both the dilemma variety put forth by Alister Crowley but also in more ceremonial renaissance era black magic\nAnd uh that sort of fueled Hitler's interest in this he was interested in a lot of a cult symbolic gee such as ah\nThe dollar which was sort of a a black son symbol which was a prominent piece of decoration in a lot of Nazi Art and was a prominent piece decoration in his office in vehicles Berg council\nA which is a real setting that I use in the book in the midnight front I have my ... not see magicians are based out of the eagles PR castle\nAnd there's actually a a a sort of a a ceremonial magic area built into I Believe the base of the north tower\nI I think it's the north tower beetles Bert castle and they were supposed to have the eternal flame of the right was going to burn there and they had built\nAround them and our symbol and they had all this other sort of stuff built into the walls\nI'm so in addition to other a cult interest things like hunting for the spirit of destiny\nA and a you know the supposed fascination with the holy grail the Nazis sprang up at least in part out of a society devoted to black magic and that was one of the things that kind of sparked my imagination\nAnd helped me sort of make a connection between World War two which was this historical period in which I've always had a strong interest\nUh ever since I was young and telling the story that involved this system of magic which was something that was planted in my head\nOr as a teenager by a novel that was published in Nineteen sixty eight by James Bush called black Easter and he wrote a very different kind of book not action oriented at all much more hockey uh but the basic premise of black\nI'm a jaded businessman arms dealer type guy hires the world's best black magician to unleash all the demons of hell for one night without instruction or restriction just to see what they'll do and of course the consequences of this ill considered action uh\nAre just as horrible as you might imagine up and it's a really terrific book and I found that part of what really made it work for me and made it sticking my mind was the Bush\nTreated the subject of magic with great scientific rigor you took it very seriously he treated it very seriously and because of that to the reader it becomes real the fact that it's treated seriously and not as a joke\nMakes it feel very possible and his descriptions of very clinical very scientific a and B original language of magic is actually very scientific magic and alchemy\nA where the precursors to the scientific method\nSo you find a lot of antiseptic a ... billion terminology and magic for instance the person who conducts a a magical spell as the operator and the people backing them up or called tennis uh the experiment is what they refer to the ceremony that\nThey don't call it a ceremony they call it an experiment\nUm and just little things like this if you're sending a demon to kill somebody the person you're sending them to kill it was called the patient it's all very antiseptic and strange in this regard but it's because it came out of this out chemical tradition that was the precursor to modern science\nAnd I found that that fascinated me as well\nI I'm I asked this question with the understanding that you may have no idea what I'm Talking about we only have about thirty seconds here I'm divorced or break but when I was young there was a series of comic books known as we're the we're in war or we're at war\nAnd I think I I think I read those I think you and I are probably the same age okay so um yeah so it was a World War two comic\nBook not that it was ... not that I read it in World War two please not that old [laughter] but it wasn't about that and it was set in World War two and it had all these supernatural components to it on dead and other things if I remember correctly it's been a time yeah so when when I was reading the description of a of your first book the midnight front I immediately started having images of that particular comic book\nAnd then I'll I'll spare you the long convoluted stories but over the years I've somehow ended up as his webmaster [laughter]\nAnd now I maintain his dot net site for him and we share David Mak dot com if you go to David Mak dot com you gotta just ambiguous ration pages what it's called and it's got his picture on the left and my picture on the right and I listen to his credit so some of my credits and it says which David Mak are you looking for [laughter]\nAnd if you're looking for him you click the thing and it takes you to his site\nAnd click the on the thing for me it takes you to my site and that was just a gentleman's agreement we came up with a long time ago instead of fighting over dot com and they said why we why don't we just share it because we don't know whether our fans get confused and that happens because one time he did the cover art\nFrom one of my novels and so you want to confusion now can\nYeah yeah um money I might full name is James Johnston so named confusion as runs in my life it's pretty common swingers stand that um I Want to ask one more thing about this a midnight front a idea and looking at risk cover art it makes me think of this\nUm what was the soldier what is the soldiers perspective in your books are in this particular book and I mean I just look at that and if I was a ... I mean I Can't imagine being one of those we Nineteen year old men\nRushing a beach in to enemy fire 'em to begin with if I was doing it and there was a didn't demonic present that I was aware of on the other side of the Battlemind um it would be even more daunting or this other soldiers in your story aware of what's going on with this particular a magic\nComponent or are they kind of obvious to what's happening\nOf them are in the dark most of the rank and file soldiers have no idea this was going on\nThey don't know it's part of the war the midnight front is part of what was known as British as so we special operations executive which basically means there are special warfare they're spies their Sabbath tours\nThese are the guys who were sent in out of uniform behind the lines or to destroy things to eliminate high value targets to work with the French Resistance\nUm so they weren't really frontline troops and the idea behind the book is that the the magic using guys within the midnight front\nThey have what they think of as their war\nThey're the only ones who are properly skilled and capable of fighting the Nazi magicians so that's what they have to focus on although one of these magicians let's say could try to take on a tank division\nAnd maybe have a fair shot at doing some damage before getting killed that would be the a waste of a perfectly good magician when you need those magicians to fight other magicians\nThe ideas that the allies cannot fight the midnight France war for them they can't fight the allies worked for them either so each side sort of has its response\nIf you're that terror you speak of about being the kid charging the beach not to give too much away but the sort of the critical component or near the end of the book is that the main character who has spent all this time developing all this magical skill\nSent into the day for reasons I'm not going to go into 'cause I don't want to spoil it but\nFor reasons that are integral to the story he has to joined the de de landing without magic power without magic protection as just another guy in the boat\nAnd he's got to survive without magic and uh I have like a whole big chapter it's got its own heading at near the end of a it just says you know 'cause like I I have like different ... years but then there's one just for June ... Nineteen forty four\nData and we reproduced an actual a copy of the letter that Eisenhower sent to the troops the night before they launched she read that and it really puts you in the mindset of the soldiers and what they must have been thinking as they hold this letter from like\nAnd then they get sent on the boat and I researched every little detail of that uh for my main characters training with the rangers where they train\nHow they trained what they learned um which boats they would have deployed on out of a women's harbor\nOr what section of the beach they landed on which units scaled which portion of the cliff a cause I sent my guys to punt the hawk rather than Omaha Beach\nBecause a lot of people don't know about what the ... that wasn't even crazier battle where our guys had to literally scale class a hundred foot cliff with won't bladders while they're being\nShot at from above ... and they did it and they did it the rangers did they took that cliff under fire climbing rope ladders I mean that's amazing yeah\nAnd some of the most insane details in that chapter are true the craziest stuff in that chapter you the oh that that's ridiculous true there's like a an account of\nA soldier like they had these things that we're supposed to be they called him ducks they were heavy trucks that had ladders from fire engines donated by the London metropolitan fire department and the original plan was they were going to drive 'em up onto the beach\nThe letters were going to stand all the way up to the German positions at the top of the cliff and our soldiers would just go right up the ladders well it didn't work because all the shelling knocked all this ... loose rock and mud and junk off the front of the cliff face it all piled up into a muddy mess at the bottom of the cliff\nAnd all the ducks got mired in this up and none of them could reach the cliff the ladders couldn't reach\nWell one ranger realized that these guys are getting picked off going up the ropes so he said send me up on the ladder send me all the way up the duck is stuck in the mud it's swing back and forth as the tide comes in is the waves are knocking it around and this guy is writing at the top of the liar ladder like a guy on top of a pendulum\nOn top of like a metronome you know thing and he's swinging back and forth at eye level with the Germans straightening their positions and they can't hit him all they can do is duck as this guy standing on top of a ladder mistreating them\nA hundred feet in the air it sounds crazy guy actually did that\nI mean so then I had to kind of research I do this is why I Love this book I can tell I\nTell you um you know they're they're they're known as America's greatest generation as the really interesting for for a reason and I encourage anyone obviously your book tells these tales as well um but things like band of brothers if you see something like that and realize that these are Eighteen and Nineteen and twenty year old boys\nDoing these unbelievable things I mean things we can't even imagine at this point warfare is ...\nWas that you know it's it's not even less horrible I'm not going to see that but it is unbelievable and I tell my son when he complains about you know the silly things in life I say you know when you're ... your great grandfather was your age who was storming the beach and the German gunfire I mean think about it it's unbelievable really is\nYeah and the other unbelievable stuff that's in the book and it was maybe a little less inspiring and more sobering is I also dealt with the issue of the Holocaust um because that was an important element of the war right in Europe\nUm and uh and it sort of ties into the ideas ceremonial magic and blood magic which is a little controversial but I felt it was appropriate to the bad guys to have them\nSort of go that route but there are a number of incidents in the book that our accounts of things that really happened during the Holocaust where again I went to first hand sources uh accounts by survivors of things like the ... massacre in Kiev\nAnd I actually based those chapters on the accounts of survivors who were there\nSo again some of the most horrendous stomach turning stuff in some of the depictions of the Holocaust people go oh that's over the top no they're really crazy stuff is all real\nYeah we've got about five minutes left here time just flies and having this conversation so I Want to turn the topic to some of the work you do for the star trek series first of all how somebody get involved in and become an author who can write a star trek novels is that something that anybody can do\n... yes and no uh it it takes a pretty weird combination of luck work experience a and just sometimes you know being in the right place the right time\nIn my case it came about through a number of factors starting with I grew up watching the original Star Trek series in reruns are on Nineteen seventies television so I grew up having it in print it in my brain\nFrom the very beginning I had Star Trek imprinted on me like a duck on the imprint son the first thing it sees moving [laughter]\nUh and then from there\nWhen I by the time I went to film school at NYU which was Nineteen eighty seven oh that was when Star Trek next generation prepared and so I was keenly interested in that and starting in their second season they had something called the open door policy for scripts\nAnd I was learning to write script so I Would submit tons of scripts and got rejected I got rejected by them for years and I stayed in New York after I graduated from school because I couldn't afford to get to LA and I kept collecting rejections from a distance\nAnd then it turns out that the company that publishes Star Trek novels Simon interest or is based here in New York and around Nineteen Ninety three a guy who was a one of my college buddies met somebody who is an editor\nAt a star trek books office he introduced us we ended up getting along great he gave me some great advice turns out he had the connections to get pitch meetings with the TV producers\nBut he knew nothing about writing scripts I had a degree in script writing",
