G v beyond reality radio will be back after this [noise]\nSo in my head all my books are really one long book that's broken up into chunks because that's the way you put\nOut information a wave just trying to transfer what I've collected over the years\nYou know nobody wants to read of two thousand page [laughter] that'll get\nMy regards the lawn I Love is workshops and I love his books\nThe over the years you know nobody wants to read it two thousand page mood now [laughter] that would get\nMy regards to lawn I loved his workshops and I love his books a actually a pre ordered his son of chicken ... book\nOh awesome I'm we're excited to have him on the program actually tomorrow night oh let's go back to talking about spirits yeah this time of year a lot of people will dabble with if they don't do it on a regular basis you know trying to contact the other side whether they're using things like we do boards or whatever it happens to be is that dangerous\nYou know it's it's a bad idea to a poke your nose where were you don't know let's let's compared to this a few um\nStart randomly talking to strangers or in in times square that could go really well or could be unpleasant if you decide hey I Want to explore what's on the dark Web and you set up your computer with the tour browser shirt poking around a\nYou know thankfully a lot of times nothing bad happens or either because he didn't run into something\nOr because you didn't have the wherewithal to attract the the kind of energy that would bring something fourth and but realistically I'm the universe is filled with both wholesome and an wholesome things things that are pleasant and unpleasant the best way I like to think about it as think\nOf human beings I'm most human beings are somewhere on that bell shaped curve from a ... somewhere in the middle where they're not they're not a\nSaint Lee and they're and they're not a terrible but you know the sociopath exist to the physical world search your pets exist in the spirit world and I'm using the word spirit to include not just human spirits but all kinds of things and\nIf you\nDecide to experiment without calling fourth or any kind of protection without even if you don't someone or something that some ... wholesome spirit simply opening up of yourself to the flow of energy could potentially cause you some harm\nA thankfully nature tends to uh keep things climbed down but at the at the times of year when things are more open\nA ... as it is this Sunday I have somebody coming over with her sister because she wants me to do a bit of a cleansing to shut down something that she managed to stir up\nIn what is it just mainly because the male is supposedly dinner between our world in their world during this time\nIt that's it is my belief that the veil of center every every a solstice equinox across quarter day every time that's limited all a dust\nCan dawn midnight uh eat actually there's some kinds of spirits that actually are very available at a whole new under the sun not the dead but other sorts of things\nSo anytime that there is a change point of the veils or center and this time of year in addition to there being something that is different ah with the veils how many people are pouring energy into the idea of this is the time of the spirits\nAnd in the same way that when do you know what I mean by that by feeding spirits are off making offerings of candles or food or water or incense were for calling fourth different beings\nWell and I do and I but also I I Know as first now a lot of people tend to\nHave more paranormal or their beliefs are experiences during this time of the year and a lot of them can be chalked up to different things of course the the air just ... just the energy in the air seems different because you've got all the leaves falling off the cheese\nAnd then the urine yeah than can be chopped up to different things of course the in the air just ... just the energy in the air seems different because you've got all the leaves falling off to cheat yeah the trees and and all that stuff but\nThen again a lot of their beliefs that something is going on in their houses more because you know all of a sudden getting dark earlier they're spending more time in door ah indoors ah\nThe heat's kicking on because our throughout the house so there's a lot of those as well but it definitely does seem like a there is higher paranormal type activities to this this time of year as well\nAny time it in ... I guess I wouldn't try ... says how many people on the planet or at least ... let's say just in your city or thinking about paranormal or cold or the dead at this time of year\nOh yeah let alone every network out there playing some sort of horror every time or anybody\nSee those things those images flash in their mind and our thoughts and emotions generate energy\nWhich stir things up so there's a low level build up or just from everyone even if there weren't any astrological or a seasonal changes that open the veils\nOne of one of my teachers or not we can better ceremonial magicians she used to before she passed away years ago she always had a really big ceremony at her house New Year's eve\nNot to celebrate New Year's eve but to a siphon off at heart is the amount of wild chaotic energy that people were generating a partying\nSo a lot of it I guess can also just the masses all all feeling this way can sort of self manifest or at least not even manifest manifest because of the amount of energy and thought that are going into this I Would assume that that music can have an easy okay\n... think of it this way how many times have you seen or read about the occurrence of a house waking up because of a young children or adolescence are moving into a house\nAll that so yeah a lot because of the energy they're giving off\nAnd children tend to give a total different type of energy I adults do\nAnd it's and these are the times of the year when we're allow ourselves to be more childlike and also to open up the heart or energy and our beliefs and our imaginations if nothing else\nEven ... taking this conversation back a little bit with the with the discussion within discussion um use the word magic several times and then you'd magical I'm ... I mean that in a in in in ... since we're more like Disney since we're having a magical time\nOr in in ... in a particular a chance or motions or ritual actions to bring forth a particular energies are caused certain things to happen\nAnd is that something that you do just during a these particular ah rituals that you might do how is it is it is an ongoing practice\nThere there's you know there there are it varies I mean some rituals are are primarily devotional or I guess or celebratory\nSome rituals are more specifically focused on a causing something to happen which is a more magical but there is a magical component to every full moon ritual we do every every seasonal holiday ritual we do so there's there's match I guess one of the differences are in in paganism or Wicca\nOr risk category religion says that there's more esoteric material there's no such thing at least in our covers\nFor there to be a ritual that does not overtly have a an attempt to a move between the worlds or or call upon energies or to ask for a different kinds of spirits are gods and goddesses or Debbie\nThe move between the worlds or or call upon energies were to ask for a different kinds of spirits are gods and goddesses or Debbie being semi divine beings to be president\nDo you feel that the trail of which is um on television or specifically when it comes to like a either documentary or reality\nTelevision do you think that's a ... they've been portrayed fairly\nI don't think they've been portrayed well I'm you know fair is a funny thing because it's it's an industry\nAnd as such it has to attract an audience and it has to have a certain amount of excitement but I better to say that there have not been enough variety part of its representation if you only have a handful of representations and they're the\nSame ones over and over again then basically are not a it's an imbalance representation of what that community what that practices like but\nUh even even when it's a friendly representation it's often a really really off\nKey because they didn't actually consult with anyone or ask for advice or if they did ask for advice because I've had friends that have been consultants for for various things it's thrown out because well that didn't make the show exciting enough so\nI mean certainly there's some that are out to get us from the perspective of because it's not Christianity or or or whatever it is evil or and then there's the other side of of uh\nUsing the the cult or ... or magical part of it as a as a sensationalizing ingredient in a in a plot line\nYou know this sounds appealing to someone and they wanted to explore these concepts these ideas a little more thoroughly uh where would you direct them how would you like the\nFirst thing is a go online and try to look up to see if Google to see if there is a matter of physical work called book for\nOr in your area because if nothing else the a staffer the owners might be able to point you to some books were direct you to some open public events or you can there are actually quite a number of of hotel base conferences and egg gatherings\nOther camp out events that are also all over the country\nAnd show up or what I also recommend this shop around a ... like", "show_name": "no_show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "18"}
