I'm Glad\nMoney to stabilize yeah look listen it goes on to say that you know there's a lot of\nCities are like LA Nashville Indianapolis the different clips their pre recession peak by Vegas is not and you know three Fifteen we're at in June of two thousand and six and guys that we have the time and time again we plummeted to one Eighteen and January two thousand twelve I mean I remember that like yesterday it was crazy\nIf you bought your house in two thousand eleven twelve or Thirteen two thousand twelve fifty you're ... you're sitting there already good right\nActually no wait yeah January of two thousand twelve when we closed that crazy that's nice well one thing I did read Thomas [noise] anyways uh so you know it goes on with Chris bishop he's our current jail the president did a a demand announced the one that they did that happen I think\nTom and Tom if you're listening and you did win\nAnd he goes on with Chris bishop he's our current jail the president did a a demand announced the one that they\nDid that happen I think Tom lead time if you're listening and you did when I think he did when is it all down you need to call up and let us tell us your one less I'm you know he he finally got out of eight on a hill earlier years like the river gum with you know five to ten thousand a month and\nYou know going up we're going to hit a peak sometime later this year and we said that too I I didn't say that you use the ... you have said three hundred grand no problem I thought we would we pick up three hundred and Ninety five to Ninety five is where we're going to stay and then I was right [laughter]\nCheerful [laughter] here you are right but like all the time\nThe then vice is largely stalled over the summer after reaching two Ninety five and ... the median price for single family homes built up tonight in June right yup stayed at the same of July climbed back to two Ninety five in August like\nWe've told Iowa way data to eighty five though if you recall now I never did it did you keep saying to eighty nine but that then that they went down and went from ...\nTo eighty five to two Ninety five okay right to to eighty five they're not I but I just said I'm always right there you are I write again\nProbably not the way [laughter] that's a median home prices do I have three Fifteen by the end of the year bishop said he expects it will happen during the first quarter of two thousand Nineteen\nWhat do you think about that if they they accept right I I think his credit ... partially right I think the first quarter of next year mhm just because of history\nIs just go to kick them by January February march we're going to kick\nWe're going to do great right January said like the middle of January the faucet turns on here we go out we really get the three Fifteen\nTime a lowly tell a I think we're going to be close so we're going to definitely go over the three hundred mark\nYeah okay I I I pose a date with that\nI I guess it's an inventory I mean we're we're we add inventory why about sixty three hundred early early but if we get to by the end of the year if we get the eight thousand left that's going to make a difference here think we're going to say below three hundred thousand flip the way in writers quarter Ryan Gordon says ...\nJeremy borrows the G yeah he's\nHe runs applied analysis would that Jeremy where on Iran who was a ... an analyst they're smart guy right they don't know everything pretty much during though he says a leveling off of the home prices this summer shouldn't set off any alarms I agree with that\nDuring the last several years prices have been escalating at a pretty\nRespectable pace at a year over year basis but seasonally during the summer months they tended to flatten out of bed during the summer months southern Nevada is meeting home prices hovered around two hundred and two thousand fourteen through twenty two thousand Fifteen to thirty five and two thousand sixteen\nTo sixty last year according doesn't expect home prices to nosedive anytime soon even if they do meet or exceed the pre recession peak\nUnlike the boom days there's less speculation in the housing market setting lenders are required to have a buyer's put more skin in the game even sell real estate agents acknowledged\nThe seller's market can be frustrating experience for the first time homebuyers very one of those with a more modest budget without a doubt then there's that so if you guys want to chime in and go ahead\nI have several people right now that are on that that are on the fence about lifting their house they're doing a list that\nMhm and they're ready but\nThey you know to listen to our show the here's what's going on all I Know is if I Want to sell my house right now and I sold to a couple of

U. T. [noise]\nThank you for joining us America we're glad you're with us Chuck is on the line and ... for\nA job welcome to the ... show\nDave thanks for taking my call sure what's up [noise]\nWell my my wife of a ... of about a hundred and forty thousand dollars in the past two and a half years good for you\nBut we've only got about a hundred new things about what to do because we have our mortgage oil three rental property but we\nAre mortgages on and and the two years we've had a little graduate high school or college ...\nAbout how the today show he's taking out loans for the other half and I thought we should have been to a four one K. and if I got a beginner babies to say that I just feel like I'm not sure what to do next I I feel like I'm\nNot doing everything I could do for my family right now\nWhich ... about a hundred or so can the two of you you and him a cash flow the school and stop the studios\nIf we don't if we're not as aggressive on these little property as we look past couple of years\nOkay if you\nI guess I just needed to hear a because he's got two younger brothers that are going to be going to college to hear the next few years\nWe'll ... maybe stuff for five and six are simultaneous for is Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement five is kids college which you are cash flowing in this case\nAnd a six is payoffs mortgages how you know rentals in the house and so forth a but really um you know in your case you're going to really is you're going to lay working on six much in order to fund these colleges or in a sense you're borrowing on student loan debt to pay on your mortgage is\nWhich is stupid in an indirect way that's what's occurring you follow me\nSo I just think a lot of our consumer it that we should just save up a a a three maybe four month of march see farther than yep\nAnd then and then let's let them stop taking out student loans\nAnd clear them out and then do the same with the other two and then but if you can find cash flow above taking care of these college issues between the three kids if there's money above that then we started throwing it at your either your mortgage or your rentals one of the two but it sounds like a rentals are tiny\nThey're not you know there are about sixty Seventy thousand dollars apiece they're not huge but they're they're still there\nIn the house is trying to get there and then around your house mortgage must be small\nIt's about about fifty sixty Seventy thousand hippies\nOkay the moral fifty as you said to Fifteen yeah yeah and for what is the only one\nOnly twenty five dollars and write them a check like a year now and I was going to feel good and my son is do I take out a loan\nYeah that that's that's and that's the little rental okay Hannah there was one in there somewhere to make them out to work All right ah yeah still I'm just going to plink along on those minimums and take care of college without that first\nOnce we got college without that then we find money we throw it up to have to probably go knock out a little twenty five one out and then among ... house out 'cause it's pretty even with the other ones\n... how about ... back in the four oh one K. or not\nDo I get back in the four one K. a Fifteen Percent now now okay\nYeah well no says you get your emergency fund right yeah emergency fund is maybe step three and then maybe step for his Fifteen Percent of your income in retirement then we'll take care of college and then if we find some more money will keep while we're doing those are the two things will start throwing it at the rentals in the house\nThat's your order of attack maybe steps four five six in order actually three four five six cars you're finishing up the emergency fund in order right\nBut it's not like about four or five and six or all simultaneous Fifteen Percent were taking care of college and then if there's money left we keep going down the list and the next thing on the list is mortgages about is that so there's still a prioritization even though it simultaneous is that logical\nYeah I guess I was just trying to jump ahead before we get three or two and three I guess technically\nYou're given five or ... yeah yeah yeah and you had any skipped three to yeah [laughter] yeah\nSo yeah you're on around the way we want you back in order that's all we did you can do it's good plan man thanks for calling him a lease is with us in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania Hi Lisa how are you\nI mean it's an honor to talk to you how can I don't think for yeah okay\nWe had our house currently on the market right now we live in July for two teams [noise]\nUm I Know there is not an email in our area [noise] um [noise] we did it down to one Ninety nine nine [noise] we've had only one county we've had ... heads on line [noise]\nUm [noise] what we're struggling with\nOnly one showing we've had hundreds of heads on line [noise] um what we're struggling with here we paid one fifty for the house the average stays on the market in my area as three hundred and sixty nine good\nLord what is wrong area\nWell it sort of a weird situation it's rural um Pennsylvania we have like an elite area about Fifteen miles from us and those houses are selling for about a half million [noise]\nUm and then ... and so that that the Haitian because it's on lake we're on water on a on a street team but I'm a military than at our house is kind of out of the local market so we're waiting on a vacation or\nYou know you're not in in Harrisburg proper them\nNo no I'm In like northeast yesterday a near near New York border but\nSo is your biggest problem is you have a very limited market yes the dummy three sixty nine days on the market is unbelievably long in this current environment that we're in\nI mean and all that says as you're in a very rural setting um and it's not true resort it's sort of adjacent to resort stuff\nRight and you just have a limited market I don't know what to do your other than a\nIs there anyone in the resort area if you drive up in the area that is true resort and you're like fringe resort is or is there a a realtor up in that area that's moving a bunch of that property that you see there are signs everywhere they kinda\nSpecializes in that so that if they had a client that really didn't want a quiet pony up for that area but one of the have stepped down they knew you were there\nI mean they're they're reaching out to our relatives or they're just not not purchasing\nI'm Talking about your the real estate agent in that area is or someone who dominates that resort area\nThe higher end stuff\nI'm not really honestly I mean we kind of stepped out to our nearest town they get a kind of a ... I mean we had a professional photographer [noise] it looks gorgeous on line it's not you know these ... it's so rural it's kinda like everybody's second job [laughter]\nSo why are you moving [noise] we need to get it where we have an hour drive to work we can't can't do it anymore you know it was a kid you know\nWe're on the road for hours a day and my husband didn't know how how significant like that we just say oh well\nI don't think I don't think prices are promising a you've got a marketing problem you know what I mean by looking at\nThey're looking at it on line\nAll their workers they're not they're not clients are lurking they just like the picture flip through and they when they realize where it was they walked away there were not\nClient's location Gillum was not the house and it was not surprised\nBecause our neighbor's house I mean the closest neighbor um same set up as ours his sold for one eighty nine half the size of our house but double the lot yeah\nBut he found a buyer for us to I mean you just don't have any potential buyers much and that's what I'm trying to do is fix the marketing side of this this is a this is a really tough one I mean do I pick another well yes\nThat's what I was trying to get you to do to go up there and look at the resort area who's moving those half million dollar houses\nThat when someone going to look at that ... million dollar house in just gulp I really can't afford it but I Love this area they go oh I got this place down there in the fringe at under two hundred and it's the sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that can do that this that the people that are\nThe sweetest little house and you got to see it and that's who your sexual yourself through your realtor is the person that can do that\nThis that the people that are gathering the leads in the upper area and they can funnel I'm Down to you for the people that don't want to spend enough to be in the other area and and that's your best shot you just need more potential buyers you're not a good potential buyers\nAnd it's probably not your real first of all they probably just don't work this area and they and they don't have the potential buyers and you need it it's a very unique [noise]\nSemi rural somehow resort situation oh I'm Sorry this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\nIdentity theft has become an epidemic data breaches are being recorded every\nMan I think you know were given maybe Ninety years if we're lucky in that full eternity which is like a a glimpse in time and then within that time I'm given even less of a time to make a generational impact on my kids mhm and so for us it was\nYou know I created a list of things that brought me joy and a list of things that created a burden mhm and the houses were\nAt the bottom we're not on the list of the joy and there were at the top on the burden wow and so I was like you know this is let's keep it simple and\nSimply wasn't that way on one of those ads [laughter] I was actually not that way for a while one of my best friend's actually said don't you lie to de France ha ha ha ha or out of or it from the beginning so I mean I'm\nA ... with your all's income I can say I might have sat there and argued to keep the lake house or something you know the the\n... what's your wired it was really difficult to to give out some things that\nYou know I felt like we were doing well and everything is we we can do that mhm but it also kind of boils down to the are getting older and we have\nYou know what do we want to do with them as they get old ... and and what do we want to show than and so we had you know we kind of had to have a heart to heart as you know we needed to see what was important\nAnd they're going to see that you know well and the other things are obviously in terms of time spent somewhere where there's the beach with a lake that kind of stuff\nWith the income you've got no debt\nEven do anything you wanted to yeah I mean you can go to like in Europe if you want I mean it's you know you can do whatever you want to as as not even\nAnywhere near as expensive as those houses are so right it's um you know you are your free up such still have incredible uh family memories doing it doing recreational type stuff is what I'm trying to say yeah interesting very interesting\nSo um so a big pile of it was that what was the rest of the debt\nSo our our whole debt is um\n[noise] by paying by virtue of paying those off we're able to pay off the home that we live and mhm and so we we use the cash derived from that ... plus cash flow and some savings\nTo pay for our home that we live and okay so it was just three property ... yeah that's where I was all your real estate I mean that's all your debt whichever party is okay for the whole meal events worth what one point six wow you guys are amazing\nCongratulations well and obviously holding back then and clearing that that's a big part of the equation there yeah 'cause that's secure then amazing and absolutely\nAmazing so you're sitting there with a net worth well in excess of two million dollars now easily I'm the I'm guessing it for one case but with this income you got to be loading up so um\nHow you feel it feels great I mean I'm you know I'm I'm I'm kind of\nTo the point of a second guessing even even having so much of our network tied up in a house ... um so but it feels great you know it's it's a it's a first step and a journey\nYeah yeah well I get give yourself a couple three years to

H. kept burning oil will now I have the beach so that's my first question how did you turn the dealers or the two\nI have at least six so a lot of love I'm thinking about four cylinder review states you're concerned about that\nAnd yeah and I am I Am in a way to uh I'm In a way\nTo drive the four cylinder Silverado until now to make a final judgment on it but I I was disappointed with the fuel economy and you know to have a four cylinder and a half ton truck I I have trouble rap in my head around that first off\nBut if that's going to be the case suspected there to be\nReally good fuel economy and it just wasn't there I mean twenty ... twenty three on the highways mediocre or at best and so I I was disappointed how do you turn leadership around I Do several times and I got to be honest Robert\nThere is no tricks or gimmicks to it it's all about people it was who I hired and who the training that we put them through a lot of people that own dealerships just give sort of lip service to a couple of areas one of them is training\nAnd I was a big believer in that\nBecause I wanted him to do things my way and my wife was a proven way and it worked and I that's why I wanted him to do it uh the second thing is\nThey don't do a lot of times don't ... I'm trying to find higher and retain the best people in the industry I overpaid my people and I know that\nAnd that's okay because when when another dealership will call one of my people and say hey we're looking for somebody to fill a position or you're interested\nAnd I'm sure they always ask the question what does it pay and they they couldn't hire him away they wouldn't pay him what I was paying now if I'm going to pay that kind of money I have expectations and\nThey they couldn't hire them away they wouldn't pay him what I was paying now if I'm going to pay that kind of money I have expectations\nAnd the biggest one is you take care of the customer\nBut first off my philosophy was unless you've got happy employees you can't have happy customers and so I worked very hard to go the extra mile and do things for my people if you go back into the archives these true stories I've been writing read the one about parties\nAnd and what I did for my people every Christmas and the bonuses that I paid out\nAnd and the the the party out through for all their children on the showroom floor on Saturday and bought each one of them a personalized gift\nIf those things make the difference but it in Dallas Fort Worth when I was in the business that was twenty nine four wheelers we all had the same inventory we all had the same opportunities we all had nice buildings was breaking glass the difference was people\nAnd if you don't have the best people around you\nAre not going to be successful for very long and really that was I you know what the other thing too I think I had I think I had a um I don't I don't know that I call it a gift but I was good it advertising I Would do things different\nI hated typical ... I never did any TV ad I did all radio and when we ran specials and back then the newspaper was a big deal\nWhen re ran specials I wouldn't put a price or a vehicle in my newspaper ad unless I had at least twenty five of them some somebody comes in with a chip on the shoulder say I bet you don't have this one our reaction was what color would you like Robert thanks for the call I Do appreciate\n[noise] seems out\nAll over the place looking for the ride vehicle is the right price or you can just simply listen to the car from show the straight talk an honest answer to that everything automotive you should talk to the car pro Jerry Reynolds otherwise you might as well just use rock paper scissors to decide your next guy call now he's a good time\nHere's another one eight hundred nine to say Seventy seven Seventy cents\n[noise] we've all got places to go from work to play morning to go go go go somewhere if we go for music movies workout and check out it's quite a little schedule we've got going to we need some\nThe ... here certified quality fuel comes and it keeps your engine running cleaner better than longer\nSo you can get right back to go\nFind a station near us the letter clean guest dot com [noise]\nWe're looking for a few select dealers to be car pro USA certified car pro USA we take it very seriously the car pro USA certify dealer it's always focused on delivering a hassle free experience and a fair price\nIf you're a car dealer or no one car dealer that has the rights to be a car pro USA certify dealer bingo the car pro USA dot com and contact us that's car pro USA dot com\nAds you know there's an incredible product to protect your cars dashing staring well from the sun keeps you interior tutor and fits your windshield perfectly\nI like things that that ride at work like they should that's why I Love heat shield it's a windshield sun shade that keeps your car up to forty degrees cooler while protecting the anterior custom fit for your bagels wind chill it won't fall down my generic sun shades\nGet yours and our heat shield dot com that car pro two words all caps and the discount codes\nIt goes wind chill it won't fall down like generic sun shades get yours and I'll heat shield dot com that car pro two words all caps and the discount codes and get ten percent out that I Do heat shield dot com\nI noticed my neighbor put a broken world's best dad mugging the recycling bin ... curb so it did with anyone would do fixed it with some J.

[noise] my\nQuestion is I've got a two thousand seven care like ask lady ... lover I bought a shake your hand but it's got like two hundred and sixty thousand miles on I'll put a gesture transformation it within seven hundred miles when I when I got the vehicle\nAnd I'm getting to a point where I'm at his truck I and I don't want to get rid of it\nWhat should I expect out of how far I can probably push is staying with the transportation\nIs there a point where it's just probably better to get rid of it\nYeah the J I I kinda think you're there\nOh seven was the first year of the all new escalate and it didn't change until twenty Fifteen uh but that first year and in general General Motors products prior to twenty two men\nTend to be problematic I'll be honest with you I I'm surprised you've gotten two hundred and sixty thousand out of it usually about two hundred thousand and they'll start to nickel and dime you to death\nI'm the one thing I Would caution you about is sometimes you can go too long and then you have a catastrophic failure maybe the engine maybe transmission maybe something in the in the drive train\nA that goes out right now even with the miles because escalated so popular it's still got value but if if the engines out of it\nAll of a sudden you're valuable escalate is worth zero\nSo I wouldn't push too far I think you've been lucky to get this far given that was the first year which there are some issues that you're nothing nothing bad just a lot of little things that went wrong with escalate to new kinds of Suburbans by a light they had it all corrected\nYou don't find out what everybody finds out when they when they go when they tried to flex fuel the the eighty five is less money than regular gasoline but it also cuts your fuel economy by about thirty percent\nSo it ends up it ends up being a washout I'm the only real advantage to hear any five\nIs your vehicle will run right it really likes the eighty five as far as performance or et cetera but kills your gas mileage and so most people try it they do the math they go back to regular fuel because ... not not nearly as readily available\nRight okay ... so much they could jak anytime my friend thank you for holding Curtis lake arrowhead California Curtis welcome [noise]\nArea this\nMorning I'm doing my friend how can they help you\nUh I'm In a market for a new vehicle for my wife she currently have a two thousand six legs to start three fifty has caused a twenty two hundred and twenty thousand miles on it the family's grown up things we carry has expanded of course\nAnd I kind of swimming in the information of vehicles out there I'm torn between the ... uh and let's go to line\nThe Tahoe or even something in the ... product and I was hoping you can ah Clinton and the right direction so we need a third row seats Yes sir and storage capacity in the back okay and as she enjoyed that Lexus\nAbsolutely has been very reliable a few little injector issues here and there are but other than that it's been great ah wracking thing is starting to go out on it but uh so far so good\nThe reason I ask is because of the ride of the Lexus are acts is just so good and then you start go go into some of these trucks\nSo that there is I ask is because the ride of the Lexus are acts is just so good and then you start go go into some of these truck based SUVs instead of a crossover Lexie Scott\nAnd and there's a marked difference in the right now there are some you know the ... the suburban Yukon even they escalate those ride really well and let there be it's gonna be a lot bigger than what she's used to um so\nYou know this if you go midsize crossover the Highlander is a great SUV and it's got a good ride but you go to the fore runner and it's a it's a truck and it's it's going to bounce are all over the place\nI think I think you're probably going to be smart to get her out and do some test drives\nA on them but I Would say the Tahoe certainly\nIs a all the G all the big GM's if you go large now you could try the enclave the beer which give her more of a ride like she's used to him and it does have some room behind the third row seat not huge but as much as anything I've seen in that mid sized classification\nAnd enclaves really nice as she got a wonderful interior\nOr you look at some of the insanity products I like to Korea if if if I had to choose between Korea and the big GM SUVs I'd go with the GM SUVs Korea is a really a good good vehicle buzz dated\nAnd and the interior has never been as nice as what you get from the the Big Jim SUB so I think the big thing at this point is to get out there and do some test drives\nAnd and let her figure out what she's gonna like and I'd take it which gets down to maybe one or two I Would take an extended test drive if a dealer won't let you do it I'd even go to the expense of renting a vehicle for the weekend that she thinks she wants to buy\nAnd that's that's a pretty smart strategy without you jumping out there making a mistake\nI'm the are acts of course comes with a third row seat now in the L. model but oh it's tied back there you're you're not going to put adults they're not going to put adults specter\nAppreciate that and then also are looking at a December timeframe that still a good time to by the end of the\nYear absolutely um ... absolutely the incentives are the best of the year the manufacturers are pushing the dealers are pushing trying to make their numbers\nPeople all across the industry or tried to make bombs checks for the end of the year yeah everything kind of comes together that week between Christmas and New Years and I you know not to say that's the only great time to buy\nBut for as many years as I was in the business it was the best time to buy and there's just no mistaking that\nAnd yet it almost had to have worked in the industry to really grasp it and understand why that such a big week but it is and everything comes together even trade and values go up at the end of the year or so yeah that's that's that's a great target but but do some driving and make sure that you pick the right thing\nIt's it used to be much easier when there wasn't nearly as many SUVs to choose from\nOne eight hundred not to six Seventy seven Seventy seven that's one eight hundred nine to six Seventy seven Seventy seven and a we've got
