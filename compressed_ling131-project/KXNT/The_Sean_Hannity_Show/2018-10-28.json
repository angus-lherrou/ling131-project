world series David Allan liberties itchy genealogist and the New England his door to the logical society in American ancestors dog words how are you sir\nOffer a Red Sox nation we are doing really good and I'm going to be home for a couple of weeks before I\nHead out to Salt Lake city for doing some research with any it shifts in our tour I just got back from the British Institute and I'll tell you it was a wonderful week of twenty classes intensive on English genealogy and I hope to go next year and do Irish Scottish oil wells which are the other three components so\nSo I've been telling stories as I as a kid and I carried out on through high school that involved in a lot of journalism even get fading teams because it's verbal\nAny ... anything with or anything with writing and after that I moved into walking with youth\nAll energy verbal made me happy anything with or anything with writing and after that I\nMoved into walking with youth and so for a long time almost Twenty years I worked with youth and then also at risk and adjudicated youth and he earned the nickname from the kids the story lady which I thought was kind of funny because they knew they were never going to get a straight answer\nAnd I even use the story or used applied\nStorytelling with them and use it with great intentional purposes\nAnd after doing that I was kind of burnout emotionally and there were some obviously some politic things that bothered me and just tired and I decided to take a step back and kind of reevaluate what I wanted to do next and I realize the one thing I couldn't live without what storytelling I Love to tell stories\nAnd it just so happened that right before I made that decision I was at a dinner party in California there's a leadership syllable and\nA woman said you know she's talking I overheard will shave storytelling festival and I thought what sites use myself and went over and I said look I wasn't nice wrapping her two words storytelling festival\nSo the kids these kids I work with\nJokingly call him and his story ladies' so is this festival for kids and she said no it's in the bay area San Francisco I don't think it's an action anymore I think it's the phone\nI could be wrong though and she said about a thousand adults come and people tell stories professional story tellers and I was like I'm I was born and she asked me where I live and I told her and she\nTold me about the national stereotypes festival she's like that's the mother ship go and I did and my life was changed I can still remember\nStanding on the street with my backpack\nAnd in between tents there's about six cancer is about Fifteen hundred in each ten and I remember standing there thinking this is it\nYour own thing you're ... right\nMhm and I vowed to myself that in two years I'd be on that stage [laughter] [noise] Ah yes innocent\nAnd um [laughter] I mean everyone's like you can't you have to do this this this because we all know we live with us and I'm like can you tell me if I can only do something one way I Will\nMake short preview there's another way to secure the\nPool and a little bit easier and faster so I did I work my tail off I mean like a young group of guys in a van driving a man I Would tell anywhere for any amount of lead to anybody or worked all my craft\nAnd I wrote and I traveled and sometimes I worked for gas money sometimes I Would take tickets and tear down chairs if I could open for a certain storyteller\nAnd a lot of festival directors were surprised I was willing to do all of that\nYou you don't lose you pay ... yes you did it out and this this is what people need to understand is the story telling crafts\nReally use a craft and and I know it's very insulting to some to call these towers comedians because if it is there are similarities to stand up but it's very different from about its long form it's a lot of detail\nAnd and I love the fact that you can really take your time with it\nYeah and you know what I'm there is a big difference to my friend in the opposite\nWhere when he says the difference between comedy and what we do a humorous class storyteller and that you fall in love with other people or characters yes he fall\nSometimes they die and sometimes things don't end well but you know in my piece is and I am long form but I can I have a twenty minute pieces you know but I purposely used the funny very intentional and\nFour months can John\nYou know but I purposely used the funny very intentional and [noise] months can find\n[laughter] it is the love you get first of all you're just one of the most time when people I've I've ever seen under these stages in in what you're describing starting to be starting from the beginning you've always had that gift and there is a gifted there is talent involved\nBut what I Want to do is spend part of this segment with you and the next one is talking about how other people can develop some of these skills what it takes because I think people going to reunions and having the ability to share stories about grandma and grandpa has got to be one of the great gifts that you can share with descendants\nRight you know if they're really serious about carrying these stories on to take a little time and try and homeless skills as valuable because the younger generation the tension held and we also have to remember that just because I'm a mom and I'm a grandmother\nAnd even though I Know all the stories of my parents and grandparents just because they're falling around my head and once in a while we dropped the line or two does not mean children and grandchildren to them and I think sometimes people would sit down with their children and grandchildren and started asking only shocked at what they\nDon't know something is very basic as you know how grandma and grandpa meant yeah\nYou know and I work at all a book that are going to actually have a pool I sort of interesting ideas as wild insight as to how to make the passing on of the genealogy the stories of either genealogy to\nFuture generations how to do it in a way but it's fun and inclusive of all sorts of getting involved and I'm really excited about\nThat it's in the work and uh I Love this kind of stuff\nAs you analyze your ability to put the story together because obviously you create a lot of material not every story goes linear really ... and it works out and such a way that things come back around in it for you to understand the significance of what just happened that type of thing\nHow do you analyze the story and tied those threads that keep coming back around and make them so interesting\n[noise] [laughter] well it's a complicated story Our that that the the workshop Scott yeah [laughter]\nOkay let's take it down to the street to the basics you have\nTo have the people which obviously in genealogy only do it that's what we want to focus on right now we're not talking fiction and then there's the place so you you research ... but the bones in Oakland account King I caught the accounting of genealogy but the people the places debate\nBut it's the problems and the progress that make up stories to say\nOkay that's the\nThat makes it really goes yesterday I had a lot of the way the luxury that was more than an honor it was a luxury to present the BYU law students on afterwards we had a lunch between the professors and the people that are raised but on the conversation just with how good is talking about\nThe things I found out about our families during her genealogy\nAnd there and do a lot of interesting stories\nAnd problem and progressive and that can be local feet or what could build a great story a round the accounting part of genealogy\nSo I mean obviously the people who have the place you have the problem yet the progress and so whenever you take a certain portion of history out of a family with all that down to one unique personal if possible\nA girl or whatever you hope a certain course in the whole story out of a family with all that down to one unique personal as possible try and go to a lot\nOf research on the farm of draw what what are they eating well not really ... up a writer who really want to turn a little Toy Story and something about your family over and over the little details added to\nThe arc of the story among the people in place all the time really plus all out I'll tell you who's a real mouse or was it was a gentleman climate Romney\nUm he so good at all sure stories\nOf cooking hookers and even an ... county come out on a real period field to the story I couldn't even ... may not be any allergy records but it's common knowledge about I'm not really solid\nOn a those are all shore criminal things to do\nWell and I think a lot of really good genealogist understand creating a timeline around your ancestors not only of their dates their birth marriage desk\nAnd places but also what's going on historically within their reach in their area within the country maybe even within the world because a lot of those things really inform what happened to that person throughout the course of their life\nIt can also explain your stock pot or surprise but don't underscored\nRight boy there's so much and they were\nYes and it can bring clarity which then allows you to lay out the story like Warren concern for more understandable and focus\nI'm Talking to keep them white camp she's a storyteller with the story telling festivals throughout the country and acumen we come back I Want to get an idea of how much exaggeration you allow yourself when it comes to family stories\nAnd why when we return coming up in five minutes on extreme genes America's family history show\nDo do do do do do [noise]\n\n[noise] the all new radio jak combat is available now\nI found out exactly how you would do that I found out that they actually have patches of calcium but they would spray and I added that to the story right because historically it's correct It's the embellish meant that does not shaker towards the branches or trying to dig up words but it adds to make people leaving in\nSo when you talk about embellish from it then you're not talking about making things up what you're doing is you're adding things that were part of their lives at the time that makes them a little more human\nExactly now let it be clear if you pay me the right amount of money I Will make things up\n[laughter] and I have known\nAnd unknown for tall tales I have a talk about my uncle alarm and applying sled and I'd say a third of it is true but people know straight out by the time we get to the and this is an absolute tall tale\nSure I Would never make up a suppose it's back to stick in the story to make it better when it's about my family when it's something that's going to be passed down history and building upon the genealogy I Would not do that\nIn essence you're just talking more about the way it's told and I I I Know you mentioned to me before about how you would sometimes build up to align like your your story with your father and the relative that old I'm a little money\nYes [laughter] so what I did was to build up to that I just talked about all of my research the hours at the computer\nThe amount of time printing things out following leads that I found chasing dead ends and I just build it up to the crowd and then I take it and I'm proud and I lay it before and my mom and dad and I lay it all out the the whole thing and I gave them an accordion file with documents\nAnd I'm just waiting 'cause I Know I'm going to be the favorite child for months and I'm waiting to see what they say and my dad is studying it and studying it and studying it and he stops him points and he said that guy right there he still owes me money\n[laughter] and so it\nJust makes a great joke disagree on line now did he said at last did he say it that way no is it\n[laughter] so it\nJust makes a great joke is a grill on now did he say that lost any say it that way no is it sound like my dad absolutely did he think that was a great joke a hundred percent sure\nSo I kind of took it and I hold it\nYou know when you're a patient ... of the loving admiration for all your effort is exactly what you must have felt\nMore [laughter] exactly\nYeah I Do and it doesn't always do well at the Thanksgiving dinner table you know it's like oh no fish has another story for [laughter] show as as you go through these things you really have to make some editorial decisions don't you\nYes especially because\nStory that I tell are going to be hurt by tens of thousands of

seen this on a show the first time I've heard someone call in and say their information was sold\nOn the dark Web was sold crunch desires ... had given him a warning that they'd seen some sort of breach in that\nLarge amounts of data was being downloaded away from him a when there were not home like fifty gigs at a at a chunk wow then who's the security company that he's with\nContacted him and said that his email and possibly use password were sold on the dark Web\nWell I'm sure wasn't just as email probably right and that's all they were able to probably ... attack a he also said that

Andrew\n[laughter] that's true so you have ah so you've not had a good time or the last couple of months huh\n[noise] well it's all happened just for you in the last month when all this information came to me\nI see okay and so and so you're so the information that that they told you just what he said to Andrew is that that your router was compromised and you're a Gmail account was compromise is that what I heard\nThe slope they believe is ... and then what steps have you taken since\nEveryone said the same thing that I needed to immediately change passwords and make them complex on the route or and also the change passwords on my email and anything that my email is used for to get into and I can ... for instance a bank account if I sign up with my email\nI should change the password correct so I've done all of that\nOkay and now you're wondering what else can you do wow I Know yeah\nI'm Wondering about like is there such a thing as an ... for a home or or some sort of a bumble that you could buy the monitors things\nUh it just seems like the alternative is to put\nA different programs are apps in place like malware bites an anti virus and password manager and so forth and I'm looking for something more comprehensive and this is serious business here um this is all of our data and I'm concerned about maybe some\nA professional type of protection\nI see okay and you know what and rightfully so I mean because you know it's it's once you get your data compromises you feel so vulnerable don't you I mean it's like sure you know all this was going on and you had no idea until somebody told you said this information's been downloaded through the router\nAnd did they say that maybe are computers are being used to house any type of pirated material\nNever heard a ...\nOr a cause that's a lot of data fifty gigs in a day I mean that's huge\nAh so the best way more than once and you feel well yes that's what I was thinking that maybe uh 'cause what sometimes with\nThe the hackers do is that they find a vulnerable computer than they house files there and then they tell everybody to go access the files on your computer\nOr so that this way they're not liable you know they make it harder for them to be tracked okay to be tracked down a so I Would definitely go through and look at data usage on any type of gadget that was connected to it\nYou know with the route or like you said like you know you give it a good a password and you can also do Mac addressing have you lived in into that\nYou know get media access control or what that means is that

this beautiful house in the middle of five acres okay\nAll right it's in the house is like a thousand square feet but she likes it because there is she has no neighbors right right now she's also a doctor on call [noise] and so before so she has a house in escrow and she's totally Cosby she freaks out she's like oh\nMy God what am I going to do I don't think there's Internet and we I have this house in escrow\nSo I told her just to uh I I did some homework for her and I found a a a a gentleman who lives about a mile away from her\nWho who has a line and has set up a point to point Internet access service with some of his neighbors\nOK okay\nAnd she pays fifty dollars a month and she said she's got Netflix she's moved in she has no issues you know things like that her kids are now in college so she doesn't have to worry about you know three kids gaming she has five kids and then she was worried about that right [noise]\nBut but still she was able to get to to fight in and she has to look at you know X rays or whatever it may be just look at him in real time right mhm\nSo but she's able to do that through a point to point service so I see if there were any options in in a if you just Google your ZIP Code with point to point that's what it's called ... or sometimes it's called fixed point wireless\nAnd basically all you need you don't need any lines you need a line of sight\nOkay so if there are a lot of mountains and a lot of mountains around you know OK okay so so if they're sometimes if you have a lot of mountains that it doesn't work\nBut years ago as I I Believe it or not I live in the center of Phoenix and there were at the cable company wouldn't come down the street and I actually had to have a six point wireless lined put in on the roof\nThat I could go down to South Mountain from my house which I Know that doesn't mean luck to you but it's like twenty miles by the bird flies okay for a while so I Would look around to see if there's any type of six point wireless\nI Would also call wins dream in your area or to see if they have any options for you as well\nYou know other than that you know you don't waste your money on a booster a cause you you know these game updates could be a gig right there ...\nAnd then I started playing you know you're you're looking at even just a movie could be three gigs and uh so you know and then and then of course you're going to have to tell the kids that you know there was a time\nNot too long ago when you used to walk to school on the railroad tracks\n[laughter] and it's no with no shoes\nExactly so they're just going to have to go to the library okay we'd been there and allow gay me [laughter] we've tried hat\nI could just see you're you're you're you're you're like all of a sudden like there

I Know I wasn't\nI mean I just remember being a kid Saturday morning in common you sit in front of the other and like and I would have my bowl of cereal\nAnd the night before when the new television when it come out like right when school started in September the night before they had of the previews show and they would preview all the new commercials that were going to I mean the new cartoons that were going to happen sorry more than that was the ... what was your favorite\nUnder cats really I loved I'm Tom and Jerry from your favorite I did and and the road runner but those are all school they did but then there's also a mighty mouse heckle and Jekyll\nAnd I'm ... was was funders have okay the other thing that they don't know about is the pet rock what is it that rock okay it was his phenomena\nWhere this guy had a rock he got rocks and he put it in a box and he's told you the rock which just rock just rock like a normal rock yes nothing special episode you the rock and the guy made like two million dollars selling rocks\nSitting by a box with a rock and yes it was I'm waiting for the punch line where there was a total fat okay\nYou know as a matter of fact when I ... and I gave her and tell a story that when I was trying to syndicated show I called this guy CBS his name was Frank Murphy Hi Frank and casual listening and Frank told me that that a show about computers in the Internet would never work because it was going to be a\nFad a fad like the pet rock [laughter] and I'll never forget that 'cause he said it's like a pet ... through my iPhone is just a pet rock sitting in my pocket speaking of the phone when's the last time you used a pay phone I don't even know do they even exist anymore or I saw them in Great Britain okay summer no I I've been a long time\nSo I was standing there it's actually quite funny is I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booth were inside\nNo I I've been a long time and so I was standing there it's actually quite funny is I'm standing there like in front of the phone booth where there's a phone you know like in front of the phone booths were inside there's a pay phone and were you on your phone no and I was just stand there like being towards like Hi okay and in\nPlus out laughing and I said what are you laughing at\nOkay behind me there were all these naked women painting like on the phone booth like but their phone numbers they found a use for the phone booths exactly which is also the phone book\nBut isn't that something that's crazy yeah the phone book or the telephone operator yes the telephone technology for the longest time did not change and now we just fast forward and when when did the iPhone come out ten years ago two thousand seven\nThat was ten years prior to that it was fifty years the same old phone okay did you have an Atari twenty six hundred yeah how are we are all generations video games game boys just how to game boy I say go CD game this generation that annoy anything about that no cars on their parents' phone if they don't know anything about a road atlas\nLike a map map yeah no no that would have had good right yeah okay\nI've never I never learned how to fold up a map and I I don't think I'm gonna try now okay America\nOnline now you know I started the computer section at AOL usually yeah years and years ago do you remember when everywhere everywhere you turn around that somebody put an AOL disc the cereal box you went to store it was everywhere that was really genius marketing right there\nBecause how they did that behind the scenes\nIs that and I can I can talk about it now I'm sure I'm not under any more non disclosure agreement says that we'll find out do that [laughter] is that with AOL is that if you gave a desk\nSometimes you'd make ten dollars at that person is that is that person used your desk to sign up for AOL you just made ten bucks\nSo we always got them from another place that doesn't exist anymore and that was blockbuster video so you're telling me when we got our Fifteen hundred free hours of AOL's blockbuster was making my yes and then they would make money every single month I mean oh wow yeah it was really crazy for a while\nI mean this is like in the early nineties I was I was bank and like ten grand a month\nJust on AOL do ski yeah just how were you getting them in people's hands just stand on a corner chopping them up and people\nYou know like I spent in the science [laughter] no I was I Would put them in like because I have\nThe computer tutor videotapes oh okay I put them in the videotapes and then people would use them to sign him do one day they just said we're not doing this anymore we're not paying for this any more\n[noise] yeah you know what happened\nIs that so uh you know so I'm like I started the computers actually got this whole AOL thing going on okay and then they changed managers\nAt the top right and they actually called me up\nAnd that month I had gotten an assault numbers I'd gotten a check for twenty five grand for the month just by people using the disk you handed that it was the desk and then taken using the computer section okay and I I that I managed I mean this was my job right okay so all of a sudden\nThis guy calls me up but he says you know how like we've been paying you every month\nWell now we want you to pay us that's a bit different in a different character I said well that's not going to really work for me [laughter] thinks okay and so that was when\nUsing key word commando instead of going to AOL that I renegotiate I negotiated that it would go to commando dot\nCom that's when you watch the website but that is also when I learned a very valuable lesson is not to depend upon the company for the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like\nPun a company for the marketing of your company so that's why when Facebook came out I was so like I Am not sending anybody to Facebook because I already gotten screwed over by AOL right so why would I Do that which speaking of one last one and\nCan you make the sound of a dial up modem\n[laughter] [noise] what was that anyway [laughter] yeah one on one hand shakes like all the handshaking dollar ruin garbled\n[laughter] yes I mean it was so bad that you know sometimes we go away and and where there'd be no Internet or anything and I really like walking around making that sound like you can only do they do that intentionally\nYes they wanted it to sound like you know they wanted people to know that that was connecting because previous to that it did not make us out if you want to listen to a fascinating podcasts and then we got to go to a break a fascinating part of

know why it's called Cisco don't she went down the woman went\nDown to the business office in San Francisco she tried to register like sixty different computer names in the seventies and they were all taken\nSo she's standing there on the street and she says I'm In San Francisco she's the bridge and she says that's a gateway we're building a gateway so that's where Cisco came from San Francisco and
