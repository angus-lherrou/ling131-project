this is a good one folks do listen to that it's a good one ah for this house a was probably lived in about sixty days since it was built in two thousand eleven they purchase it at us as a second home\nThese folks are from San Diego California so when you walk in it literally fields and looks brand new and smells and in ... oh yeah it's beautiful house ... highly upgraded forty five sixty four

houses twenty nine Ninety three square feet so just shy of three thousand square feet\nJust shy of three ... square feet is five bedroom three bad there's even a room for a dirty in that house for four hundred thousand dollars\nSo that there's a house that sounds like if somebody was looking for new that there's a better option right that\nBeautiful gated community it's buffalo ranch right off of a rainbow buffalo that area or while we are so it's gated beautiful ...\nIt's beautiful gated community it's buffalo ranch right off of a rainbow buffalo that area or while we are so it's gated beautiful brand new park inside full hunted cheese\nFour hundred dollar three thousand square feet [laughter]\nAnd if every anybody wants to see the website on this I'm posting it right now on Aaron Taylor's Facebook thank you and if you buy this property and now I I Will get the cellar\nTo pay one percent of your closing coyote now there you with your mortgage through like ...\nWell for a hundred thousand means it's one hundred thousand higher than the median sales price right now you know that we went up three hundred three hundred claims last\nYeah their energy bomb I Do know that I Wonder if this is a stupid question but that median price what's the median square footage like for that three hundred yeah I don't know ... that would be an ...\nThat well I mean one of those things are destined we talked about this morning you know part of that number is new homes in there too right no no not not this number\nOn the lower ... yeah I well I guess it is this number yet because well they had they had lived up there they list there some of the homes to any number of tore yeah they've had that on their kind of drives us up to the real numbers a little smaller than this but whatever we're we're not going to get to and detailed and that\nBut we just say three hundred that's what they are Jay ... or pushes um so that's up about one point seven percent from the previous months that's Thirteen point two percent from the from the year over year\nThis time last year when we're doing the show you guys were to sixty\nFive that's that's quite an increase\nTheir man and condos in town homes and he gets on what\nThose are at bart what do you think price point yeah median sales I'm going to say two hundred\nOne Seventy little little high there still a little while to side [laughter] that's the ... so what do they are up ... back in town at one point four percent\nFrom year over year so those things are skyrocketing and the reason why is why I mean as you know people can afford\nThose were four to three hundred thousand dollar house nowadays that's worth something else that bart [laughter] five [laughter] seven well we just bought how many houses for sale that offer autumn right now we just\nWent on I'm going to I'm going to guess go on fixed the eight hundred and Seventy\nThere go close enough close enough that's about what sixty eight hundred houses yeah so this sounds like that doesn't sound like a lot\nAnd I'm going to say not including town homes and condos ... you're not going to say about just under nine thousand what town homes and Honda or there was about\nFourteen hundred town homes in college in the middle of life that I get this though does that that sounds like a lot right that's a hundred percent from last year yeah Ninety nine percent yeah so there was literally guys know supplying house condos and talent why do people selling those now they're in I mean what's your what's your story on that\nThey're just they've already ... investors aren't buying them like they used to because the cap rates aren't there I mean it's still a good deal but when you bought a counter a town house for a hundred and twenty thousand you get twelve hundred dollars a month rent a lot better than buying one for two hundred and twenty and getting fourteen hundred a month threat\nKnow it it doesn't tell me in here which is odd was the actual sales or which I did look up it was like twenty two hundred which is not good and what I was basically down Fifteen Percent from last year actually a little over that\nThat that number is concerning to me um you know sales are down right yeah pretty ... Fifteen Percent drop in the bucket and supplies going up and in fact supply I think it's gone up for this\nUber sense no drop in the bucket and supplies going up and in fact supply I think has gone up the for the last thirty thirty one week\nRight which is and we talk about that memorized talked about the percentage that we might hit would be about that Fifteen Percent yeah remember we talked about just months ago we were talking about people were talking about a bubble and this going down and that we're like no no no it's going to be an adjustment\nYeah and that's what we're seeing yeah well it is a little odd man we're ... or median prices going up yet sales are down and inventories going out and make a whole lot of sense so I'm really curious to see what the next couple of months come out because that's more and that's a better indicator of what's really happening right as you say\n... like a couple of months I I'd be pressed to say that we go down ... I Would think would too I I think I think I in fact I I think we might have a decent dropped down I\nIf I had the bat and I I like batting now we're only I only a week away from it and all that let's see I'm not good at it but I Do like to bad so what do you think the two or three team partly on this [laughter]\n... I'm ... I'm saying we are a median self rice goes down to two Ninety next month what do you think\nOh I'm going to say actually we're in it right now I Believe me I'm going to you know my father to Ninety One two Ninety One so are you ... what he was playing prices right here with us\nToday the ... id want what do you think from a three oh too thrilled to he's going up John ... is thrilled to and I say a dollar\n[laughter] that's the way I'm good one to Ninety five maybe ... probably two Ninety five so we'll see I I'm you guys are listening out there I'm overly out your employment but\nI Am again even if we drop the two Ninety I don't think that's a bad thing for our market no I think it's you know where we need to be especially this time of year yeah and I'll be really curious\nTo see what happens this time next year right that's I mean that's what we really need to figure out and that's kind of\nYou know that's where we're going to really see with the shift of our market's going right away it was the status quo do we still have the same amount of inventory or we you know now twelve thousand houses on the market well and I I Would say I and re other another point higher bar right\nYou know ... and ... are definitely going to have you always affect a sure either either a qualifying right\nWell I tell you what twelve thousand homes on the market one percent and stick it in the MLS ain't getting it sold nope telling you that right now and it comes down at a walk and more than that\nObviously it still comes down to price point right if you're under three hundred or shoot if you're under two fifty that those houses as far as I Know still selling pretty fast right I mean if you left the house and at at at where we should be priced in like let's say to eighty\nGood afternoon hey hey Kimmy\nYeah um my brother in law is wants to sell his condo probably in the next month or two they they they don't need to sell it but they do need to sell it anyway\nPoint um he speaks English

in restaurants some while he was in school for two out to eat out a lot of these out I as ... like the ... green that gave me anywhere in life about ...\nPercent why something why I didn't smell anything [laughter] All right let's get back to credit so we we at nova home loans you have a credit services division pretty sure it's only a mortgage company in the planet die off or is it and if there are some that have tried\nWe we at nova home loans you have a credit services division pretty sure it's only a mortgage company in the planet die off or is it and if there there's some that have tried to copy and failed because they don't know how to do it however if you have a\nPoor credit score we're not going to kick you to the curb we're not going to have you go to some credit company the charges thousands as air and experienced right you have to do nothing in fact we've helped you out right\nWe had a credit card or medical collection that this guy will mention his name treasury three thousand bucks\nWhich I told I told him time in ... don't do it and he has to do it you know\nI just wanted to God it was the only thing that was a blemish on my credit and you guys your gal called me up right away and we worked on it and got rid of it so easy hero\nCostumes zero so monitor your credit's regularly you know you can get a free report every month right free credit report dot com yeah there's a bunch of different federal communist or other creditors on that end up that one's free there is a certain free ones that we can\nHook you up with credit Columbus is going to try to charge you on you know up zillion all their services you know to pay for it and you know the better ... the better credit scores that you have equals the better interest rate\nI there's no mystery and yeah I mean if you have a greater credit score you're gonna get the lowest rate possible so it's very important if you're thinking about buying a house check your credit see what it is that\nAnd if it looks low then calls up let's start working on it now right I mean that's you know if you if you're living in I'm In a bind three or four months\nI'm not sure how my credit is that's OK well look let's get a pulled now so we can get you into our credit services division so we can start to get that up for a better interest rates and a lot of people they need you know down payment assistance and they don't even have the minimum credit score for that which is kind of low it's not setting the bar too high\nWell hey I'm Dustin also you know what the credit score increases even if you have a higher credit score like if you're in the uh low sevens mhm getting up into the midpoint\nMay I say that all the time I get the ... seven twenty which is a good credit jailer\nBut we get you to a seven forty right we can get you even better interest rate and lower PM I typically they go oh pay this car down to this amount and boom there you go down you know what I mean so and speaking of that is known your credit limits it's real simple guys if you have a thousand dollar credit card I bet you limit\nYou want to keep that twenty five percent or below friday the lower the actually Fifteen Percent pretty much standard that's going to give you the best credit score\nI see people not only that they hit the thousand for over a thousand right and that's a credit score killer and the biggest killer and credit is being laid on payments like Aaron used to do in his twenties right [laughter]\nThat's so funny I'll miss your payments guys here's what credit is it's a it's it's ... it's probably not security what's gonna happen\nIn the future right so if air right now he's got an eight hundred a credit score right and you miss a payment that's can't kill your credit lives it's going to go down to probably a hundred and fifty points right what a mortgage late will kill you absolutely but if you if you missed payments every single month\nThing to do so much because it knows you're gonna miss a payment right now you'll read about that [laughter]\nYou know so the people that have perfect credit you miss one payment on a JC penny cards as you forgot about it that's going to kill your credit score you guys\nSo I Know that you know people with a ton of credit cards you know keep up on them\nYou know what I'll pay the bills yeah me too my wife is of all I Know I don't want to worry about um five hundred credit scores that and I don't even need to worry about it\nKnow knowing your debt to income ratio is as important obviously you know a lot of people don't have credit cards and they think well OK why don't why why do I have no credit well you credit you need revolving credit you know people tell me a lot lot Aaron that like I just paid off my car\nOkay why don't why why do I have no credit well you credit you need revolving credit you know people tell me a lot lot there and they're like I just paid off my car that should help my credit and no actually it doesn't help your credit's installment loans like student loans and\nYou know of um car payments and you you know mortgages do help but it's they know what that payment is they know it it's just you make it on time and it keeps your credit where it is right\nBut if you have a credit card right that you've had for in the longer you've had the better and if you keep that balance low and you keep using it you have to use it to that too it's going to maximize your credit score so people that don't have credit cards\nWhat we do a lot of times John we have people come in with no credit right they just haven't used any credit is much better it's much better not a bad credit score cars will just send you up to ... uh we'll give you a link to apply for a card that we know you're going to get its third card\nIt's you're putting up your own money right you use that one time and boom you probably have a seven hundred I haven't heard\nIt was quite scenario for you and say you tell me if I adviser right I think I did um I had a friend of mine we sold their house I think it was about a month ago ... and she had a hundred and sixteen thousand equity\nAnd a hundred thousand of it she paid off her student loans okay now\nWe thought it was important to the student loan because I told her it's never going away and it doesn't go away with bankruptcy it doesn't go away I mean never do in a way there's rightly I must their private but most are yeah the student loans just does not go away\nThat hundred thousand you have in your house right now you have it right now mhm where in six months you might not have that sell your home get rid of the student\nAthlete that free I mean there are income based repayment programs that can get those payments down really low and then\nSometimes they get forgiven but it ... more often than not yeah I mean why not get rid of that I ... I mean the way I'd I've never had to learn how to do it I pulled people's credit all the time and they have these massive amount of student loans and they're just getting in their industry making forty five grand a year with a hundred and forty grand\nAnd soon or they're not in the industry that they went to school for ... and a lot worse\nRight and a lot of them were like well I don't have to make payments for a year or two we'll that doesn't matter guys when we entered his you with a pain\nWhen we're in Malta and Europe just you know like three weeks ago every single kid in Malta goes to college for free and they give him a hundred dollars a week to pay for grocery money they pay ... for their students to go to a\nTo go to college and working and every single person there gets free medical so one of the girls are on our tour\nLike I Would have voted for Bernie Sanders not out of there are there\nAny way I like Barry fill a bird maybe a lot of people as you'll listen I Want to start improve my credits which credit card should I start paying down first real simple the ones with the higher interest forty three percent exact made these tackle those get him out of the way don't ... don't rip them up right if you cancel your card that's getting rid of a trade line that you've had for a while\nAnd and you know use it sparingly go use you'll pay for gas paid off\nYou know constantly use it but tackle those high interest ones first God is my advice for you pay more than the minimum payments right that is looking to cash a refinance for people right yeah ... ... max out in their credit cards if we can turn around and pay all those off sooner home loan\nFree up seven eight hundred nine hundred dollars a month and minimum credit card payments that you can then in turn pay towards paying your house off quicker probably a good move for you just don't put those bounces back on those and I had to cut to a break so go out and play the music live within your means and set up alerts guys so\nThere you go some helpful Hansen proven your credit scores kind of important nowadays yep thanks dozens You're welcome God Bless America Aaron votes for Bernie Sanders [laughter]\nI did it or social\nThe poor now there yep thanks Dustin You're welcome God Bless America Aaron votes for Bernie saying it was just you know I did it or social is ... ...

G used jog eight forty I Am ... D\n[laughter] thanks for joining us America\nFor like five five five Andy I'm Trish in the lobby of Ramsey\nSolutions just stopped by because there were the neighborhood from Anchorage, Alaska but it's not really but things were going by guys are yeah thanks for having a ... absolutely so you guys have a question\nWe do we have a question about um insurance as it relates to a nonprofit a diversion I have about two and a half years to go there we're going to retire from our jobs and laugh in Alaska relocate to Missouri and set up a law enforcement retreat camp\nFor officers that are just need a place to go in and reconnect with their family but we're wondering is what kind of insurance should we have to protect ourselves from from potential liability\n\nCamp will be a uh the the operations of the camp will be done by the nonprofit the land that it is all ... all and we'll be rented or we currently own that property currently on that property and we'll be living on it\nThe time and um I Would suggest you keep that separate from the nonprofit let the nonprofit rent from you for a dollar or whatever and ah then you would carry law journal liability on your land\nYou need to get with insurance broker and what kind of a insurance is appropriate then\nFor a a a camp setting a liability will be the main thing I be concerned about uh that if somebody fell and hurt themselves or something like that who are they going to say well they could sue the a landlord or they could sell the tenant they could sell the the nonprofit or you either one and so\nOn a structure that real carefully on the liability side I'm probably more concerned about that and then ... if the structures on the property\nOr they they would be owned by you individually or are you in a company separate from the non profit that company would carry or that individual would carry the insurance on the structures more like homeowners insurance or if you're on the farm or something and and you keep that because I rent or can't insure 'em\nThings that they don't own you don't have an insurer more interest and I I I really would not put the land in the name of the nonprofit\nUh I'll keep it separate from a risk standpoint and you know in case something changes with the nonprofit you're not\nYou know you you're not stuck with land in a non profit that can get real sticky if you want to do so let's say you shut it down and you want to sell the land you know you got mess on your hands up and land is owned by the nonprofit you see what I'm saying yeah they keep that separates a and so treat the you know the landlord heck can only ensure the buildings\nThe business so to speak of operating the camp would be insured by the nonprofit which would include liability especially with that and any of the things that the\nUh if you're a tenet for instance in a house you can get contents insurance you ensure your stuff that's in that landlords house you see what I'm saying it's a treat these things separately in your mind that way but an insurance broker can walk you through how to do that and I'm\nI'm not an expert on camp insurance [laughter] by any stretch but insurance brokers are the type of insurance people to shop several different companies to get you the best deal\nAnd for instance a I've got a friend that owns an airplane okay and so you don't go to the state farm and get an airplane insurance okay then we'll salad I might but you wouldn't want by there even if they did so you you said you would go to an insurance broker and they shot five different companies that Ruy airplane insurance\nAnd then they come back and tell you what how that how the liability works on that and how the different you know and the if there's a crash about what happened in the same thing here they would find five different companies that ride camp insurance\nFor for families are adult camps or retreats or whatever I'm sure there's companies out there that have specific products associated insurance products associate with this and they would make a market that means an insurance where they find somebody that I write you a policy\nOr two or three and then you compare him while this company covers this thing and it costs this much and discovered company covers the same stuff except it doesn't have that one thing and it costs this much and you start to compare and decide you know what's the best type of insurance for your nonprofit and for you individually the individual part will be a lot cleaner\n'cause it's basically a insurance on a farm or or insurance on the foreign plus a few cabins you know almost like a\nThat kind of stuff so you're covering the structure that's a lot cleaner but the other stuff you just get somebody that that can you know go into that little bit of a specialized type of insurance is what I'd be looking for if I were in his shoes is but the main thing you want is liability do do hold harmless agreements or carry any weight in any of this um\nNo I ... yeah they carry weight but um\nThey eat and\nAre no agreements that keep someone from you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was rotten and one of the cabins okay\nAnd from you cannot contract away liability okay so let's say that a floor was right and then one of the cabins okay and um\nThat's a liability that your fault regardless of if they sign to hold harmless you you are liable for that or you're standing in my building\nIf you slip and fall and uh because we didn't you know properly install the floors or there was a hole in the floor and we forgot about it or something then we're liable for that regardless of if we had you sign a Harley Varmus before he walked in here\nYou know so uh you cannot contract away certain kinds of liability so you need insurance anyway and you need to keep stuff separate an ownership like we were talking about anyway those are called that's those moves or risk management moved you're you're managing your risk but a whole harmless is\nIt what that does is it it's like a lot of contracts that keeps on its people honest right it's like do you know you were you were walking across that employee fell on your face 'cause you've tripped\nYou know and you're trying to hold harmless agreement and you know then you're going to call him out just on his honor you know if he doesn't have any the insurance companies lawyers gonna call him out on his on her and the fact that he signed this and it helps them when their case they're not after writing a check but\nYou need the backup in case you were to lose that uh and it'd be proven that you are liable regardless of the whole harmless but I I I Would have um signed them in those cases for sure as you know when you register to you're going to be here for a week and it's a wilderness experience and I have an attorney draw up a little simple one page thing but\nYou know if if you're on a four wheeler\nExpedition on vacation and you go and get on people's four wheelers are on their jeeps or on their snowmobiles you know you sound these two page documents that are all found Brenda about how if you die you're not that they're not liable they're still awful\n[laughter] they'll still loose [laughter] so yeah I mean it that they may not lose as easily but they'll still lose so that does that make sense to you it doesn't say thanks for the call and you're ... you're joining U.S Open phones at AAA eight to five five at two to five you're jumping we'll talk about your life and your money\nAnd a jump in and we'll\nTalk AAA eight to five five two to five All right Lindsay is with us in Tulsa, Oklahoma Hi Lindsay how are you\nI'm Dave how are you better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] um okay I have a Christian and I'm a new American I Apologize if this is something that you've touched on a lot and so I knew that the baby step and I know that number one we have to eat out a dollar\nA emergency find mhm my question is do you ever think Jeff saving more than that\nAnd and the reason I asked my husband works and oil and gas industry and getting laid off isn't really an uncommon thing happen mhm um and I stay at home with a kid mhm gets funding and how you think we should prepare\nGenerally I Do not suggest more than that until you get better baby step three but here's what I Would do okay he's in an honest stable environment with his job is what you're saying and I agree with you\nOK but um\nThat's one level of quote worry I'm not going to raise it based on that level of Henri but what I Would do is stop the baby steps and pile up cash if we get wind that he's really going to get laid off how much notice did they usually give him if he's laid off\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years I enter never happened to act really lucky\n[noise] um [noise] I don't it's never he's only been working for three years and never happened really lucky we've never been laid on the go in and they get sent home pretty quick I mean within a couple\nOf weeks a couple of weeks to do something and he's going to work on something when he comes home if they did get laid off so\nYou know if he looks up at five of his buddies were laid off last week I Would push pause on the whole sold them want to make a little baby step thing and just pile up guys but just generally worried about it you know generally worried about is what we all ... and that's why we get out of that [noise]\nIn one\nOf the smartest things you can do is take good care of your teeth that will save you tons of money in the long run to help I recommend all my listeners check out one dental dot com it's not\nThe last can occur so yeah you need some money set aside as an emergency fund and then yeah you'd be a baby step forward and you start putting Fifteen Percent of your income away and um that would be baby step for and I do that first and a Roth IRA and then I Do it in Iraq the T S P after that\nIf they're matching I don't think they do but if they're matching on the CSP I'd go and start there with her off with a match that'd be the plan\nMichael thank you for serving your country really appreciate is going to talk to you\nMartin is with us in Los Angeles I Martin welcome to the day Ramsey show\nHi Dave how what is that\nWhile I was a one of your opinion on regards to um to whether it's just all my rental property to pay off my primary residence or in path any other dead also that I have\nA much other data got\nJust two cars um I had credit card debt but I paid pretty much about Fifteen thousand in the last I Would say three or four months\nBecause of your debt free but two cars in two houses right okay how much do you own your car's\nA fifty thousand on balls\nOr total on both total\nOkay wow and what's your household income [noise] ah one thirty okay you got a lot of car and um\nSo what do you own your primary and what do you owe on the rental\nMy primary to fix the and it's worth about five fifty\nMhm and the rental\nAnd all my my rental Ohio one fix the and it's worth about I Would say or thirty a fellow at work they be but I if I'm at a little bit less\nOkay\nSo I mean the two ways to do it is usually income to clear up the mess or use the rental to clean up the mess right\n[noise] right\nAnd so on you know if we take take and say I'm you know I'm going to start paying I'm going to live on beans and rice and till I get these cars paid off and so they're going to be paid off and well under a year\nAnd then once they're paid off a then I'm going to decide I'm going to pay all the the little house or the rental first probably go ahead and pay off the rental or might pay off the house first I don't know either one's fine but um you know you start doing more forty fifty grand a year and that\nStuff let's see here we got three four uh four twenty so you've got about five to ten you got about seven to ten years to clean up those two things after the Europe paying off your car um Oregon show the rental now and be done right\nI mean that's what I really had a question whether to to do that and and pay off most pretty much tell the rent on pay off pretty much all my dad on it but I also have in mind that for that like I have a son who's about to well I Would say in in two years it's going to go to college\nI don't have a house payment you can cash flow that right okay\nYou know debt now the only way this makes sense is if you don't borrow money anymore\nRight now my credit card check that out there next time you get right by a car you have paid cash for I'm All right you never know moral money again on anything if you do this because otherwise it doesn't make sense\nRight that's that's the planet you can to get on track\nYeah you can't sort or ride this out of debt horse it doesn't work can't shorter routed me got a ride him or not\nSo if you're gonna ride him it makes a lot of sense and I think it makes sense I Would sell the rental and pay off everything cash flow college and had saved up bought me some other rentals with cash or go along out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep\nOh long out there into the future and I think ten years from today you'll be in a better place by having done that if you stay on budget and you don't keep you know you don't spend money that you don't have to go back out there and borrow money and all that kind of stuff\nBut you got to stop it you got to break the cycle and if you've broken the cycle than yeah dumped the rental um pay off the cars would pay off the house um\nAnd it does look like you've got enough to do both I'm barely close very close but you need to be a hundred percent that free a slap build your emergency fund and then start building towards junior college fund and then once you got junior college covered a by just don't want to start in a savings account just a junior college junior soldiers do within their\nBuild it up build it up build it up build it up and work your way right through it and then um\nThen once that's done then you just start saving up and paying cash for rentals or doing other kinds of investing along the way but we're working the baby steps here are the only thing is we're just short short getting everything by the ... I Would I Love rental property but I Love being there for a more\nAnd so I don't borrow money in life is good when I don't have any payments any where life is good it's awesome\nHey thanks for the call man we're pretty sure you're joining U.S Open phones this hour as we talk about your life and your money it's a free call the phone number is triple eight eight to five\nFive two to five day what's your opinion on used car warranties I don't recommend any extended warranties ever\nUsed car warranties are especially bad they're very very expensive selfish for for your home repairs twelve percent of what you spend on those on the actually goes to the fall for repairs eighty eight percent profit\nAnd commission [noise] so you benefit almost not at all\nThey make a lot of money on that\nMoney is probably to make more money on the on the phone there was this was the day ramp [noise]\n\n\nListen up leaders if you want to be a better leader if you want us to arrive at not just survive in today's market I got some great news on November night we are live streaming our entree leadership one day\nThat's right entree leadership one day live stream is a full day leadership prevent that you can stream from anywhere you'll see me along with every day millionaires and retirement expert Chris Hogan pastor and founder of the ... version Bible lap Bobby Grunwald and founder and CEO of charity water Scott Harris and discover\nWhat these top leaders due to disrupt the market place you can download the event workbook interact with other attendees through a live feed and get all the same great content as if you were attending in person know travel required may get a day for you and your team to watch to gather\nRegistered today Dave Ramsey dot com slash advanced or text anyone indeed twenty Eighteen to\nForty four to twenty two for more information\nSergeant Alberto blast go faced an uncertain future after serving his country again you're twenty seven out what is your mom and the motor vehicle actually um two cats and a wife because ... you know where to turn I was going through a really bad taste in my life mentally and physically I was just I don't know why would you what we're ...\nWinston what are the third paralyzed veterans of America\nJob as a service officers realized veterans of America say sure these days\nOh you're what the without the paralyzed veterans Winston what are the third paralyzed veterans of America\nMy job as a service officer paralyzed veterans of America is an issue of these veterans have what they need to drive and move for their lives and we're there to says providing expertise would be a benefit assistance and\nThey know everything about benefits ... million from getting self sufficient to get him a new job has changed my life was thousands\nParalyzed veterans of America serves hundreds and thousands of wounded veterans and we're going to continue to be their partners polite\nThank you paralyze whereas when you're supporting me over there and you were at the VA Don ... message from paralyzed veterans of America [noise]\nNursing you jewels like she's like you get to somebody searches last one was like when you in the corner who are you you're not supposed to be here she's my girl sometimes\nYou need to end up in the waiting room please stay with her look she's been badly injured so if you want to do what's best for her you need to let us do our work\nThese doctors said to be able to do this all over [laughter] wait a second the drivers yes me too I Swear to prevent the dinner I I was just ...
