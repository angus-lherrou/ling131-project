into a potential run and twenty twenty four I for me\nFor me the the most likely scenario is trying to use the next five plus years to make some serious calling to make a over seven figures a year which I think she can easily make\nA couple of million dollars a year a bomb on a number of fronts whether it's on speaking tours or whether it's you know some position a board seats or some position

mean he went in and\nDon't think he came out I mean that's like crazy story and you know the fact that the Saudis are in Istanbul and in a turkey at this Saudi conflict that they made this guy disappear\nAnd even reports that they they might have just remembered him and took him out in pieces I mean this crazy stuff like a lot of ground to cover your aunts that your phone calls of course a

President Trump is speaking\nAh he's outside of the White House and uh I I guess we can listen to a little bit of the president this was just a moment to go\nOther ones that are just before and then some people do they do good happen but you know get anywhere from I Would say one or do\nThe more traditional so we'll see I don't\nKnow I'm very happy the way it is right now\nI was what a great man and I think it'd be great just on the board but you know\nYesterday we agreed on what what is an honor is that there had been residence many residents and never had a choice and here I Am not even ... years and we have to do and they are confirmed in the run of the\nLeast John\nYou don't mean to the White House he's been that the rest of the guy you know I'm your v loves what we're doing for\nWrestle the other members of the Security Council to get them on board with President Trump's demand for three separate rounds of sanctions against North Korea last year\n[noise] and those sanctions were the centerpiece of Trump's maximum pressure campaign now without the sanctions folks I don't think there would have been uh any progress at all\nOn at least even the talks of denuclearization with Kim Jong alone now bottom line here as I remain ultimately very skeptical of the the North Koreans incomes ongoing they rope a dope dubs they they brought us in circles for decades here\nWhether it's Kim Jong Eun his father prior to that and the ... the Clinton Administration you know through the Bush administration so I I I don't give up much\nUh ultimate hope here but I just I I think to the north Koreans going to have a very tough time the nuclear rise the end of the president discussed that earlier today\nBut you know hey hey a little less talk a little more action please we're just not seeing any real significant action out of the north Koreans and must essentially has been out of there and play well they've done the same thing\nThey talk they'll talk about talking Oh yes what's that talks about having talks and they drag stuff out they make promises commitments\nAnd they don't follow through so the question is if there is someone that can change this it is you know Trump who can be somewhat ironic as well and\nIf anyone can change this trajectory with North Korea I think it is President Trump\nBut again I'm not bamboozled a swindled by the north Korean\nWe just haven't seen any concrete action and the president needs to push harder on that\nYou know but with you know North Korea you know Trump delivered the rhetoric and you had Nikki Haley who essentially delivered the sanctions Nikki Haley did the heavy lifting\nAnd this country owes her a great debt of gratitude there's no doubt about it and the resignation\nOf Nikki Haley this morning it seems to come out of nowhere you know catching everyone by surprise him including apparently even secretary of state Mike Pompeo and national security adviser John Bolton but [noise] you know as I mentioned last hour you know one of the\nPossible scenarios in rumblings is is that uh they're more hard liners and they actually\nSort of pushed a from Nikki Haley's departure\nBut the story that Nikki Haley is saying that he that she actually told Trump over plans to leave a six months ago and leaving at the end of this year and certainly if that's what happened then the timeline is certainly\nOn track here\nUh you know most of them is highly unusual for secretary of state to be unaware of or you know the intention of the U.S ambassador to the United nations but\nAgain this is a different kind of a White House [laughter] we see different stuff all the time\nYou know she didn't have any personal reasons you know you know wondering if it's you know the monetary issue she wants to make some money I you know ... we'll see we'll see what Nikki Haley ends up doing will go back to the ... lines coming up back\nIn ...

politically motivated looney tunes to make all kinds of threats\nAnd she made comments she did an interview with Breitbart and she she says that she sleeps with a loaded gun because of the threats coming from the other side\nAre in the Breitbart interview Kelly Paul said we've updated all of our security systems at home I sleep with a loaded gun by my bed\nI Am home a lot of loan yes 'cause your husband's in Washington DC\nSo I've got deadbolt all around the house so that if someone's in my house when I go to bed on debt bolted in three different levels it's bizarre I've never been like

update here [laughter]\nDo you believe this so Taylor Swift has broken her political silence and all the old adage is if you're a lot of the a lot of folks in show business yeah you know show your cards because she could end off and you could end up alienating a certain percentage of your fan base that was cameras swift\nAnd I said on yesterday's program you know with Taylor Swift coming out and endorsing Democrats in Tennessee\nI in the mid term elections I and I I asked the question wait a minute I mean how many ... fans are actually of voting age you know you know most of most of the camera Swiss fans are what like eleven twelve years old right Thirteen Years old tops\n[laughter] I mean when when you're dealing when you're dealing with with lyrics\nOf songs as juvenile as let's say they're\n[noise] never\nEver ever ever ever getting back to get there so many of her fans vote during the fall I think you're probably you know ten years away from voting legally or maybe six or seven or eight years or what\nA anyway the reason why I bring this up as we we have a Taylor Swift update and the claim here\nIs that more than sixty five thousand people have registered to vote\nAround the country in a twenty four hour period after Taylor Swift dipped into into the political scene and backing tendencies democratic candidate for the U.S that this is according to the website vote dot org\nSo ... how old are you able to quantify that Taylor Swift was the catalyst for there's either I I I Am a I\nHave a I have a tough time I believe yesterday was the deadline and a lot of states actually registered to vote for the midterm elections coming up in November I was I don't know if you're qualified miss so Taylor\nSwift has a hundred and twelve million followers on
