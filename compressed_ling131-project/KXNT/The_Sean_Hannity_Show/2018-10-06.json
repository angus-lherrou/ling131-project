reflect the opinions of kicks and tea or intercom communication\nHi I'm Michael Kastner and this isn't wakeup Las Vegas to show that I normally do are not going to be talking about politics or any of the craziness going on in our political world right now but we are going to be talking about something that affects all of us and that is our health care\nNow this is the season right you've got pumpkin spice law to have you got to worry about the relatives coming into town\nAnd we all have to worry about making sure that we make the right decisions for healthcare especially folks\nWho are having to deal with their Medicare annual election period\nI Can't do this all by myself I needed approach to help me out with all the facts and figures I don't want to lead you're wrong to joining us is Mary Granger human or broker relations manager for Nevada thanks for joining us thank you for having me\nFirst of all let's start off a above and talking about the Medicare annual election period what's the time period that we're dealing with\nThank you for asking every year between October fifteenth and December seventh Medicare beneficiaries not just seniors you can have Medicare if you are disabled are invited to explore their health care options before they're locked in for another year\nAnd that's the whole key this this is the key 'cause we all know about it whether you do a Medicare or whether you you do regular healthcare it's that you and I were talking before he went on the air and it's when you get locked in to a program it can be so frustrating\nAnd and honestly I think one of the problems that I run into when I'm doing my regular health care and I think people go through this with Medicare as well\n[noise] the time gets\nYou know smaller and smaller and all of a sudden the deadlines there and you're having to make a decision and you haven't done your homework on this issue or that issue and you are stuck and you you can't pull out for for an entire year so this is really one of the big things that we're trying to do to make sure that everybody makes the right decision\nI agree you don't want to make a rash decision although Medicare does have a few\nOn an action periods that might allow you to change your mind for the most part you're locked in for a year so all plants had been posted it Medicare dot Gov throughout the country and anybody on a Medicare plan or considering the Medicare plan in the near future\nAre encouraged to at least go to that site if not one of their favorite carriers like humanity\nAnd explore what the plant are and what they have now and make sure they had everything buttoned up come December seventh which is the last day to make an election for January one\nOkay so Wednesday October tenth one day only six AM to six PM what's taking place\nWe're going to have a Medicare cue and they tell us on we're going to offer state licensed insurance agents who are extremely well versed in\nHow humans human humans this is a virtual ... people into\nPerson among people that will answer your questions without any pressure just to make sure that year in the right place at the right time\nI Would want to tilt it would be very wise to know a lawyer before you ever got put in jail and I think the same thing applies to insurance you want to make sure you have the right insurance package emotion God Forbid something catastrophic hits you or your find yourself in an emergency situation\nI can ... you know count\nThe number of times I've heard friends and family as well\nYou never know when something is going to happen when you wind up at the hospital it's\nToo late at that point you need to have all of this is why they call it insurance you need really it's a safety net to to just in case\nYou you want to make sure that nothing happens you try and take care of yourself get plenty of exercise and eat right and all that stuff but your body has its own mind what is going to do\nAnd you need to make sure that you do have that that kind of safety net like a circus performer or that you really have the feeling of to me it's it's just the feeling of tranquility that you know you've done the very best you don't have to be sweating it\nAbsolutely if we have\nThe luxury of time to plan a surgery or a minor procedure rarely does anything go wrong as far as insurance because the ice had been shot AT T's have been crossed and yes that hospital or provider is in my network and they will be paid but it's the emergencies that you need to prepare for well in advance\nAnd life is full of emergencies every day's an emergency or so for a Wednesday October tenth we have for one day only six AM to six PM we want you to call in the right down this number and don't worry if you don't have a pen right now or you're driving and and you need to pull over you have to do this when you get home 'cause I'm going to be repeating it all throughout the show\nIt's seven oh two seven six six nine one three four seven oh two seven six six nine one\nThree four and if you don't have a chance to write it down all you have to do this is even easier is go to our a K accent T. dot radio dot com website and just click on the Medicare help line a graphic that you see there there's a doctor\nAnd it was and we have all the information that you're going to be needing they're one of the the biggest problems that I have from you know what I'm doing my health care and I think a lot of folks shows way\nI'm sticking with that story I Believe I'm not alone a but especially some of our ah our seniors that are going in in in signing up for a for Medicare\nIt can be confusing and and sometimes it's in language that you don't understand or sometimes you're seeing as being like hold it if I Do this plan to do I have to do this and is this connected to that that's my big problem is when you click one button it cuts out another so\nThat is very getting there is is half the battle we're talking with Mary Granger she is Humanae broker relations manager for Nevada talking about the Medicare and you'll election period and for one day one day only Wednesday October tenth\nFrom six AM to six PM or you're going to be able to call in and get all of your Medicare and a questions answered and there's no question that's do stupid trust me\nI'm the guy who usually ask them the number that you want to call them in seven oh two seven six six nine one three four seven oh two seven six six nine one two three four don't forget Medicare's and you'll election period is October fifteenth\nThrough December seventh this will be taking place both for that period starts this will be on October tenth\nThe whole point of this really is to make sure that you have the information you have the tools you are armed you are filled with knowledge you know more than the website\nBy the time you go in and you start making sure that you've got all of the coverage that you need one of the little things that you had mentioned we were talking about before sees the convenience care cost in coverage\nIs I went to the doctor this past year we go in quite a bit this one of those years we all have them we're just like okay what broke now ah and that is if you have a situation that a doctor is looking at and you're going to come back in three days or a week or two weeks\nMentally I've decided this I've already done my co pay\nWill know you're going back again and there's more and there's more and there's more you have to factor that in it's not like one one copay fits all\nCorrect and most co pays for office visit not for initial treatment in diagnosis yeah so you want to pay attention what is my maximum financial liability this calendar year should something happen and die and in and out of these\nOffices or complex diagnostic services or hospitals\nWhat are some of the questions that people should be asking if it if it's not on your you know starting off your list just to get going what are some of the basics that people should be wanting the answers to when they're making their Medicare annual election\nThey should be asking do I have full Medicare and by that I mean Medicare and be do I have a drug plan and it doesn't meet my needs this year should I explore for next year\nAnd by the way to 'cause this'll be me and I still do this when I hear that\nMaybe you know the answer you don't if you don't know the answer the question no such thing as a stupid question what's the difference between a and B why do I need both isn't there see the covers all I mean you can ask anything they know the answer to\nExactly and a license agents that are receiving the calls are bilingual English and Spanish so they can fields lots of calls from lots of folks\nAnd when I was saying by the way they speak in plain English I mean we're playing Spanish they just seeking speak in plain language that you understand in it and it isn't over your head and here's the key to this is always really important and I'm Glad that these folks are doing this is that if you don't understand\nIf they see something that you don't get tell them\nJust stop and say I'm Sorry this just doesn't make sense to me it's okay they interested in is not the first time they've heard of before I Would do it I Would do it too because what you want to make sure as when you call these folks seven oh two seven six six nine one three four on October ... six am six PM\nThat you are armed you are feeling confident you're feeling sassy for change you finally know what is going on ahead of time so you don't have to worry\nAbout this any more this is something I've gone through two when I've been doing my healthcare\nIs that you think you've done a really great job and then the year takes place and then you get those big surprises if you educate yourself ahead of time you don't have to worry or sink or threat like is this going to be covered you're probably going to know more than the receptionist\nI agree and I like to look at insurance in a worst case scenario so I Know what I'm On the hook\nFor one time it's okay to be worst case scenario was definitely half empty yes just\nTo make sure you have those proverbial ducks in a row um and there are several ways Medicare beneficiaries not just seniors can get Medicare the federal Medicare program is a beautiful program again it works from San Diego to Rhode Island in this eighty twenty fashion\nBut another way to get it are through these Medicare Advantage plans that were introduced in Nineteen eighty five and had been running a strong sense\nMedicare Advantage plans if when you hire a company like Humanae and they assign co pays to all of those Medicare benefits you would get when you flashier red white and blue card mhm but they reduce your financial obligations or\nUm level of expense God Forbid there was something catastrophic that happened and then they put in a whole bunch of extra I'd like to call it the advantage and Medicare Advantage\nTransportation services dental allowances for vision and eye glasses Medicare will ensure your eyeballs but they think I glasses are a luxury they'll oh by the\nWay that is true because I run into it with my aunt before they do and and just like why would this not recover\nExactly science and commercial plants I think that's a huge assumption people entering Medicare think well it was covered on my employer plan so naturally it will be there and naturally is not right Medicare plans are different than commercial plants and you're going to want to ask those questions when you opt in\nJust in case it's not part of the plan maybe you're going to need exploring different insurance or additional insurance besides this but Medicare Advantage plans will give you exactly what Medicare does an ad quite a few additional benefits\nOftentimes for no monthly premium other than the cost of your anti intimate care\nAlright again we're talking with me a merry Granger shoes Humanae broker relations manager for Nevada talking about this about that is going to be taking place\nHelp line of going to take place before this is important before the Medicare and you'll election period so\nWhen you go in and you start making your decisions of between October fifteenth and December seventh you are so well armed it's taking place five days before the election period starts it's going to be Wednesday October tenth\nFrom six AM to six PM one day only and you can call and get literally anything answered that you need at seven oh two seven six six nine one two three four\nLet's talk about how people can learn is it going up to this this event taking place how they can kind of arm themselves a little bit more what other ways can they get more information what websites\nThank you so nationally Medicare dot Gov a ... it's Medicare time dot com and every state in our United States has what's called a ship program yellow pages white pages you can\nFind the way this morning on my on my porch your Medicare book uh no my my wife pages I hadn't seen what I was looking at it is in there\nIt is in there it is in there and then every Medicare beneficiary today should be receiving if not already a Medicare and new handbook you can also find them at the libraries and the Social Security office\nAll right let's recap some of the things that that we have been talking about in case folks have been missing this or they wanted a ... to sometimes I knew things were repeated\nActually every day I mean things are repeated to be quite honest with you who is eligible for Medicare is there going in to this period maybe they haven't signed up before maybe they just need a a a reminder\nIf anybody has any doubts about their Medicare eligibility they should call Social Security but most people who are us citizens or have worked in the United states for at least ten years\nThey may qualify for Medicare and anybody who has Medicare part a and B may explore one of these Medicare Advantage plans come October Fifteen\nRight and then also we\nKnow most of us when we're doing our health care and I think this the supplies most of the time there's some out and they're here and there you're stuck with your decision for a year typically yes [laughter] yeah\nAnd so what were the really the point of what we're trying to tell you is don't be stuck be confident it's sort of like you know I'm Elton John's come to town right and I know I Want to see on John So I Am going to make this decision on the click that box I'm going to get out my M. X. card I'm going to buy those tickets\n'cause I Know when I Need these tickets it's exactly what I Want to see so you want to make sure that when you go and you make that decision and you click that box that this is the exact decision that you want to me oh John won't help you with your Medicare though but I'm just telling you that that's how really sure you want to be when you go in and you make your elections\nCorrect and unlike Elton John tickets we won't sell out yes but it's important\nTo make them well I mean you know medicine can be expensive but still Elton can be a little bit more\nCorrect you just want to make sure you have a decision in motion by December seventh\nAll right so I'm against some of the initial things that you want to keep in mind when you are looking at your a Medicare coverage some of the most important things again you\n\nNa\nHa\n\nUh\nUh\n\n\nUm\n\n\n\n\n\nThomas Watson seniors served for many years as the c._e._o. of IBM and built the company into an international success\nStory is told the during a business meeting in Nineteen eleven Watson became frustrated by the lack of good ideas being generated\nThe trouble with every one of us is that we don't think enough he declared knowledge is the result of thought and thought he was the keynote of success in this business\nOr any business today the word think adorn the walls of IBM buildings everywhere and remains at the heart of the company's identity\nNo one would dispute the value of good thinking but sometimes we're so busy doing that we don't take time to stop\nAnd think and learn in our eagerness to get things done we may worry that whenever we aren't busy acting or acting busy we're wasting time but in reality our work is most effective when it's it\nAnd that takes time\nPausing to think and learn\nCan be time well spent it's how we progress and improve as one professor road we live and work today you know learning economy we can't just be knowledge workers\nWe must also be learning workers and learning requires recharging and reflection not constant action life never stopped teaching so we must never stop learning wise lifelong learners\nSeek not to impress others but to help others they find joy in expanding their awareness and understanding of a broad range of subjects they're curious and courageous in the pursuit of knowledge\n\nOr\nOr\nYeah she is\nThe ...\n\nFrom the justice heart known all along studios\nIt makes the H.

sure was hot [laughter] that's my [noise]\nMy my question is is my dad is Seventy five years old\nSteel works He works in a steel plant makes about four fifty to six fifty\nA week\nAbout couple of years ago he got sick I found out that he had to pay he's\nBehind on a lot of itself had a somehow got fifty thousand dollar loan\nFrom the bank\nAnd he doesn't have them attention he gets about Fifteen hundred and some security and I'm I'm just wondering what what what can I Do at this stage for him\nUm I did provide him so I took over all the bills and I did provide him with about five hundred dollars a week on like a debit card that for him to buy food\nAnd what are you doing with the rest of the gas [laughter] I'm Sorry what are you doing with the rest of the money\nOh I'm paying on and on paying on his cell he still has about um Fifteen K lessen the equity loan ... two thousand on a credit card mhm\nEight thousand on a car and eight thousand on the house\nAnd it was how much are you able to put on the couch I'm putting everything was the turning out to do everything on on that much money does that amount to what is it\nA month [noise] mhm\nI think it amounts to about four thousand a month\nAnd that's pretty good okay so he's got Fifteen and eight and two did I get that right\nIf you will have on the car eight on the house and she won a credit card\nOkay and do you know if you divide that about four thousand a month I think you're done and the year\nOkay and your first goal would be to get him debt free you're done with a dead an ear right rankles get him to free 'cause he's Seventy five years old and he's still working at a steel plant them understand their right yes that was going to come a moment and it'll come suddenly that he just can't do that\nBut I'm afraid of you know my prayer is at least that he gets through this year\nMhm and that way your debt free and if he's a hundred percent that free house and everything you can probably make it on the Social Security if he had to write okay not yeah not ideal not what we want but we can probably get there\nAnd uh then the next step is if we get past that that'd be wonderful let's get debt free then let's build an emergency found a three to six months of expenses but we get past that then let's start buildings\nIt could be paid off and twenty forty three and knowing that he went to live that long\nWell two reasons one is they're stupid\nAnd the second reason is counting on the house I've got a lien against the house right now that care\nAnd so the house will be sold upon his death and they would get their money or they can foreclose on it upon his death and they'll get their money they've got the collateral as part of it on and so that's part of the equation the other part of the equation is you know asking a bank or if you should borrow money is like asking a dog if it's hungry\nI mean they'll they'll loan anybody to breathe or not breathing money you know what I'm saying\nThe lending has gotten completely out of control and stupid so there's nothing you know just because someone offers you alone does not mean that you are capable of paying the loan it just means you might be breathing\nAnd ... inside of the industry is just stupid is what it amounts to but uh so we have to protect ourselves from them offering us things because sometimes we will go oh they wouldn't have offered me this credit card if I couldn't afford it and it was like no they would've offered a dog that credit card\nSo I mean and dead people get credit card offers so it you know it doesn't mean anything doesn't even mean it doesn't mean you're not a dog and it doesn't mean you're alive\nIf you've got a credit card offer you could be a dead dog and get a credit card off or it can happen so I mean you could be that low on the deal so that that's what you got to think through and just you've got to take care of him and you are you're doing a really good job congratulations Tim is with us in Dayton, Ohio I Tim how are you\nOn the umpires have I got to require retirement OK\nI'm here about a year ... and um I have a pension and don't have a while we pay off for a good way mhm I click here at fifty two it'd be better to file for Social Security and weight while before it touches on gay or take away the first\nTime in the eighth or\nYou can run the math out [noise] but usually your rate of return on your four one K. on the mutual fund that money is growing at a faster rate than your Social Security check will grow if you delay it\nAnd that's the way you're comparing it to say no words if you wait from sixty three sixty five to start receiving it\nWill you know what is the rate of return on that you know how much more do you get as a result and usually you get more than a mutual fund generally speaking um and then the other question comes up you know even if I don't need it should I take it\nUm and I you know if you're willing to live on less than you make in in a sense invest some or all of it um by not taking after four O. one K. or by some other things than than usually comes out better to take it earlier uh but but you know there's a lot of different\nParts to that equation and you know if you know when you're going to die sure makes it easier to do the equation\nOh that would definitely have [laughter] [laughter] yeah so you gotta you gotta kinda gas and you've got to say you know average death age of a male and the U.S is Seventy six averaged ... deaf age of a female in the U.S is Seventy eight\nBut once you've lived to be sixty it's higher than that because that and those numbers include infant mortality include teenage death that kind of a thing and so you know if you're healthy sixty year old you got real shot at Ninety\nAccording to the stat tables right now and so um that that's what you've got to walk through and think through in the process so good question man thank you for joining U.S Open phones AAA
