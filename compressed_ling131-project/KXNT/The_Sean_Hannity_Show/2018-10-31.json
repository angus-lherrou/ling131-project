[noise]\n[noise] [noise]\n... [noise]\nThe story on thoughts that I was just setting up before the break I Want to continue with your ... your truly is remarkable how the spots on social media are driving a lot of the discussion and adding up\nOf the discourse in this country which is turn poison isn't and vitriolic\nAnd we've known this but I don't know if everyone has a grasp on how dense and how it is really permeated\nOur environment than an and how we received news and what we talk about and what is your smack it us in the face social media folks is broken there's no doubt about it you know I use Twitter and and ... a big culprit here I mean I like to when\nI Try to stay out of the ... I I Try not to get into the back and forth nastiness you know the thing is on Twitter everyone knows who I Am I use my real name I mean here I Am but the amount of people that use a fake names or\nOr just screen names that aren't you know no way to detect dirt track these people down\nOr those tend to be some of the individuals with the nastiest a demeanor is on social media but social media is is broke into the country or around the world I mean it certainly is corrosive he just turned crazily divisive obviously\nIt has turned into the the ... the the the petri dish of every\nIn streams sites although they can't police at all\nObviously so I've got this wired piece here and I've got a bunch of notes on the story and essentially it says you know social media has been absolutely ... common dear to buy box and I'm Talking about Facebook I'm I'm Talking about Twitter year\nI'm again I'm not even talking about the extreme of sites that we've learned about the this gap site which is popular with white supremacist some anti Semite and radical groups for instance you know ... racists\nTwitter Twitter has become a major major culprit here especially\nIn the handling of major news events oh I'll give you an example on the caravan last week the caravan migrant caravan which is headed toward the United states dominated the national news on TV on radio in when\nSocial media [noise]\nBut do you actually know how much of an impact for instance Twitter made with the propagation of that story hold on net\n[noise]\nSeconds on me forty AM accent\nThe this is a court ordered notice current and former forward Lincoln and mercury owners are less ... skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal settlement related to allegedly defective to counter airbags and their vehicles\nTo see if your vehicle is included and to file a claim to auto airbags settlement dot com or cold one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com or one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six\nAnd you have so many people that clean and are so into social media whether it is Facebook or Twitter or other social media sites that it's another tool that can be used to drive us apart and I'm telling you\nThey're trying to rip us apart from within and when I say they I'm I'm Talking about foreign governments like Russia and China there's no doubt about it you know even if you largely agree with the way the president is handling\nThe migrant caravan situation though the fifty two hundred troops there's no sense of the border for support for instance\nA\nYou still should be very concerned about the use of these box which had been exposed a previously but I just don't know if people had an idea on the extent and of course the election interference and this is all part of that\nThat program of the Russians and the Chinese and the Chinese\nChinese or involving the really the ferry is ban activity\nThe Russians have gotten a lot of attention with the election interference but trust me the Chinese are are interfering as much as the Russians and maybe even more and then I'll be laughing behind the scenes of the Russians are getting more of the attention here\nWhat you should be very concerned with social media ... in this case sixty percent\nOf the conversation regarding the migrant caravans on Twitter driven by bots\nYou know manipulating facts manipulating the stories taking sides are turning up the heat on opinion and victory all and venom and just some of the the more a toxic type post for instance\nNo even over the weekend when the caravan took a backseat to what happened in Pittsburgh\nThe coverage you know the the Pittsburgh tragedy with the the anti Semitic attacks at the tree of life synagogue box was still responsible according to this piece for forty percent\nOf the caravan conversation on Twitter almost half and\nHow this can steer the conversation in this country is truly amazing\nNow a little more detail here this is all according to the statue of the facts are according to an assessment by a company called Rob a hat labs\nNow this is a start up that was founded by a couple a UC Berkeley students and it builds these tools to detect these bots\nOn line so they develop this tool\nIt's a an extension called bought\nChecked me\nTwitter accounts are most likely box and not real people and it's the bulk\nThat's driving so ... if you get\nA tweet or somebody responds to is it real or is it a bought that this program is supposed to be able to tell you whether it's real or now they're going to launch a new tool lets you see how much bought activity there is across an entire topic or a hash tag for instance\nA new tool that does that is called fact checked me she got box checked me you've got to fact check me and I found that in terms of discussion about mass uh uh the mass shooting situation at the synagogue and squirrels hill in Pittsburgh\nIt found that the discussion regarding that twenty three percent of that originated from bots on Twitter\nAnd remember Twitter had made this big portion they big announcement that they were cracking down on all this bought activity well\nDoes it look like they really got their hands on there's you know you got a whole bunch of accounts that were the leader I think ... the leader of millions of accounts on Twitter with where identified as as spam or bots I Know that I dropped\nI dropped about I think four thousand I have the exact math and I tweeted it out but I I lost about four thousand followers which I guess Twitter deemed to be a bought activity and those those just disappeared\nSo am trying to replace some of the real people so if you're a real person the police followed me on Twitter at Todd Schmidt I Am ... I Am not a botched\nSo with Twitter they ban users from posting these identical tweets to these multiple accounts a at once or then re tweeting and liking or you know and mass\nFrom different accounts and it's all you know computer program an algorithm that does this and they're trying to figure it out but clearly if you got sixty percent of the caravan discussion being originated by bots they've got a long way to go here\nYou know the box having disappeared the box of just more and it doesn't seem like Twitter is able to keep up with this so instead of you know justifying\nThe ... or ... instead of you know Twitter I\nTalk about what we've purge deal I think they continue to do so uh it's now they're kind of quiet and I I don't think they want to talk about all of the box that they have been purged which I think is a is a huge issue\nSo instead of sending automated tweets the Twitter might delete now you have bonds which just spray it and they amplify this politically and divisive\nContent you know written by actual human being so it's it's finding some of the nastiest comments or most divisive comments and the ... seizing those and then re tweeting so they're finding ways to evolve to stay a couple of steps ahead of Twitter\nSo do you know if you're being sucked yeah that's the big part of why I'm Talking about this if if your triggered or if if your incensed when you climb around social media\nAre you being played the\nFact is we are being played by foreign governments on a pretty big dams scale here\nAnd\nYou got to be aware of that that's that's the danger here\nPretty big dams scale here and you got to be aware of that that's that's the danger here\nYou know the box or getting smart they're identifying these waves and key issues and their Guam and on their grabbing them and they're feeding the different sites and they're causing again this this toxicity that is occurring in this country\nWhere we're being you know shredded were being torn apart\nSo we already have some deep divisions and now you've got countries like Russia or China or those that are operating these spots\nThey are from the social media standpoint they're they're deepening the problem there deepening the divisions you know by providing each side with with Jack Benny mission to attack with\nWere being manipulated were being used were being\nWere being conned on a very large level\nAnd again I Know a lot of this is true because as soon my executive producer will get phone calls from people that are repeating a lot of this activity they're seeing on social

I remember reading about this maybe a year ago that their program is late it's the latest over budget and technologically\nEven with the tech may stole their still behind and the plane as far as tech is is like ten or Fifteen Years out of the let me something I find that story I thought it was a fascinating story a Chinese\nChinese commercial\nJet a out dated a virtual jet ouch dated tech\nIs it a try to remember the name it's like a C one hundred years there's also that uh that can they bombed a body ate a plane was I think Airbus has taken over as well\nA ... ...\nYeah I don't know if I'm a real find the story this quickly but uh oh here it is the ... it's the scene nine Nineteen I found I read years from May of twenty Seventeen a reality check on China's seen nine one nine jetliner\nUh let me click on the story I think this is the one I read some some time ago and how they ripped off all kinds of tech over the years but still\nIt's a it it it's ... will delayed and it's like a regional jets maybe a little smaller China's first commercial ...\nIt it it's ... well delayed and it's like a regional jets maybe a little smaller China's first commercial jets that the uh let's see uh uh uh I think they maybe it is a hair this scene nine one nine certification ah\nAh I think it's supposed to compete with the the three twenty seven thirty seven\nThis jet but the stories that I read is that still technologically this plane's going on a hard time getting off the ground that you know as far as the commercials success because the Boeing jets and the Airbus jets in the in the space there trying to compete aren't much more technologically advanced and more fuel efficient so\nBut the the Chinese are trying to better that and how do they do that do they do it themselves no\nThey were bought off that's one thing do some more arrests it's like every week now you're hearing about the Chinese stealing intellectual property that Trump has talked about it [noise]\nUh what can we do about I Wish we do something about it it's just unbelievable we spend\nOr other countries and other companies they spend just in in order in about a money for product development researchers are Indian and the Chinese are ripping them off\nSo a couple of things are on the lightning round here on ... and the final minutes of the program here on a Wednesday on Halloween Wednesday\nIt's a it's been recognized for a while I was talking about this on numerous occasions not every time it pops up and I thought this was interesting Kelly and Conway who is a an advisor to President Trump\nAnd a sports person and frequently does news interviews a lot of the morning and the cable news interviews\nIn defense of the president her husband is very outspoken against President Trump on numerous levels and that's why it's fascinating to watch Kellyanne Conway\nKnowing that whatever she said her husband back in the home is saying what the hell are you talking about you lie that's not true or\nThe latest now\nIs George Conway the husband he's a lawyer\nAnd very plugged in governmentally\nOn George Conway is now attacking the President Trump a story that rolls out yesterday about that executive order to end birthright citizenship\nEnjoy he's calling it unconstitutional Georgetown ways not only commenting he wrote an op ed [laughter]\nSo once again completely opposite and saying that Trump's a idea of using an executive order to end birthright citizenship is unconstitutional\nAnd he wrote about this he coauthored a Washington Post op ed along with a former acting us solicitor general\nAnd they're saying that an executive order ending birthright citizenship would be challenging clearly lose and again let me be clear my position here\nI I don't like birthright citizenship for illegal I just think it's unfair and I understand what the fourteenth amendment says I don't think it's going to change anytime soon I don't think there's going to be a constitutional convention\nA Trump if he is a issues and executive order is absolutely going to be struck down by the multiple levels of federal courts a federal court federal appeals court it'll go to the Supreme Court it's going to lose their and I even think the victims to some of the conservative justices and maybe even some of the ...\nFederal court and federal appeals court it'll go to the Supreme Court it's going to lose their and I even think the victims of some of the conservative justices and maybe even some of the justices that Trump appointed might a rule against Trump\nAgain I don't like in the fourteenth amendment I don't like the fact that an illegal can bust into this country give birth to a kid while here after they broke the law coming in and that kid is automatically a citizen ... I've got a problem with that\nOr does it mean that the fourteenth amendment is going to change it does I don't think it will but still I have the right to believe that that's not fair and it's not right so George Conway", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "31"}
