it was the folks I I've lived in Florida since Nineteen Ninety two I bet stickers on some cars I'm not really a sticker person but you know some stickers a faded some stickers have have done fairly\nWell but the caller essentially emulating what a bunch of ah my my Twitter\nFollowers or people that have responded to me on Twitter are saying and I think that this smells that the stickers or in too good of a condition that in the Florida sun or the the stickers look just to know and they would be faded\nI've received at least a dozen maybe more of those types of responses on my Twitter feed\nWe just took a phone call it a moment ago from the color on land though and\nI even though it appears that we're dealing with a nut job Trump supporter and yes you are not\nJobs on both sides of the aisle I'm not going to run away from the fact that yeah the guy apparently supports Trump and the guys mentally deranged you got plenty of mentally deranged people support Democrats\nI'm not playing this game I'm I'm trying to deal with facts at this point but people are suggesting that the van that oh this is totally a democratic set up so it is now gone from\nYesterday what everyone thought that the suspect is going to turn out to be a Democrat\nOr propped up by democratic operatives to make it seem like it's a conservative or Republican or a Trump supporter that's trying to blow up these Democrats with the mail bombs with the pipe bumps\nSo now the ... apparently it's a Trump supporter now we're hearing that on other than the than the stickers they just look too good now this

claiming that my husband's picture of the magna bombers van for November first twenty Seventeen was fake news flashes not 'cause I don't think it is\nAnd I also don't like you know the fact that this

Bernie for that\nIt marks and I said back to that for for God's sake Bernie wasn't singling out Steve ... burning what to say hey the Republicans are scum they're bad people there like so therefore with Donald Trump is saying that so he has more of it I'm not saying that he made the bomb and send it to the people that know but he has some\nCulpability in this yet because oh wait what he said to people and people who are what's the word people who are not totally all their ... their president say\nHey these are bad people these are people these are enemies of the folks there you know it's so therefore but Bernie Sanders that do that so save that argument about oh how Bernie Sanders said just as much to blame does that make sense\nWell fill\nThe only individual responsible for these actions is this a saves are say he's the one and decided to create these packages apparently\nAnd mail them to the Democrats now right that since I rent a truck prompted not make these Trump didn't

to make these bombs\nI Can't say that I don't think there was no proof whatsoever that even with some of Trump's over the top rhetoric that he or in a sense spoke\nTo this bomber and told him to make these bombs you can't make that\nThey make that Clinton was the whole nine hole and sales fell ill Lenny Lenny on the answer you can't make that leap it couldn't be that this individual was just

the Democratic side and they weren't very noxious and\nAnd rough on Kavanaugh and\nIn the entire process all of the other and all of the other Democrats you know maybe he identifies with ... it could be he just decided to go after prominent Democrats or individuals that have been very outspoken against Trump\nThere's nothing to suggest that Trump technically inspired him to make these devices and

him who cultivated this relationship who built up the back\nStory and had him at several Trump rallies and building up this social media footprint of him attacking Democrats him and George Soros and and and then the mailing of the construction of the mailing of these pipe bumped who\nDo you think who\nGave them the information or or who was his his guide who led to him who led this horse to water who do you think it was\nIt could have been anybody the person who gave him the addresses of these Democrats there's no way he could have gone to the editor says Democrats without help these are not\nPublic ... what do we ...\nWe had to get help for for for those address it how what level that's that's not for you\nThey are not public ... oil is that we had to\nGet help for for the for those address it\nThey had to help what level that's that's not to go on line ... ... ... regal regal recall it it is very common place you can go online you can find out the chapel claw neighborhood where the Clintons live\nThe Obama residents will be oh this is no it's not secret the what these addresses are CNN Columbus Circle in New York come on uh the offices of a ... you know what the waters and and Joe Biden's I mean come on I ... I read all that and that's it's silly\nIt's silly that suggested in Washington DC but not ... we don't\nKnow I Know the the address is ... they're all available that it's no it's not a secret what their addresses are regal and then also under he lives on ... hang on a minute or so to give ... regal hang on not always sometimes things are in trust and the aliases but a lot of\nPeople know where Obama's houses in DC people know where George Soros says houses\nPeople know where we were Biden's place or you know is if this is not secrets squirrels stuff that you can find with a couple of Mormons on Google that's number one so let's say that he was given all this information and Democrats gave him\nA all of the the information let me assume for a bit of the conspiracy theory which I think is out there\nAnd wrong let me assume it's accurate for a moment you're telling me that once he was arrested in Boston that he's not going to a during interrogation by the FBI he's not going to give the information and then turn over\nUh the information on these so called democratic operatives that that built them up as a pet CNN brought him down you or you think he's so good of a Patsy he's going to go to prison for fifty eight years potentially and he's going to keep quiet and not say a word\nYou might not have the mental capacity to be able to understand what's going on 'cause it's quite clear that issues he might not have the mental capacity to be able to absorb all that information and to be able to be able to divulge that information\nA radio you're scaring me do you scared me that you actually believe what you're saying here I just don't against the case I think we're dealing with an individual looking function fairly well that happens to be out of his mind I think he made these bombs he probably found a recipe a lot more is going to come out they're going to find his digital background I don't know if you knew this but uh\nAnd thanks for the call regardless I disagree I mean you're looking for like not job Alex Jones or Sandy Hook a you know in Newtown, Connecticut school shooting I'd never happened conspiracy nuts stuff\nAnd you're trying to apply that type of mentality to this case it's nothing more than I think a nut job\nWho dislike or dislikes the Democrats than it is pro Trump\nThat's it that's it it's simple I just\nDo crazy conspiratorial backstory here\nKevin is in decades City Florida Kevin you're next on ... hello\nHey sir how are you doing fine go ahead okay under my course and that I have not heard a is how can a convicted\nFelon be or come from Florida Republican according to the Washington Examiner that are run today on the Internet um seven of the twenty sixteen he was a registered Republican\nIf I wasn't a steak and I think that in November we're going to be amendment for we're going to be voting on to restore writes the felons to fill in the hour I'm curious how did he\nGet a oh how was he had been registered it just goes\nThe store rights to felons to fill in the hour I'm curious how did he\nGet a oh how was he than registered this guy's had two decades' worth of crimes from I Do the grand theft drugs bombs id fraud a false tax returns and it just seems like a real work of art\n... either so this guy is just a menace and he has a long history Kevin I've seen reporting today that he never served any time\nFor any of the crimes that he was a arrested and charged with\nThat uh as far as the threat let me try to find is as far as the threat he made to blow up Florida power light in Miami back in twenty two when uh they threatened to shut his power off for non payment\nLet me try to find that he didn't do any time for that there was a a ... at least I I have that here somewhere um\nFind this story is apparently a a there's a case where a judge for instance um [noise] there was an incident a\nSex most serious criminal history includes a Nineteen Ninety four incident which his grandmother viola accused\nHim of domestic violence she sold her restraining order a but a judge them drop charges two weeks later because for reasons that we don't know so and then I read earlier that he didn't do any time\nSo I don't know if he was actually convicted so can you find out if he was technically convicted of any full lonely is activity\nWhich yeah what what we're trying to find this this this is a little loose of right now but it could be that he escaped actual felony charges which would preclude him Kevin from registering to vote\nAnd as far as I can tell it looked like I made me for free felonies and it looked like conviction was there but again I mean this is all just unfolding and\nYou know in his interpreter for and against preliminary\nBut it it's just kind of what that amendment coming up but it ... my question I guess for the Washington Examiner said that the next ... data base is the one that confirms his relation and its status as registered Republican\n... next I think I think ... next to him I think it's an acid reflux drugs are you talking about Lexis nexis\nSorry sorry neck for yeah yeah like Lexis nexis yeah yeah [laughter] I think next you know have they\nGo well and I I also I also take a drug for acid reflux as well hey Kevin thanks for your call or listen there's a lot of unanswered questions at this point and I really appreciate your check me an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine and a nationwide number here on Schmidt\nEight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine a couple of other audio bites that I wanted to play here um I have a ... once said this is a Christopher Wray the FBI Director from the presser earlier today\nAs he already\nHas confirms we have arrested sees are say in connection with this investigation as our investigation is still ongoing I may not be able to answer questions about his background or about his motive\nWhen I can say that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest importance\nTheir motive when I can say that this was a nationwide investigation of enormous scope of the greatest importance our investigation ranged from New York\nTo Delaware to Marilyn the district of Columbia to Florida to California\nAnd as it always does the FBI responded with every resource we've got including our joint terrorism task forces are counterterrorism division in our world renowned experts at the FBI lab in Quantico\nFun and I I really can't underscored there's enough we did not act alone as you can see from the agencies and departments representative here today a
