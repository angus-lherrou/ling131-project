West performed and got up\nAnd ran around the desk and grabbed a hold of our president I thought that was extremely\nExtremely dangerous\n[noise] let me tell you what I thought now as far as those are kind of was fully vetted he was through security\nAh yeah I I wouldn't expect the fact that he got up and it might be disrespectful but to get up and hug depressed I think the secret service because I was going to pounds as if the president were was grieving people uh you know at some event than someone jumps over the barrier to hug the president yeah the secret service will pounce then\nI wouldn't expect them to do that to Kanye West or at all\nBut uh you know as far as language as far as ah the content I mean that was like a a an I agree\nWith time you're going in a million different directions and showing the entire world his security code on his iPhone to show the president a hybrid I mean it ... it was like\nA a scatter brained display like I've never seen with just I don't know how many dozens of topics that he tried to to race through but it was pure insanity but I wouldn't expect the secret service to to to necessarily jumping pounds Bob\nSir I should say that having been involved in that business I Would have taken away any pencil\nAnd [laughter] anything however\nBecause in this arena that we're in right now\nPeople being dissident being disrespectful\nI feel that that was on the secret service I really do believe that they they\nLet their guard down for an instant and ... they should do that when\nYou say you're in the business where you were you in law enforcement work or where are you part of a\nU.S Agency what would you do\n\nSure all I can say is I did protect those that we value\nOur so I'm going to assume that you might have been a secret service or Capitol police of some sort or FBI or ... let me leave you at this bar I just\nFeel that he got a little bit close\nOkay All right fine let me leave you with this let me tell you what kind of us was doing yesterday I don't know if anyone\nI don't know if anyone's pointed this out but I certainly will for me my interpretation of Kenya yes west yesterday was first of all kinds of West has always been an egomaniac a megalomaniac and ours is just of a massive proportions\nI it's always been about Kanye and Tanya only and I I'm pretty sure like a dog he was marking his territory\nKanye was here slamming on their desk jumping around and hugging the president he was letting everyone know that time you pay was actually running that meeting and not Trump which is a rarity Bob thanks for the call let's grab Donovan in Houston, Texas Donovan Iran Schmidt hike\nIn ... when I really appreciate you taking my call 'em not do agree with you on most things or do respect your consistency on

Sorry\nI I I Do believe the Tonya west or and I hope he's being treated I Do believe that he does have\nAnd I felt this way for years and years that he does have some type of a mental issues\nNot not

of respect that you know where you're coming from on that but I just think that there was the message that he would actually saying that we're not talking about were just talking about you know the disrespect that happened in the office which I respect you know the reverse of the of the oval office but I Do believe that we're just not looking at the the actual content of what was being\nThat might not Donovan did you listen to me yesterday by any chance your son\nOK so yesterday I pointed out a couple of things that I agreed with Tanya I ...

and when we get back I Want to dive into this incredible story there are reports\nNow that the Turkish [noise] that they have audio and video proof of murder [noise] all the Saudi journalist folks do

like this is unacceptable violates every international norm it can't be condone the way we deal with Saudi Arabia will be a message to others\nBoth Republicans and Democrats have written a letter\nSome in Congress they want the arms deals stop there are calls for sanctions and a halt to about a hundred ten billion dollars in arms sales some are calling for the cutting off of relations with Saudi Arabia\nI let's let's dive in just a little bit deeper here\nBecause I apparently there's evidence here and now with alleged audio video proof\nAnd this gets pretty gruesome\nThe reports are that the\n[noise] the Turkish have the audio and video of him going in being interrogated him being beaten and then him being killed and there have been some reports that he was caught up inside the embassy\nThat he was actually dismembered with an electric saw\nAnd then taken out taken out in pieces and there's even\nA report that they use that I mentioned this yesterday we heard about the saw yesterday there was a report yesterday that they use the bones saw and now new today is that the Saudis might have actually employed or brought in a forensic\nSpecialist to this member of the guy and take them apart I mean folks this is I mean this is pulp fiction event me this crazy stuff here that he was killed he goes in to get a centrally a marriage license his fiance is outside and she's panicking\nOctober second they thought they were going to get away with this\n[noise] so a head of that we have our American intel uh claims and we we saw this earlier the weekend maybe Tuesday or Wednesday or stories were coming out that us intel\nApparently intercepted communications from Saudi officials and they were plotting to actually lord ... back to Saudi Arabia\nThat's I guess what the mission early wanted to do because\nOf his very outspoken efforts against the Saudi kingdom and as I mentioned the Saudi crown prince this Mohammed bin some months\nSo [noise]\n[noise] we know they wanted to take him to get them out of a a turkey or detained them in Saudi Arabia that was the very least that they wanted to do so I it's not known at least not the U.S when\nThe communique was actually intercept it but it's believed that it was some time last month sometime in September and this is when you show these columns started to well ramp up and amp up and be very critical of\nThe Saudi kingdom and its its rumors\nOr and incidentally he never called for any regime change but he was very critical of the Saudi royal family and uh the crown prince et cetera now the condemnation folks as far and wide on this\nBusiness circles a political circles here are both Democrats and Republicans in our our governments are very concerned about this the condemnation is getting louder and louder\nUh there's this uh this Saudi summit coming up and I see a lot of the news organizations have cancel plans to cover it a ... this economic summit a minute you and the secretary the treasury Mnuchin is still going the last that we heard here\nAnd a President Trump's in a pretty tough spot this is again a bizarre situation\nYou know you can have governments are murdering people well I guess a Vladimir putting does it all the time\nWhich is something else which we probably should deal with her trying to kill and poison people around the globe that's a you know Vladimir Putin's deal\nBut I mean this is a very very complicated issue you know also\nRemember turkey and I've got a lot of issues with turkey or to God and his government the clamping down the uh the the freedom is being taken away a more of the the the radical Islamic ah thinking has come with Oregon you have that coup attempt\nA and well we we know what happened there\nOur relations with or to God have been a pretty strained you know we just have this big story earlier today as well with the the preacher\nWho has been released now\nA who was accused of being part of a plot to overthrow a the Turkish government and Oregon\nSo that was a Brunson so he's out and I although if he's not in Germany he'll be in Germany shortly or to undergo a some physical checkups et cetera before he's brought back to the United states so you know we've had our issues and problems with turkey and turkey a\nNATO member a NATO ally has increasingly over the last couple of years they seem to be drifting away from western principles and being what a member of the nation\nShould be about and more towards a radical a physician so ... is our relationship with turkey getting but anyway this is a very complicated matter Saudi Arabia folks is the main cog\nIn our foreign policy in the middle East that I've said this many times Saudi Arabia is an absolute power check on Iran\nAnd also the Syria as well now Saudi Arabia\nIs one of the main components will even call it the secret source as far as Jared Kushner's Middle East peace process is concerned than what he's developed in what Jerry ... trying to push so to say that this is very sensitive that's a clear understatement\nBecause Jared Kushner or a Jew by the way has cultivated a very deep friendship with the crown prince with Mohammed bin some up\nAnd he and the family I mean they're now implicated in this disappearance that torture the beating the interrogation the murder the the bones saw cutting this member meant of\n...\nA U.S permanent resident and then we have the arms deal here\nAnd we know that this came up at the White House yesterday and the president has actually said no we're looking into this we're investigating got people on the ground but this is not going to interrupt the arms deal this a hundred and ten billion dollars are going to\nA U.S companies to us a an arms manufacturers so Lawson is the number a hundred percent accurate as really a hundred and ten billion dollars ... who knows I mean that's a that's a lot of money anyway slice it's certainly the Saudis want to buy a whole lot of crap at a whole lot of course there's no doubt about it\nA and\nSaudi Arabia they do leave the list as far as us weapons exports now the president\nIs\nWell in a tough climb right now and uh there's many in our government both sides of the aisle who are isolating the president for him continuing to stand with the salaries on this I certainly think the Trump is being a little bit more\nAmbivalent are cautious than it needs to be now I'm not saying that the arms deal leads to be canceled\nI you know what\nWhat Trump is saying here is that he's trying to save the arms deal because he doesn't want to see a U.S jobs evaporate I don't think that our foreign policy\nShould ever be tied to jobs because that gives the other side in age\nAnd given in she'll take a mile and then other countries are witnessing what's going on as well and that's not a good\nPosition to be it you know the arguments what should occur here is to essentially make this a twofold situation\nIf you know the bottom line is if the Saudis if they don't get the arms from us then they're going to make deals with the Chinese they gonna make deals with a lot of reporting in\nRussia so it's going to give\nThe Russians and the Chinese it's going to give them more of a foothold in\nThe region so that's you know obviously a problem as well so let's say there's not a a cut and dry matter I mean there's a very\nComplicated situation\nTell the arms to the Saudis\nAnd then they need to come back to us over time for service and parts and tech support\nYour cold the answer to four to five minutes so I mean we do have some leverage you know over the Saudis in that fashion so I don't think he cancels sale I think you leave the sale in place but listen\nOr anywhere\nHey Sean Spicer and every mid term elections since the

ready to talk to the Saudi king how the hell is this thing that I go All right eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine I have a president ... don't be a girly man on this you got to stand up I'm not saying cancel the arms deal\nBecause there are also huge geopolitical steaks here with uh the Saudis at a check on Iran but the Saudis are not totally clean folks they don't have clean hands\nI don't trust the Saudis ah you know what it is what's good for them as though it's good for them whether it's good for them this way that you you understand that\nAh otherwise uh they go the other direction and again I still have lots of questions on nine eleven and who knew what inside a certain levels of the Saudi royal family so President Trump don't be\nA girly man here in in dealing with the Saudis\nBut the whose side is from going to take ... is this going to be fascinating to watch here hey uh back to the hurricane back to Michael and again my thoughts are with all of those in the panhandle in Georgia and the Carolinas and Virginia as this storm is wreak havoc ... obviously\nThe images the buildings are raised the apocalyptic atomic bomb light damage\nIs just heartbreaking and again\nOf any idea what the death toll is we've got people that are unaccounted for folks that apparently we're going to write out the storm in the panhandle in Mexico beach area who have not been accounted for\nWho knows you know ... ... where this thing's going to end up uh so again my thoughts as I see all these new images as as new drone images new drone footage an aerial helicopter shots come in a it's just unbelievable the amount of debris\nYou know the stories of of people saying uh this is my house this wall blow it outlook of this couch or look at look at this furniture over here this isn't even mind you're having people that have furniture in their house that came from somewhere else\nAnd deposited in the remnants of of their house that's just unbelievable you know Jim can't tore of the weather channel there was a report that he was almost in tailed by debris and\nI've said this before you know oh it's this this requisite shocked\nThat they all the the weather folks to the news people that you know standing outside uh as long as they can you know bracing against the wind\nAnd water and rain bidding against their face and microphones drenched and they all want to get that shot I guess it's ... it's a hunger and it's an expectation\n\nThat ah the viewing audience has that we got to see you know I'm Jim Kent tore or our wrote gr or whoever from Fox or CNN getting tossed around by the by the weather Jim can't touring the report is that he was almost impales by debris\nAnd I've always said that at some point one of these reporters is going to get killed\n[noise] I hate to say it but at some point it's going to happen\nAnd Jim can't tore from the weather channel\nWho was the subject to that story where the Santa Rosa county sheriff's office they actually put out a trespass warning I had no warning or reward die you know the press pass warning Jim Kent tore don't show up here\nAnd of course it was tongue in cheek because they were saying hey Jim Kent toy don't come here because we know that you go where you predict and project\nThe weather is going to be\nThe worst\nAnd the the report was that Kim tore was almost taken out by a metal debris flying his way\nOn on Wednesday by the way the the we have the video on the ship list if you want to see the video we have it up and she didn't show dot com that's S.
