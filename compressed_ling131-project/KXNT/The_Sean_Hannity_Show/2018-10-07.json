citing American ancestors dot org how's it going David\n... things and being founded looking good especially far Red Sox\nYes they are aren't they think it's going to be a fun season for the playoffs in ... where do we start with our family he store news today my friend\nWell I get a real quick when you know I had a console today with my cousin and didn't know it was my cousin till after the consul but our fourth great grandfather in fact ... lived in\nIn each other and two hundred years I chose one time we took her cells go my first\nStory for a family is runners is in godson again Germany or a roofer working on a ... century cathedral found on message in a bottle and not on the beach but in a roof the ironic twist to this fish is it was a note with by his grandfather eighty years ago\nYeah for for ... passed away decades ago but he was able to eat from the kids sit lanes on his mom's side and it was a great reunion they all have their social anxiety to varying degrees of very extreme panic attacks so on but when they that they could set it up for comfortable as just like a natural thing that had going on\nOr it got each other yeah absolutely so you've been educating yourself and now you're educating others\nAnd there is a term for that as we mentioned earlier it's search angel and there are many people getting into the cc more certainly has a huge group that are involved in helping other people and mentoring them as blamed bet and juries and I know you have an association with Blaine\nTell us a little about how you go about mentoring people as search angels\nWell I found out that it just mostly learning as you go you have to have a knack for it for one thing and you'll find out if you are not much you try to do the detective work and do the trees\nBut other than that you have to learn from the best in the in the world that's how you could do that on line through Facebook groups such as the ... the fact that it was our three planes genetic reality check the Facebook group just by reading\nAnd eight people do script when somebody calls that you would never sleep if you read them all but you have to kind of the limit yourself to the most current thinks they're coming in and\nAnd you'll learn who at the top posters that really are doing groundbreaking tools that will help you to learn to work and do it faster so that is how either and I said I started going to conferences to buy for duty in San Diego with cc\nAnd that's Institute for genetic genealogy and so once I was there again you find\nOut people who have been doing it a lot longer than I have how they go about this and and what works and what does it\nWell let's go through that process you you mentioned that you saw just listen listen opportunities basically to help people is it that there's one person and that goes in and works with the individual who posted their to their case or might several people being they're working on it\nIt could be several people for for my part I don't usually I'm getting up too much with helping people who were on the boards just because I have so many people here locally and people that are actually related to need by DNA that is going to need help\nAnd so I had a backlog eye I saw dozens of cases but there are also other ones that are in various stages waiting for you that has to come in or target testing people to to solve the puzzle so I don't have time really to offer too much to help in the group I Will answer questions but to specifically help somebody that's not my area that makes sense\nYeah you're you're talking about working with people you know or a big deal to me I referred to locally I get that but you know the nice thing about this is a is it does mean there's opportunity for anybody to serve somebody else from anywhere you know from a little mountain in Kentucky to somewhere in Russia doesn't make it not half as a hostile\nI collaborate with that and other states and I never met them in person but we trust each other's work and we know how to work together\nDo you assign but there are there are people with special to use that you lack or vice versa where where you have that collaboration ongoing\nYes um when I was helping somebody who had Hawaiian heritage and Filipino heritage I found out about a dog in the in that part of the islands that I had no idea how extreme it was\nAnd so someone said you need to talk to a cloudy had oh karate okay and so that you find out who the special if there is in that area and find out more about it you know the next step same thing with the court could use a source of islands I had an adoptee who father's line came from that from the violence\nAnd so I'm Catherine was instrumental in helping me figure that out because that first specialties Portuguese aids or violence and honestly when I went to her class at the first ... G in San Diego a couple of years ago\nI thought this has nothing to do with me I don't know exactly why I'm here and then it was it that a couple of months later that I met this adoptee who needed that specific health and so I was able to know who to reach out to\nIsn't that interesting and that's really true I I think a lot of people look to many of us who've been doing this for a long long time as the doors of all things in the world [laughter]\nAnd the reality is that nobody can know everything about genealogy whether it's you know when you compare New York city records say to record somewhere in Montana or to some place in in the Netherlands I mean they're very different\nAnd you have to have people who know the territory and the same really applies in genetics as well and ... has got to be a real problem for those who aren't familiar with the term it means basically\nYou share many of these same ancestors among your family in other words maybe your father and your mother are second or third cousins going back not jak are a lot of\nCousins and your ends up getting married in it are married and yeah so everybody's kind of interconnected more than you would expect\nYeah and that makes a problem because then as you try\nIt might be to somebody else you might have a little too much energy and have to kind of short all that out how do you go about some of those tasks of sorting out in dog too many cases would kill\nFor starting them out but you look at the shared matches and try to make categories and a lot of it I can do in in my head I don't know if you see more and said that she goes out to eat these white ports to and different spreadsheets and sometimes with the charts and things like that\nThere are other new tools like the leads color cluster method so it's partly just being able to have that are ... outlining must go with this line even though there is a dog and he you know you see a connection between the two family right in the right generation\nAnd then partly just doing the groundwork a lot of these kids take time if you don't have a super close match like a first cousin or an aunt or uncle or grandparents you know there's not much work to do on a case like that but if if you have like a second or third forthcoming matches your closest match\nThen it can take some times a week for days weeks months and work it just depends on the cave\nSure they're not always quickly fault\nRight exactly and it's really very similar process to what they're doing with some of the criminal cases right now mhm in her mind your taste is involved with adoptees or is it just people trying to break through their minds\nAlmost all adoptees and maybe about half and half with misinterpreted parentage people who grew up thinking their father or the grandfather was one person that never they do their DNA results they have them access to those lines yeah and find out that their biological I this is in a different mind and that can be devastating as you can imagine because\nPeople are very tied into their heritage part of the in the search angel is learning how to have that connection to be able to be part social worker and help people feel better if they find someone was a criminal and then their line a close relative or something\nYou have to just let them know that doesn't define their heritage\nHey we're all God oh my downfall gotta McHale [laughter] yeah right so when you get into this as you as you progress with this what are you finding is the most fulfilling for you\nWhen the case is solved and you're able to walk somebody through their tree a little bit and show them what has been found time and time again they just still so relieved just to have that closure just to know the first chapter of their life even if they don't want contact her desire contact or the or the other parties don't desire contact\nIt's not always about contact and about reunions\nAnd so just to see photos of people that you biologically descend from is very fulfilling to most people\nYeah so if somebody wanted to become a search angel how would you recommend they get the proper training not only in the process but Eunice counseling side of it that often comes with it\nI Would start on those two Facebook pages either DNA detective and or genetic genealogy kits and techniques and just read up on some of the polls and spend at least some time every day on them and see what's being discussed\nBecause that doesn't cost anybody at all and you can see that something you really want to\nGo into conferences takes time and investment of money that the important if you can't do it but I think that there are other ways when I started there was no blueprint like here's how you'd be a search angel you know right and so what I'm doing now with smokers search angel training and working on writing a book for search angels\nIs to try to fill that gap for people that are starting out and realizing they have a passion for this\nCan have someplace to go and do what the next steps are just to try to say get tied up possibly making some mistakes along the way short as we did hear occasionally it's or changes he'll have a hypothesis that it might not be the right one to start with that you have to get to where you are a certain that you have the the tree correct so that you're not spread didn't need that information\nYeah that's a huge responsibility you're absolutely\nPossibility you know we do this is not here but you also have to have safeguards and be able to follow them practices\nSure absolutely she's ... from Tempe, Arizona ... thanks so much for sharing all your information about it I think it's going to be useful to a lot of people look up\nAnd coming up next I'm going to talk to a guy I got to know at the F G s conference in Indiana in August\nHis name is Rick void and he is one of the co founders for a company called ... ... it's a software that is going to make fixing your pictures

was correct correct and if he doesn't give them seven thousand dollar they are going to send everyone in his contact list\nThe movie he was watching in a video of him were watching that movie\nJust nasty now he says he's not too worried because the time that he had that password the computer you had had no camera so unless they were outside filming and they're not going to happen\nAnd to know what the heck is useful okay see now this is this is really common is this more common than you might think because I've noticed that as I've been going through my you know I read every emails from

[laughter] okay and you are still using that passed for that that if I were with you I Would just like you know slap you right across the face for doing that because you need to stop using a password okay\nNow what ... what's happening in is that these are hackers are getting hold a username and password and then they are crafting these emails and in a classic sex extortion scam or you don't want to pay them they really won't go much further than this\nThey may send you another email but don't feel beholden to actually give them any type of bit coins or just for safety I Would go ahead and

a hold on everything okay\nSo in order for you to penetrate through the operating system is that you have to go through multiple levels of encryption you can jail break and I wonder if you want him to\nAnd basically take all the security and the trolls and ripped away but if you are trying to get a piece of malware onto an Iowa device\nThat it is more difficult than say Android or window so yes that is true\n[noise] okay [noise] well what I did do [noise] sorry on this trip\nWas caught a little bit of a full [laughter] do [laughter] it's a it's a VPN but I wondered if that was enough or if

period\nTry to do that depending upon what lockdown can be in a particular community and a particular country and so I'm a lot of VPN where if you look at their coverage maps\nAnd then you want to make sure that they have multiple access points within one particular city\nAnd so that this way you can get out if you want it to ... you know it's it's a it's a really interesting topic because in

stealing anything that they can but that's a whole another topic when you are ... traveling in countries like Russia and you do come back you know the general rule is that number one before you go is

may have your device confiscated\nAnd if it is confiscated weather here or abroad uh three or six months you might be able to see it again but quite possibly a year okay and nobody wants that to
