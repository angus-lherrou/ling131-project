people are just watch ... and the news conference\nHold on while I'm at a time not only answer let me just interject you're caught me first of all when Farrah Khan made the comment the anti termite anti Semite when he delivered that horrific rhetoric\nRight there the coverage was not very heavy I saw it on a new more sites I saw it on a couple of mainstream sites but it really didn't get the kind of play that\nIt should have gotten and I'm gonna I'm gonna throw it out there these athletes if a a Jew or Christian had said something similar about Muslims I think that that would have gotten more play in the media so a hundred percent agree Tom\nThat story was it was buried but it really wasn't covered the way that it should have been covered Louis Farrakhan is a disgusting anti Semitic luggage will\nAnd I have talked about Louis Farrakhan and my uh disregard\nFor anything that he's involved with ah the fact that I had to his number and many Americans have had his number we talked about him or as conditions of warranted and stories have come up a we've talked about Sarah count on the show less than I was disgusted I pointed out it was what the the Aretha Franklin fuel\nThat Louis Farrah Khan was was at the funeral and he was on television and in in in print photos what the hell I don't know what a Aretha Franklin's family was thinking\nHaving Lewis ferrets I I don't want

spot on I Would love to see a mainstream reporter or one of the nighttime pundits somebody should and you're right corner Louis Farrakhan and lets a listener response what would he have to say if he was just point blank\nAsk so are your thoughts on this massacre of the Jews and fits Pittsburgh synagogue on Saturday you know how when Louis Farrakhan react that that would be that would be fascinating and I think that is a very very good observation Tom what else did you have\nNo that's all I just like I said I as a sort of Sarah Sanders today in the news comes an immediate went right after President Trump and I'm like you know here's a story that\nIs that I as a sort of Sarah Sanders today in the news comes in the media went right after President Trump and I'm like you know here's

to get the exact store and get the exact verbiage but Twitter left that up\nThere is other hate speech or other um anti religious group or what what's deemed to be said for hate speech that Twitter has removed but to the best of my recollection Twitter\nDid not remove that that remains I Want to dig up the story on our first my memory but I'll get to that are here shortly let's go to Hartford,

building and and hopefully your with with another officer you run into that building you go in that building\nKnowing that either you or your fellow officer will be killed by that person but then you can kill that other person\nI mean that that's that's the way it goes down did that happen like that how can you how how can you possibly get to a point where you could take that man alive if that's the protocol that you used\nWell ah the fact is is that officers did go in I don't we don't have a complete operational breakdown of exactly what happened when they entered I Know the the nine one one call\nFirst rolled in at nine fifty four AM on Saturday morning the cops were on the scene pretty quickly\nWe know that for police officers were shot so that was engagement so they were in\nA ...

I'm Jay foreigners CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchase lender today's fluctuating interest rates can leave you with unexpected higher mortgage payments at Quicken Loans we created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates so you can buy a home with certainty\nYou know he'll call CNN and and and the NBC and MSNBC the fake news so essentially he's calling them the enemy of the people 'cause you're qualifying so to tweets this morning and again I just I don't think that\nThe president should be engaged in this type of Twitter activity especially under the microscope especially since we've had the pipe bombs from last week the synagogue shooting from Saturday morning the president this morning\nIn his first tweet\nThis was ... see what time was this a well he had to hit the actually three tweets don't want to go over because the one this morning rolled out at eight o three am about twelve hours earlier\nIn the eight o'clock hour last night's a Sunday night the president tweeted the fake news is doing everything in their power to blame Republicans conservatives andme me for the division and hatred that has been going on for so long in our country\nActually it is their faith and dishonest reporting which is causing problems far greater than they understand\nI\nI just I don't know why any president needs to engage on this level at eight twelve or so on a Sunday night that the put out that kind of tweak\nThen it continued this morning and this was at\nA does three am\nThe president tweeted there is great anger in our country caused in part by inaccurate and even fraudulent reporting of the news the fake news media the true enemy of the people must stop the open an obvious hostility and report the news accurately and fairly\nThat will do much to point out the flame and then ... dot dot dot then he continues of anger so that will do much to put out the flame of anger and outrage and we will then be able to bring all sides together in peace and harmony\nFake news must and [noise] you know just the the ... and I was saying the the the ramble look the constant resuscitation of the fake news must stop he he's done this\nOn dozens of occasions many many occasions and it's just the same thing over and over again it's it's almost like a you know hit like a Hitler on Harry here ah you know an enough\nThis the president stop it already ... this is\nFrom a guy that's on your side for the most part policy wise but I don't want to see garbage like this silly tweets him the fake news and the enemy of the people\nI mean clearly it makes them feel better that cancer's endorphins rushing him and he feels like he's been slighted or he's been hammered for whatever reason he feels good when he puts his tweet out the fifty five million followers\nAnd I'm Sorry I just don't think the president should operate that way and I'm not going to sit here and say everything he does is fine it's just not\nPlenty of what he does is okay plenty of what he does like light policy\nBut enough already with these tweets it's almost like you know there's a mental disorder with these tweets over and over again and then the fake news we just have the pipe bomb incident with the media was targeted\nMembers of Congress are targeted\nAnd then the safe fake news\nThe media was targeted members of Congress are targeted and that\nThey're safe fake news and then to qualify that the fake news that's the enemy of the people but then we know who he calls fake news so essentially\nThe telegraphing there is that CNN and NBC and those New York times those any calls the fake news that they are the enemy of the people I'm so there's no way to sugarcoat this\nJust stop it Mr President stop\nDon't give them the ability to go after you even further I don't want to comment on this but I'm not going to stick my head up by but like others in talk radio and ignored or think that oh this is perfectly normal and it's OK I'm not going to do it\n\nIt's so much of what this president is doing is good I support is immigration policy yes I support making sure that these migrants don't bust into the country\nI'm not inhumane we have laws and we cannot allow a convoy this this mass collection of people are just say hey I don't want to be in Honduras any longer I've got a trades through Guatemala them through Mexico and then we're coming\nThere's nothing Xena phobic about saying no you're not we have the right way to emigrate to this country um this is not it I support\nThe president I just wish that he wouldn't give us these distractions because there's so much policy that he can focus his energy on instead of making themselves feel good by bashing the media\n\nDon't give them stuff to pass you on oh but for your parents you know I'm I'm realistically observing it from an objective point of view from somebody from the conservative side somebody from\nA policy wise I'm not going to call Trump of conservative 'cause he's not the whole family lifelong Democrats I mean hello folks that throws part of the the interesting little a deal here is Trump lifelong Democrat as donate more Democrats in his career than anyone else\nJared Kushner big time Democrat his whole family big time liberal Democrats market Democrat now that I'm telling you the truth oh Schmidt thoughts about it is true\nOf upcoming from I'm a I'm a lifelong conservative and I'm just calling this ball came as I see it that sold intellectual honesty\nAnd eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number eight hundred

want to hear them allude to the mainstream media is the enemy of the people I don't want that coming out of my white up I don't want that coming out of a an Obama White house which I despised I Want

shouldn't use its it's horrific terminology and then a Jonathan Karl the ABC White House she corresponded or he got\nThe first question today when Sarah Huckabee Sanders went to reporters\nSort of the

story of\nAll I'm scared and I'm sympathetic guy I get it I understand there are legitimate reasons for asylum I'm just not buying a mob of whether it's Seventy five hundred now or fourteen thousand\nThe second ... whatever the number is just not buying you know all these stories\nAnd compassionate person if they're really having ... you know that's legitimate I Wish some of the other news outlets would explain that they don't have a right to come to this country they have a right to go to the first country like that for them and figure\nIt out from there they don't want to know that they want to come here and that's why this things turned into a total circus and a huge publicity stunt Susan thanks for the call from Vegas half hour to go and a lot to cover Red Sox and more next\nThe latest one McKay she knew that he is the second zanu ... am gay eggs in the\nTechnology truth both real money like oh no proof you will have fourteen blogging passwords Andrew can't remember any of them\nAre one or two is such a game's awesome one two three\nAnd the synagogue shooter also said that uh he likes the fact that it's being called an invasion really\nI'm telling you there are many people like me that again are are just absolutely heartbroken and what happened and I want the worst things to happen to that shooter but still just because he says he likes the term invasion I Can't also describe it as an invasion when you have all those people are trying to bust into the country\nOr the demonization of a word I think it I mean you know where I'm coming from a shifting years here are dramatically a for a moment on Saturday Night or I should say on Sunday\nI thought maybe there was a chance that I have the winning Powerball tickets [laughter] of course the odds are or astronomically against me and I when I buy a ticket I don't have those dreams\nI you know those that will buy lottery tickets in their day dreaming or they're dreaming at night when they're actually sleeping ... Rehman sleep and they're thinking about oh my God if I win this thing what am I going to buy what am I going to do with it now I I buy these things knowing that my tickets a loser\nBut also that must have you got to be in it too when somebody does eventually win\nOr some pool of of\nOf meat factory workers [laughter] with somebody wins but here's the deal my wife and I went to Harlem on Saturday nights to grab some pizza\nWe went to ... cheese pizza in Harlem which is on a hundred and seven teams\nAnd first avenue if the original ... the original from Nineteen thirty three there are some other parents these around New York now they're not going to see the if you want ... you got to go to the one on the first avenue one hundred and Seventeen screen in Harlem\nAnd then right down the street there we happened to buy our Powerball tickets for Saturday nights drawing and I whipped out of twenty spots and I bought ten quick picks for Powerball drawing was just a couple of hours away\nAnd then I stuck in my pocket next day I hear\nOr ten quick picks for Powerball drawing was just a couple of hours away and then I stuck in my pocket next day I hear\nA ticket was sold or to Harlem I'll buy you gotta be kidding me really so I grabbed my tickets and I started looking I knew the Powerball was I think it was four\nAnd I'm looking at my tickets and I see I've got a Powerball is for my son about holy month so for a moment like\nHarlem [laughter] it was sold in Harlem and I got the Powerball for that I looked at the other numbers and I'm like yeah I think I'd like one but now it wasn't my ticket the winning ticket there were two winning tickets one was sold in West Harlem\nUp on a hundred and twenty six great my wife and I we went to pass these over in east Harlem and\nOne Seventeen but it was a good story for just a couple of moments but that didn't pan out and the other ticket was sold in a little ... the whimsy place in a convenience store in Wrigley Field Iowa\n\nPopulation seven hundred Seventy two not making it up to tickets one Harlem one\nIowa sharing the Powerball jackpot\nAnd now we thought there was just a little Biddy chest there was a chunk of audio that I did not get around to playing on friday show but I thought it was interesting enough I after the pipe bomber was arrested and the news came down to the arrest on friday\nI was bouncing around I was watching CNN I was watching MSNBC I was watching Fox News channel and I did during the course of my day and I'll I'll flip on CNBC and Fox Business\nI'll make the rounds as I'm doing my ... from the morning until the early afternoon in getting the show formulated and seeing you know what's out there on all my news feeds and Web sites in watching TV and seeing what the hell I Want to talk about\nAnd the story breaks that the police that they moved in they obviously have their eyes on this uh this uh saves are what job with his pipe bombs and he was taken down there at an auto zone implantation Florida as you know\nAnd it turns out that CNN actually broke the news first or CNN among the cable channels I Believe they had at first\nAnd Fox News had no clue and in fact it appears that Sandra Smith\nThe anchor that works with Bill hammer for that late morning news block on Fox it appears that she found out the first that I think the Fox found out that there was at a rest is they were watching CNN and you\nGot to hear this audio because so let me let me let me lay out the landscape for you\nYou have the anchors that ... those desks and sometimes they have computers up on the desk in many occasions on the glass counter top there are monitors that are slanted in an angle that they can look into their glass counter top and they can view a variety of things\nAnd in many cases the competing networks\nAre run in a monitor either off to the side or in the table so the anchors can see what's going on if there is anything breaking on the competing news networks so listen to this and when I heard this I knew exactly\nOn the competing news networks so listen to this and when I heard this I knew exactly what had transpired what had gone on so you can you hear the voice of bill hammer first\nAnd bill hammer or they're ... they're going to break and bill hammer first is going to talk about coming up this and that but listen to win the Sandra Smith the female anchor when her voice pops him\nIn a moment to live with your friends are saying the search for suspected how far along they have more have not gotten Katherine Harris has got some new information as well we will tap and all of that as our coverage continues on a ... says is funny what CNN her\n[laughter] so she he finishes up she thinks that my kids down and she must have caught a glimpse of the monitor where it said a breaking news arrest maid and she was CNN is reporting ooh ooh and the ... that she was still hot\nAnd that the mice were not down 'cause you could hear that little sound effect that's the sound and that was the Fox animation coming in what America's Newsroom or whatever it says and it just priceless when she goes on CNN is reporting\nSo she was telling everyone in the studio there that see I I this is the way I think that it transpired that she was about to say oh CNN is reporting that they they made the arrest\nDwell we will tap and all of that as our coverage continues on a mother says is funny more CNN\nCNN report oh and then she realized oaks so I think that's how Fox News found out that the arrest was made in the pipe bomb case that\nThey were watching CNN and that's how they found out an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine of the nation wide number I saw I lost my call ... let me know if there's anything a compelling that I Need to get too if
