who were type vehicles limos that oh what changes\nWhen you get in your car\nIn the front seat or the passenger seat you buckle up most people buckle up but there is this this is dropping of people's guard when they get into certain vehicles and I was mentioned Bob Simon from CBS News he got into a a one of these black car limos\nA you know one of these you know for a Lincoln town cars style of vehicles and there was an accident on the west side highway or ...\nBut he in Manhattan and he wasn't built to them and he he died a blunt force trauma he died because he became a ping pong ball inside the vehicle the driver who I Believe had a sequel to the driver of the car was fine\nI just implore you please if you ride in a limo car service a taxi and you're in the backseat put your seatbelt on whenever I'm In the vehicles of that nature with my wife my kids I first thing I say seatbelts on I double check\nBecause there's this again false sense that oh nothing's going to happen and something happened\nAnd I'm going to guess that it is going to come out that this foreign excursions stretch limousine accident up in New York state with a Eighteen people dead inside I'm going to guess that the passengers in the back\nEither there were not enough seatbelt or working seatbelts or they did not have seatbelts on even if it were an option\nWhat a what a horrific tragedy Kennedy you know the ... and this is what blows my mind is that the NTSB is comparing that limo crash in New York state\nTo the last ... mass casualty transportation crash it was that Colgan Air crash outside of buffalo were a dash ada acute four hundred dash shaped a airplane a proper a turbo prop crashed into a house\nOn approach into the buffalo airport that was two thousand nine were around fifty die and I think one person on the ground died and then everyone on the airplane died and it was a Colgan Air it was operating is United Express it was a flight from Newark international liberty or to buffalo\nAnd don't get me started on that crashed 'cause I mean the inexperience crew did everything wrong\nWhen they were stalling they pulled up when in fact you push down on a stick you get air speed to get out of the stall you don't pull up that\nThat that yeah that makes the sole even worse and they were doing they went into a corkscrew in their right into the ground\nBut the point is the MPs me to put things into perspective this was the deadliest transportation crash whether it's air whether it's rail boss a vehicle since two thousand nine with Eighteen people dead\nIn his vehicle and then two on the ground to air in a parking lot to put it into perspective there was a plane crash\nThat had the next ah you know have that have the highest death toll and this goes back to two thousand nine justices absolutely are unbelievable uh folks let's get back in the cabinet for a minute here about please buckle up it's my Schmidt public service good deed announcement of the day please\nBuckle up now on to cabinet as I promised I wanted to go back to grab some calls here and just a bit and then the the victory all the venom I've got a pile of poison [laughter]\n[laughter] I'm

ground oh are you know I Will\nDo that hang on a sec ah\nGeorge is on the line calling from New York City Georgia's a license limo driver let me before I go to Kevin let me grab this call because George being a license limo driver I'm sure it's something to say about this horrific crash George welcome to Schmidt Hi\nHi how are you as a ... until November twenty Seventeen we were not legally required as drivers to wear seatbelts in the car\nI'm nor with the passengers a into in November twenty Seventeen the law was changed and or the New York a traffic a vehicle code was changed so that it was a violation not to wear them\nUm there's a presumption on the part of the writing public that they're going to be safe because they're being driven by a professional\nAnd um so typically they're correct I'm\nIn New York City taxi cabs and limousines get into very few fatal accidents over so um [noise] that's correct but everybody should buckle up as you said more importantly um most of these cabs I'm should have the airbags operational for the back seat\nOf some of them with the petitions do not\nWhat are your thoughts when you heard that this was in two thousand one for the excursion modified strength through a vehicle that old should that be on the roads\nAre maintained it will be fine that's no problem or you know the problem with this intersection is is that there were a three semi trailer truck accidents that occurred there as well uh in which they went through the parking lot of this uh particular restaurant or a\nA shopping center and a resulted in crashes now a tractor trailers are driven by people who have commercial driver's licenses Taipei and they also have their breaks\nAnd apparently a this intersection is so dangerous that air brakes on a tractor trailer couldn't stop it so I mean even if the car was a um a twenty Eighteen or twenty Nineteen a vehicle um it could very well be that it couldn't have stopped at the center section because of the design of the roadway yeah\nBut also the governor of New York said that this limo had recently failed inspection this explosion should not have been on the road plus the driver didn't have the proper endorsement didn't have the right didn't have a little license\nWhile he actually has to have a commercial driver's license because he has more than fourteen passengers\nYou have to have a commercial driver's license see or commercial driver's license be in New York state law and order to transport that large or a group of people are there are some drawbacks to having a converted car made into a stretch limousine namely the fact that you don't have air brakes you're dependent upon hydraulic braking systems\nThat may or may not be ... or meant that there is a way to augment the uh the driving system in medium duty trucks which involves\nUsing the power steering pumped to power a a a booster to the um [noise] hydraulic braking system that's on the car or truck and are most likely this was not present 'em so\nYour guy on there that resulted in the result that in the uh ...\nGeorgia when I'm when I'm getting here is that you know what you're talking about the use you certainly seemed to have a whole lot of experience\nAnd this is just heartbreaking story to hear that uh you know married couples you know you have kids that are ...

I I I I could swear like a year or two ago there was some kind of movement\nTo try this to him I don't think it's going to happen to try to split Colorado between liberal and and more conservative with a northern Colorado in uh southern Colorado so but I Will say So Tim if you've turned into a Trump fan and your wife clearly despises Trump\nHow often do you guys get into it\nWe we we don't ah we were just making a point not to discuss politics each other we've uh we we live you know that's one good thing I like about living in this little small town in Colorado I can I can pretty much tune out\nAll the rest of the more crap going around in the country you know we can just live our lives and be happy you know ah unfortunately politics is an issue that comes up sometimes but it's it's very rare\nDo you ski Oh yes sir I I've never skied so I moved out here I was thirty two my first time I stress ... gone I I Love it\nThat's fantastic now being you're in Carbondale where do you ski where do you like to go\nI I like to go to snow master Aspen or highlands yup\nI I've ...

Tim I appreciate and have a great day eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine Hey Sue turn on your microphone I I think sue just looked up the that movement to try to split Colorado's ... when was that so\nYeah there I haven't read the whole article but Colorado secession vote fizzles rural counties split on fifty first state initiative and that was November of twenty Thirteen\nI says five years ago that's that's that's why I Try and remember we talked about it on the program has it been five years\nSince that wow that's incredible I let's finish up with my my Kavanaugh poison pile here the follow up on the Georgetown professor\nAnd this was just vile there was a Georgetown professor in Washington DC who wished miserable death saw Republicans\nAnd wanted the G O P male senators to beat\nCastrated well folks\nWe might have some justice here and at least it seems like a good decision was made in what is mostly liberal academia\nTurns out that\nAs the spending this female professor because of her tweet\nWhere she said that Republican senators who support Brett Kavanaugh Trump's nominee ought to be killed and castrated isn't that lovely\nHow is fat for tolerance isn't that killed and cash grade and that's just so warm and it's just you know\nIn the arm the liberal embrace isn't that just phenomenal Carol Christine fair who is called a distinguished associate professor within the school of foreign service\nAnd Washington D.C.'s Georgetown University's according to the Washington Examiner willing stands travel internationally for university research instead of teaching\nSo there was a swift and decisive move from Georgetown because of this completely irrational insensitive viral and grotesque tweet\nTo prevent further disrupt into her students and out of an abundance of caution for the security of our community we have mutually agree for professor fair to go on research leave affective immediately it's according to the foreign service school dean Joel Helmand\nBring up the hill ovens and bring out the best he wrote this in a statement to staff\nAccording to the Washington Examiner they were quoting Fox News professor farewell accelerate previously scheduled International Research travel so let's get this straight so apparently she was getting ready to travel for research ah\nAcademic work\nBut they've accelerated it sounded like they bumped this sucker up numerous investors or maybe a year or two who the hell knows weekend and strongly do could definitely use of violent imagery profanity and insensitive labeling of individuals based on gender ethnicity or\nPolitical affiliation in any form of\nDiscourse Helmand roads so you know what there is hope that\nA liberal academia and they have recognized that this professor wishing dance and cashed ration two Republican senators supporting cab and all\nThat the school said this is inappropriate and we're essentially a ban issue when it's actually going to put you out to pasture or are we going to send you off or get a you know lock you up in the attic and getting locked up in the advocate ... means\nThat they're going to send their off on her research travels overseas [laughter] so sabbatical right [laughter]\n[laughter] uh I mean we talked about this last week when I when I saw the story\nThat she was dancing cashed rations so you know I have to hand it to Georgetown University and the fact that they did move swiftly and the fact is that while they they probably don't want capital either\nAnd this this theme\nOf this uh what the foreign service school deem as Joel Helmand I'm guessing he wasn't a capital than either probably didn't want cabinet confer but it just shows that there is there is some hope here that they can recognize that the um\nTheir own overstepped their bounds we see you got to keep that to yourself so essentially I think what we're [laughter] this is for this is probably unfair\nBut maybe a you know Joel held them this foreign service deem maybe he thought of this you know in turtle himself but just in vocalizing or many other faculty members at Georgetown uh probably all along these lines I'm not saying that they wish death in cash regime but I'm sure that they were more agreement with\nOr anywhere\nHey Sean Spicer and every mid term

discovery crossing traditionally conditions equal housing winter licensing office effects analyst number thirty thirty visual conditioned arts whose ...\nWhere for fast track as a showing it making landfall right now that could change a little bit over the course of time\nLet's talk intensity now over the years the actual forecast path has gotten better intensity is still one of those areas where we're still trying to get better\nI so now where where where to category one the five o'clock eastern advisory for central had the maximum sustained winds at eighty miles an hour or so up five from the intermediate forecasted at two PM\nAnd you guys are projecting it to intensify to it too and then potentially a three what makes landfall on the Florida coastline is that correct\nThat's correct or were explicitly forecasting a store to become a major hurricane and about thirty six hours while\nIt's still out over the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico or then as it makes a term or to North northeast and because the poster for the panhandle might see a little bit of slight weakening but still be near\nMajor hurricane strength and the reason why we have the sub category of major hurricane intensities because statistically about eighty five percent of major hurricanes\nAccount for most of the damage that we see with land falling storms\nAre you on a confidence level do you think we're going to see this as hit the panhandle or\nYou'll around or near Panama City too I now as far as the tracking are are you looking at more of the east worldly bias or is it still up in the air whether it does go to the west of Panama City\nWhere you got some good questions Todd we have a reconnaissance aircrafts or from Noah headed in there right now give us a more information on where the exact center is but looking at satellite imagery right now it looks like the storm is not deviated or anywhere to the left like the models have been indicating is still moving north and maybe even a little eastern north so we might have to see some\nEastward adjustments a end the track a you know maybe closer to Appalachia cola but again the the storms will be relatively large so anywhere from certainly Panama City east where it to the Tallahassee area is probably going to see the worst conditions associated with Michael\nAnd once it does strike the Florida coast and again listen I Wish you know being a Floridian ah since Nineteen Ninety two when I arrived just after Andrew and saw the aftermath of that you know I don't wish this on anybody but\nYou know as far as the big ... big band Appalachian coal is certainly it's it's much less populated then if you pushed further west you know towards the Fort Walton Beach Panama City or a nice little etc deaths than\nThat is correct Todd uh right now you know all indications are with like\nAnd fall from Panama City little Easter there and some of the lesser populated areas excluding you know the Tallahassee area that is a fairly significant populations that are getting the state capital\nNo moisture wise you know once it does strike Florida and it moves pretty quickly according to the forecast pass into Georgia South Carolina North Carolina I Virginia exiting somewhere maybe along the Carolina Virginia border back out into the Atlantic\nI I mean we're talking about adding insult to injury or ask your obviously what could be significant damage from a category two or a category three but then the rainfall amounts over already saturated areas could be intense as well right\nNow that is correct uh unfortunately uh Michael we'll be taking a path to the northeast moving across the Carolinas the areas that were devastated by flooding from Hurricane Florence\nOh about a month or so ago I'm sort of a maybe a good new situation as it is going to be moving quickly uh and that will lessen\nThe amount of rainfall that they'll get so they're not going to be getting you know any of the you know two feet three feet\nRainfall ... there'll be seeing but you know even six to eight inches of rain\nOr would obviously create a some problems for them there but another thing they have to consider is all that water than standing for a long time the root systems are now going to be just saturated not very stable so it's a storm moves through it won't take much when to start popping up a lot of trees are in the Carolinas especially uh eastern North Carolina where they had all the flooding\nAnd we saw that horrific story unfold you remember the mother an infant that were killed when a tree fell and hit their house in North Carolina\nYes a very bad and so we don't want people to look at this and say oh well the storm is going to be weakening to fifty mile per hour winds well those fifty mile per hour winds uh will be up there in the tops of those tall pines\nAnd we measure the wind at the surface a self uh pine tree is sixty eighty feet tall winds up there can easily be ten miles per hour faster and what the roots are already saturated the ground very soft a trees typically will go down and much less winds of what you normally would require\nAnd as I've always learned or if you're a high rise building if you're a twenty thirty stories up or you could see a category jump or an increase because of the altitude\nThat's correct so when we forecast a\nMichael to be near you know major hurricane strength near category three intensive you want to make landfall in the Florida Panhandle if people were in high rise apartments up around you know two hundred feet or so they could easily see a winds up there at that altitude a you know when you're a category four string\nAre amazing and then let's talk timeline where a last I saw were looking at an event impacting the or the Florida Panhandle host of Wednesday afternoon to Wednesday evening is that timeline still current\nWill officially a we're showing landfall Wednesday afternoon a roughly about uh you know between two and five o'clock but we don't want people to focus on that specific time because the storm as a quite large ... wins significant wins or at least tropical storm force will begin to affect\nThe coastal areas there with the Florida Panhandle labor from Appalachia cola up to near Panama City or easily by early Wednesday morning before the sun comes up\nRight Stacy Stuart thank you so much for the times senior hurricane specialist National Hurricane center in the Miami area Stacey thanks for joining us Amish that show you what we thought thank you\nBye bye bye again those that are listening in the panhandle please I mean you don't have a lot of time here in this timeline is compressed\nBecause the storm is already in the Gulf of Mexico\nThree is the forecast when it hits near Panama City so my thoughts are with everyone listening\nIn the panhandle and then up toward Tallahassee a and then into southern Georgia obviously across the middle of the state and then into South Carolina\nOr North Carolina into it looks like it'll rain wise once this thing gets moving we're looking at the you know upstate South Carolina Greenville Spartanburg area looks like I mean there are projected winds and rain and and then uh you know across a Raleigh Durham is well across the triangle area\nAn eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number here on Smith eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on the program I mentioned Taylor Swift\nTaylor Swift there's not jumping into the political fray here\nTara swift who is brought us such deep lyrics as\nHis eyes we hadn't seen each other and um when you read it\nAgain today the un I found that it changed how that lasted for a day I said you mean breakout economy\nKnow Barry I'll tell you write that Taylor Swift is not jumping into the political fray and fantasy\n[noise] oh no oh these literature so the [noise]\nUm [noise] they fight\nSo who knows Taylor Swift think that she's going to influence I mean Taylor Swift fans are like Thirteen Years old how many Taylor Swift fans are going to be voting in the mid term elections\n[noise] came [noise]\nLike I mean I I you know what Thirteen Years old or to enjoy those lyrics might be on meet the higher side but that might be the upper end of the demographic All right so the latest with Taylor Swift\nIs as follows Taylor Swift is now in door to sing to democratic candidates in Tennessee\nHer home state she's twenty eight years old now she is essentially stayed quiet on the political front you know not wanting\nTo alienate any of her fan base but again I'm like does it matter I mean their fans are like nine and ten and twelve years old Thirteen Years old\nYeah so she is now in ... and there's a contentious a tight Tennessee race she is endorsing democratic former governor Phil Bredesen\nA and she also is speaking out against us representative Marsha Blackburn\nYeah the Republican nominee\nReally really tailor you got to jump in his uh she's a endorsed uh this is vi Instagram last night", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "year": "2018", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "08"}
