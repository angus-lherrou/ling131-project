[noise] [noise]\n... [noise] like Hitler Republicans have signify then as the they're reading the supplemental FBI investigation there\nIs nothing new there is nothing to corroborate the allegations made by Dr Ford or the second accuser this Deborah Ramirez\nThere's nothing absolutely zero you know when you have one of the big guys CNN political commentators is David ... when you hear him say that the ball game is over meaning that Kavanaugh is going to be confirmed\nI you know that that that's pretty damn significant because of the way that flake\nAnd Collins our signal find if they're going to vote that they are yes notes however I I'm I'm not saying that this is a hundred percent over because we are thrown curve balls I mean it's a look when we aren't look how we've got here I nothing is certain anymore nothing absolutely zero but it is walking like\nKavanaugh's headed toward a confirmation I even though he has been just unfairly maligned in ... and destroyed and his family has kids his wife I mean it's really just grotesque and essentially\nThe Democrats they have resulted\nEssentially to argue\nA about the process right so\nYou know Democrats are left with nothing else to argue except about the process and when you're down to making arguments about process well kind of means you're losing and you're losing bad so as far as when I got the quotes here\nAnd again I I don't think you'd get a hundred percent count on anything but this is the way it certainly is looking that Collins inflate you're going to yes because Collins' Susan Collins from Maine\nSaid quote it appears to be a very thorough investigation but I'm going back later today to personally read the interviews that's really all I have to say right now but it appears to be a very thorough investigation\nIs what columns and of course tolerances rely on a lot of staffers and and you know her other colleagues et cetera flight\nJeff Flake said we ask the FBI to investigate current credible allegations that's what they've done I plan to vote for him before but I certainly wanted the FBI the professionals to look at it and may have and I think they've been thorough\n[noise] ah so all you need you don't need the Democrats you don't meet Joe Manchin don't mean Heidi Heitkamp Heidi Heitkamp told a TV station in Fargo North Dakota earlier today but she's an over so mention is still on the side\nUh so if you get Collins and you get flake then it's a done deal or you don't even need Murkowski by the way Murkowski you this\nLike the Murkowski told reporters that she did not yet know whether the FBI had been thorough enough that its investigation or spoken to enough witnesses asked whether she felt that she had been given enough time to consider the decision before voting this weekend Murkowski added\nI certainly hope so yes so that's what we're getting now from ... county they will need Murkowski flights towns eight hundred three eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine more Schmidt and your calls

or in one day Twenty one hours\nSo there are twelve bids now for one of these uh mark judge books a hard copy from uh it's right now a current event is it a hundred thirty five dollars or let's go to phones saying oh why does it before I go to calls in a suit can you try to fire up my screen or from the real quick here\nCan you give me a a a reconnect on my screen or 'cause my my phone screen or dropped off a thank you guys I appreciate it one other observation this is what's really sick\nAnd sand here\nThere are protests going on right now as we speak there are protests that are occurring\nAre at the U.S Capitol inside the Senate office building\nSo I'm looking now at Capitol Hill police they are a arresting some protesters right now they're using the the plastic a zip tie handcuffs\nI see a guy in a in a safari hat and a ... an awful ugly green plaid shirt being taken away a\n... now some women are sitting down a obviously they're being asked to move and they're not so they are resisting so now we have another Capitol Hill police officer applying zip ties to a female protester now\nOr who's being hauled away so arrests are being made inside the Senate office building\n... and this is what the Serbs me is you know they're they're screaming you know rape is you know never again a there was also a whole busload of protesters that got on a bus\nIn Chelsea in Manhattan or earlier this morning they got on a bus to them drive down to DC to join these protests\nAnd I heard a soundbite from an individual that was saying that I was sexually assaulted a I was\nRaped and Kavanaugh is guilty and I\nYou know this can happen I just it disturbing beyond belief that there is no proof there is no corroboration here and then all of these individuals I think that Brett Kavanaugh is a sexual assault or a a a deviant a rapist\nAnd it's just colossally unfair it's just not right\nWith no proof and again you've heard that in this particular case Kavanaugh is guilty until proven innocent and I'm Sorry that's not the way things work here in the United states and it's just a shame and even if Kavanaugh is confirmed and it's starting to look that way\nThere's got to be a stain from these individuals' and there's always going to be this taped\nIt a lot of the Clarence Thomas issue with Anita Hill\nYou know will this fate or as you're always going to be this cloud of those that are pointing fingers in calling him the rapist on the Supreme Court that is just grossly grossly unfair that this individual even though there is no cooperation of Dr Ford story her memory is fuzzy on so many levels\n\nThat so many people are just automatically convicted Brett Kavanaugh it's just unfair or let's sit in your phone calls thanks for the\nFor the patients in waiting if you want to get an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine eight hundred eight zero one eight nine nine nine let's go to Debbie in Columbus, Indiana\nDebbie your first step today on Schmidt hello\nHello how are you I'm doing fine go ahead [noise]\nI I had a comment on statement that you had made earlier about Dr Ford sounding like a baby\nWhat has that really got to do with being honest or dishonest\nOr oh I never said anything to do what I said was that when she first has to find a week ago today that when she started testifying\nThan I as long with a ... I\nAlong with many were just surprised that she had this very childlike sounding deliberate with the cry glee a vocal fry sounding voice in I was just making the observation that it was it was it was strange was odd well\nI mean we all have different voices you know be a very boring world if we all found or like you or am I sell\nThem W W I wasn't I'm just making the observation I I I observe for a living and it's not just me many were surprised when she had that very childish sounding cried least sounding voice I it was just an observation\nThat I was making and I I had a female I had this this a listener a limb from Tampa wrote me an email today\nWanting to know I Wish that some of her former students who confirmed when she was lecturing and when she was teaching her psychology classes did she have that same voice in the same delivery or was that sort of an act before Congress\nI don't think it was enacted I think that it was probably her voice just like my voice a lot of people think I sound like a man many and I am not I am a female\nOr I never doubted ... data you don't sound like a man to me\nWell you're in a million that doesn't think so anyway I just had to comment on that because I don't even I mean it's it's I I don't think it was an act at all with her\nOh my God you're you're certainly you're entitled to her opinion now do you think that she's telling the truth the do you believe that Brett Kavanaugh\nSexually assaulted Dr Ford back when she was Fifteen Years old\nMaybe if he if he was a drink or any blackout he might not even remember it you just don't know and I don't think that the F. B.
