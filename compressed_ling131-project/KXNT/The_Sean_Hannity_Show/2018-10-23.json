accounts you know the president on friday we there was a news reporting in an audio by that he thought that the Saudi excuse was somewhat credible than that shifted over the weekend a you know now\nYou know the latest from the president is that the President Trump is not satisfied with the explanation of the show ... killing so that's the latest now\nFrom President front and he had ... different takes on this I just offer it up a suggestion yesterday that the president just likes to get you get you're going like say that just talking yack and a lot of times it it gets him into trouble because\nHe changes his story I don't know if he remembers what he said one moment to the next\nIt just it would serve our president better if he would just in a manner like this just don't say anything specific just say oh we're very alarmed by this\nAre we going to wait until there's a full investigation and we have all the facts in details instead of speculating and originally saying oh yeah I find that plausible and they don't\nAnd he took a lot of course the criticism for that on both sides of the aisle\nAnd it's a necessary but again we've got the president can help themselves on ah the\nOn the ... the the the ... city a situation just they can't\nCan't stop himself but he needs to sell the latest from our early gun today medicines kind of a let down on a disappointment because you know yesterday were being teased about this big reveal that ah that he was going to deliver the the naked truth about the show he's death\nAnd you know surprisingly especially too I Would imagine the really really really nervous a puck Hering that's right the royals have a partner factor to folks are and they had to be nervous about what are the guard was going to reveal\nUh so yeah they they were uh there were a little shaky I'm sure down in Riyadh on what was going to come out here but er to God was very\nAh so yeah they they were a little shaky I'm sure down in Riyadh on what was going to come out here but er to God was very deferential toward the king or never mentioned the crown prince at all\nIn the address to the Turkish Parliament he did say that the murder was quote savagely plan\nAnd it was carried out by the salaries are he said I got some notes here from his speech from the translation he said the Saudis inside the consulate turned off\nThe closed circuit TV feed hours before the show he was due to arrive which I'm are as obviously further evidence that this whole damn thing was premeditated\nThey said that the Eighteen men identified by the Saudis on friday of the same Eighteen Saudis the Turks identified as being responsible and of course they know who they know who came into the country and the passport scans and and the video from a passport control of the airport itself they know this\nSo that's about like the the the Eighteen agreement on both sides and it's about the only thing I guess they're going to agree on here you know the Saudis still maintain the death was not intentional or to God that mentioned\nOr any kind of a tape recording of the murder as we've heard a didn't offer any physical evidence\nAnd he called on the Saudis to be more forthcoming to\nDisclose where a cause show he's remains are and who in Turkey is responsible or was responsible for the disposal of the remains you know the the Saudis had this taco made me a excuse oh yeah they turn the body over to some local guy and they they don't know his name\nThey uh they lost his cell number they come on really and there's some new details on the body\nBefore we go to phones here in a moment\nOr some new details on the body or\nOr early gum the the Turkish president wants or Saudi Arabia to turn all of the suspects over to Turkish authorities so they can be tried in Turkey\nI listen there's no doubt that the crown prince that MBBS Mohammed bin ... he knew about this was totally signed off and I'm sure authorized by him but are they going to make these Eighteen folks all guys will they take the fall for the kingdom and not throw a a prince ... under the bus\nThat's going to remain to be seen whether they're going to turn them over I I I doubt they're going to turn him over the Turkish authorities but you know we'll see you know he summed it all off by saying that it was a political murder that was plotted by the Saudis days and weeks ahead of the actual events and it was a\nLittle more than ... than in the past couple of weeks but I was measured enough that the uh the Saudi royals were surprised a Saudi royals apparently thought that he was going to go a whole lot further\nWith some of the details they've uncovered so I mean the Saudis we're like whoa whoa whoa ride or not as bad as we thought here as far as what are the guys said so earning on speech this uh you know came as the Saudi investments summit\nKicked off a as well as another conference which\nI was focusing on counter terrorism or you know Steve Mnuchin our treasury

theory about being a nationalist Albert I'm all for it I'm somebody that loves our country when I say a nationalist I don't like it when Germany Spain one percent of GDP for NATO and we're\n... we are listening to the president or these remarks just moments ago in the oval office and being turned around by the press move video right now we're paying for and you know with Trump at the rally a\nThere was a recent rally calling himself a nationalist summer trying to suggest that he meant that he was a white nationalist with ... ... per pot stores or store\nFarmers were farmers cannot sell in Europe they have trade barriers that make it you guys know it's better than anybody they on trade barriers that or as severe as China's trade barriers which we coming down they want to make a deal very badly there'll be coming down\nBut I Am very proud of our country we cannot continue to allow what's happened to our country to continue to have or get let it happen so I'm proud proud of our country that I Am a nationalist it's a word that has been used too much some people use it but I'm very proud I think it should be brought back\nI'm somebody that wants to help other countries of the world [noise]\nBut I also have to take him to take care of our country we cannot continue to allow\nOurselves to be duped on military and also duped contracts with the European Union as an example last year on trade we lost one hundred and fifty one billion dollars on top of that we lost hundreds of billions of dollars on protection [laughter] so we protect\nYeah you know it's just not reasonable that the Trump declares himself a nationalist which I don't have an issue with that you're nationalist you care about our nation you care about the United states of America First I and for some to say that he called himself a naturalist ah that's\nI spoke with border patrol this morning that spoke to him last evening and I spoke to him did they before speak to him all the time and they say and you know this as well as anybody over the course of the year over the course of a number of years they've intercepted many people\nFrom the middle east they've intercepted ISIS they've intercepted all sorts of people they've intercepted good ones in bad ones they've intercepted wonderful people for the middle east and they've intercepted bad ones they've intercepted\nWonderful people from South America and from other parts are probably scent further south they've intercepted a lot of different people but among the people they've intercepted very recently are people from the middle east okay\nSo you can't be surprised when you hear it you've heard that before it happens all the time\nOr again the media now is going to demand proof of the reporters are going to ask the White House press secretary what can you please I get us the information from customs and border protection and tell us about ISIS that's been interested and tell us about middle Easterners so the media is going to glom onto this and I don't know if the president has the good the proof\nIs no proof of anything there's no proof of anything [laughter] it's like they could very well be if you look at what that\nBuilding you know they were talking about five or six thousand people in pretty good at estimating crowd size as you probably have figured out you tend to get a little bit off the real number last night as an example [noise]\nThat was record setting stuff was that but they don't want to talk about that but I Will tell you let me just say that I really I Believe that ... that was pretty big says pretty

know whether a suicide\nSong you're listening to the replay from just a short time ago and the president in the oval office and he's maintaining that there are middle Easterners and the caravan you but there is no specific proof events are accurate at this point\nSo I think I think very I think there is a very good chance honestly that said you have people in there I also think there's a very good chance that over the course of the time you have for that don't have to necessarily be in that group but certainly you have people coming up through the southern border from the middle east

the rally in Montana the other night\nWith Greg when President Trump praised regimen Ford say I'm for bodies slamming Ben Jacobs I remember looking over to the supporters and the crowd and there was

cut your throat and you know just\nIt'll let the record show and you couldn't see it because this is radio is that Jim Acosta did a a finger across the throat so like the throat slashing motion\nThat went up to him after was over and I talk to them about it and and he was a sort of laughing about it and I I guess he wasn't serious about\nNow why would you ever costs to go up to just ignore it if you have some folks with a mob mentality and those are my fan of uh Jim Acosta I'm not have I seen him do good coverage good fat filled coverage I have\nHave I seen him trying to make himself part of

to catch him\nI was ... Jim has on numerous occasions tried to inject himself in to make himself part of the equation instead of reporting on the equation\nThe story obviously is what I'm referring to so I've criticized him

out and try to behave badly you're like in other civil a gathering and you know shouting down reporters and chanting CNN sucks I'm Sorry it doesn't reflect well\nOn those that go to these rallies and it gives those that are opposed the Trump it gives the you know those that are are opposed to a conservatives in conservative media it just gives those individuals ammunition\nAnd I don't want to be lumped in math I mean I'm a conservative but I don't want to be lumped in the same corral is a crowd that's you know chanting CNN sucks and doing throats slash motions to Jim Acosta\nOr yelling and cursing and ask for you and this and I'm Sorry\nI don't want to be a part of that it comes across as low class so it doesn't make me happy so that was a cost the you know talking about\nYou know some
