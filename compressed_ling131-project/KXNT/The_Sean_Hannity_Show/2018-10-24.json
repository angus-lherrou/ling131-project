Fairfield mark you're on hit it you just wanted to ask you at what point did drop the PC tiptoeing around but caravans and start calling it\nA the invasion than it is I mean it's that attack on American sovereignty I mean I was just wondering what the average rate looks like I just looked at the New Orleans a thousand British troops real about New Orleans you know they were coming to do war against the United states take our\nProperty this now is whatever the number is ... teams of thousands you know Fifteen them the whatever the cameras\nAnd they're coming to take our our monetary resources you know they're ... they're not coming violently but\nFirst act as a potential American citizen is breaking laws and then the second act or the consequence of them break in our laws which is\nConsuming our resources in one of the things that you can do quite easily that you know United States taxpayers spend billions on illegal immigrant healthcare\nEveryone we know adolescent at ... ... talk to hospitals administrators\nAnd hospitals across the country especially those in some of these border states I mean they're getting nailed getting hammered with all this illegal alien this indigent care it's bleeding them\nAnd you know part of that is you know why are people that show up they get charged or you know thirty seven dollars for an aspirin and you know so ah let's mark a hundred percent it isn't\nAnd you know part of that is you know why are people that show up they get charged or you know thirty seven dollars for an aspirin and you know so a list of mark a hundred percent it is an invasion it needs to be withheld\nThere is no expectation that you can knock on our door and we have to let you in I mean do at the right way we welcome immigrants to this country but not mobs that are now the caravan allegedly like fourteen thousand strong as a secretary advantage for him\nAnd it needs to be stopped and I I I'm not politically correct I'm gonna tell you right now they're illegal aliens that are trying to break our laws by busting through our front door illegally and yeah\nThe Trump Administration or any administration or has\nThe fiduciary responsibility to stop it you know I don't know if you heard the audio clip of President Trump tweeted out and\nObama sound bite or from Obama years ago talking about\nOr he did did you see that are diverted yeah yeah I mean I was like if you agree\nWith Obama with your with the current administration on the need to enforce the laws got the kind of thing and then you know that the media keep ... you know regurgitate in this uh the racism and\nAnti immigrant thing but I mean what there's a everybody an American story of a friend I I've gotten numerous\nFriends of all nationalities you know north south east and west of the border\nWho have wives and family members that have come in legally follow the process and and just shake their head why you know why do these people who won't follow the process and won't fall a lot in fact openly flop law\nWhy do they deserve our respecting compassion particularly when they purposefully organize\nYou know with with the goal of of flouting or\n[noise] or you're not going to get an artist and we're on we're on the same page and you know I have the audio bite so President Trump about twenty two hours ago he tweeted out I agree with President Obama one hundred percent\nAnd old and a from a tweet it out a video of then Senator Barack Obama from Illinois where he said this\nAnd listen here carefully there are a generous and welcoming people here in the United states for those who enter the country illegally and those who employ them just respect the rule of law and they are showing disregard for those who are following the law\nWe simply cannot allow people to pour into the United states undetected undocumented unchecked and circumventing the line of people who are waiting patiently diligently unlawfully or the becomes immigrants in this country\nSo there it is and a Trump retweeted Obama senator then and Obama's a hundred percent right in front of a say I agree a hundred percent more thanks for the call let's go to a oh let's say in Connecticut let's go to Robin Danbury, Connecticut Rob you're on Schnell hello\nHey how's it going west and uh I Do have one comment about the care of it I called up and making Kelly thing but yeah you know I I Wonder why why is not a president or the start\nPutting this on the state's wired wired and not getting the states in front of and voicing their concern you know especially like sanctuary states are proposing a solutions where do you\nKnow because the the craziest thing of the world is the catch and release right we catch them give them a court date and let him go free right are we not proposing some type of working with they were willing to accept these illegals ... and ... and her band voice their concerns me is the practice\nPosing some type of working with they were willing to accept these illegals and then had ... known as the president or are we want you to protect us because it's going to backfire on on the part of the matter what he does\nAnd you're you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't\nAnd you you have the century states you like look at look at California\nCalifornia is um one of the largest recipients if not the largest of the illegal immigrants a migration\nAnd look how their resources on a state level attached\nBut you know they're they're willing to accept that it it's unbelievable and either you your survey you know the bulk of these democratic politicians in California they'll tell you open borders I mean they're insane they they just don't get it a rub you wanted to talk about Megan Kelly as well\nYeah you're not good for the clarification and forgive me if you're already talked about the origin of the ... my understanding is is that at a time when black people were not allowed to perform in white performances whether it's plays were early movies\nThat the characters were put on black face to portray the black characters in other words they weren't using wax days to mock lynching right this was just the same I guess many many years before that women weren't allowed to perform right so the men took on the women's roles as well\nSo I'm just wondering why this outrage Pittsburgh people now are allowed to perform right and ... and they're quite\nWhy do you live someone wants to portray a black person for Halloween but example making probably gave 'em to be Diana Ross wouldn't make\nYeah be Rob was because of a minstrel show activity\nAnd just the the racist over the top exaggerated performances that did occur a blackface is not acceptable and the way that it has been portrayed I I Can't make any argument\nOr or agree with you on that point today what's the big deal here it has been unacceptable a for decades and decades even you know prior to this ah overwhelming wave of what we'll call you know political correctness it hasn't been All right I Can't make an excuse for it\nAnd your million Kelly's a lawyer she's really smart and woman who took a stupid position on a TV show she openly I play the audio I play three different clips Lynch was talking about Diana Ross and then also as kids what's wrong with black face and this and that\nUm it was just a dopey thing and don't be can of worms to open up and I even asked the question on my Twitter feed earlier today on my\nAct Todd shipped\nA Twitter feed I asked the question now let me let me take this up a ... I tweeted out\nAnd I agree with you by the way it was done for her to bring it up\nMean it it it really was and I I Want to find oh here's writes weeded out will NBC use an ethics or a content clause if applicable\nTo get out of the jumbo Megan Kelly contract she is much too smart to of waded into this mess because if I'm not mistaken she signed this three year sixty nine million dollar contract I mean just you know humongous money\nAnd she hasn't really been delivering the goods and cranked up your radio Rob thanks for the call I Want to play a quickly audio before we get back to the the pipe bombs and that whole breaking story\nToday at the beginning of her Megan Kelly today show she offered up a mayor culpa or I call it a Megan ... listen [noise]\nAt the beginning of her Megan Kelly today's show she offered up a mayor culpa or I call it a Megan ... listen\nTo the show I'm Megan Kelly and I want to begin with two words I'm Sorry\nYou may have heard that yesterday we had a discussion here about political correctness and Halloween costumes and that conversation turned to whether it is ever okay for a person of one race to dress up as another a black person making their face later or a white person making there's darker\nAnd make a costume complete I defended the idea saying as long as it as it was respectful and part of a Halloween costume it seemed okay", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "24"}
