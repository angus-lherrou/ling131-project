Ramirez accusations a and we have an update on that it\nDoes not appear the FBI seems to be very interested in this sweating it she was this a third accuser and then as soon as she came out with Michael ... as her attorney as soon as she came out the story started flowing\nRegarding some of her interesting issues and there have been a serious questions about her ultimate credibility so it doesn't even appear that the FBI is a barking up the sweat Nick tree at this point so [noise]\nYou know or I think ultimately this could end up uh and it appears that you've got all these you know he said she said you have the names provided by Dr Ford from this party back in the summer of eighty two allegedly\nAnd the names that again Ford provided\nThey don't recall the incident even this so called close friend\nOf Dr Ford is a legal in Kaiser and she doesn't even recall the events but has said well I don't doubt her but I don't recall the ... well that's pretty significant let me tell you where I think\nThis is headed\nAnd you know we're hearing about these uh we get started last week there's a new name that's emerged ever get into this and just a bit there's another Yale classmate that is talking about Kavanaugh and his drinking habits are at Yale and if I were to guess at this point\nI think this investigation it's not going to find anything of an assault or sexual or attack a situation if anything it sounds like this might be heading down the path\nOf did Kavanaugh misrepresent his drinking habits and high school and\nIn college at Yale but then again you're dealing with a he said she said or he said he said well actually it'd be both because I've seen a woman come out talking about a ... drinking habits claiming that he was not truthful and then we have another not only this this roommate\nUh not not only rule a number one but there's another name that's emerged over the weekend where a another individual and we'll get into this is claiming the Kavanaugh was not truthful so again the question is\nIf he showed exemplary service and judicial intellect in the three hundred and seven opinions that he's written the the many more that he joined the majority on\nA deal hold drinking habits in high school and college deal hold that against someone in their adult life\nI mean people do there is an immaturity went what am I say about the male brain\nI I don't remember exactly but but it's something like the male brain does not fully developed\nUntil the mid to late twenties like out of the twenty I've read studies on this it's like twenty six or twenty seven years old somewhere in that ballpark that the male brain does not actually\nA fully form at least in the handling of decision making\n'em you know if if someone in the part of the brain and to to put this in layman's terms that the male brain it's it's mid twenties or so a little later or at\nThe point where the male brain really has come to grips with what's right what's wrong and making them\nPleasure and I look back at some of the stupid decisions that I made my friends made in in high school nothing approaching these allegations but there was a there was a van incident on Shore Drive in Virginia Beach circa Nineteen eighty two which [laughter]\nSame timeframe but you know what I'm a great because I'm gonna tell my story next hang on national minutes\nYeah [laughter] the latest on the news is on forty hey hey accent\nBut no thanks a lot to get excited about it back but most facts cats it'd be twenty percent parts and accessories that's twenty percent outbreak past twenty percent off oil builders twenty percent off virtually anything\nYou can fit inside the Ninety nine cent never reusable bag so tell your buddies there's a bag they just have to check out quality parts couple people that snapping that well\nYou know participate in up out of our stores last was last minimum ... which is the play offs for instance thirty one Eighteen she's in the midst of ... [noise]\nFolks with out the agreement\nOur souls Thursday and friday with without the agreement that uh well actually was friday it was friday because of the uh the vote a and and we spent a lot of time on this on friday and I said with out this concession that Kavanaugh would be\nAnd I I I got into an argument with a couple of callers because it just comes down to the mathematics that with out vis FBI investigation is if you want to call it a concession without this\nCabin all would have been toes so I had a couple of people call the show is like I should add your caving in you're giving in they just need to have a vote\nWhat part of yeah OK ram and bulldoze vote you're not going to have enough votes in the full Senate well first of all flank probably without this compromise for the week long FBI investigation slate\nWould've been a no so flank was yes to get cabin on out of committee and of course totally split the eleven yes on the Republican side to know exactly what we expected whatever\nOr whatever the circumstances whether it's really the way this cookie was going to crumble but flake has said without the FBI investigation or that he'd be a no vote\nObviously and with a voting for this to get out of committee that that flake would would if nothing turns up here the flake would be a yes vote or when it comes down to the full Senate vote for confirmation but the issue is you would have lost Susan Collins you would have lost Murkowski\nThe a ... a a Democrats potentially a that would vote for cabinet you would have lost them so you wouldn't have had those votes the joint mansions or the Heidi Heitkamp you would not Donnelly you would not have had those votes to take up the slack\nOf losing flake losing columns losing Murkowski on the Republican side so anyone that wants to just you know ... view or\nTalk radio theater and rhetoric oh they should have held their ground they should have voted right then and then that\nThat is great you could play on the game you want but when it comes down to what you want to see Kavanaugh\nConfirmed and he would not have had the votes is simple mathematics here it doesn't get any easier than less harsh mad where's your back for someone to call up and say you're you're all wrong ... they need to vote and get get capital\nWhat don't you get they would not have had the votes that is the point I'm trying to make\nSo I I even label flake as the potential savior and this is where it gets politically interesting\nThat it turns out that flake with this demand\nAnd it looks like that he came very loaded with a Collins over on on the um or or or um or is that my democratic friends a I'm a ... or ... whatever his name as I'm On a ... a Coons Chris foods\nAre so it looks like all he caught with Chris Coons a Democrat on the Senate Judiciary committee\nThe fact is you could look if you look to you like he was a caving in and he's a flake is really the closet Democrats the fact is is that by by striking this deal with Chris who's\nOver on the Democratic side this ultimately could be the saving grace for Brett Kavanaugh because otherwise it would have been complete toast\nBack to square one\nA new nominee for the Supreme Court for President Trump\nSo capital might be saved by this flights and ultimately there's this Chris Coons he's a senator from Delaware on the Senate Judiciary in that little a ploy that we saw on friday\nSo I mean I don't know why people don't understand that this was the only shot\nThat this potentially could have gone there is not there is not\nA let's grab a couple of your phone calls here and then I Want to get a little deeper into the investigation and what we know so far are regarding Ramirez and Dr Ford et cetera or the Democrats demanding a I Believe is a list\nOf a couple of dozen additional uh interviewee is that the Democrats want to see the FBI interview so we'll see a back to the phones here uh how 'bout Diane and Ontario, California Dianne your first stop today on ... welcome to the program\nYes Hi I'm I've been watching this um whatever the current trial that ah the point I Would like to make\nThat leap Glenn Kaiser does not know Brett Kavanaugh and was not ever at a party with worm with or without Christine that's all the proof we need my confirmed with the FBI investigation is that somebody\nAh regarding the unnamed boy gonna come out of the woodwork and say you remember everything that may not turn out well for ... and the old saying goes even allowed to flourish went good men do not think\nWell they are I think that the ... story I think that carries a lot of weight\nYes or you know she is on the fence ear because she's saying that she didn't know Kavanaugh did not recall this party which\nUh I agree yeah this is is is very very significant but then she says well I don't doubt my friend or ... or ... by that I guess she was Christine blindly you know for her to say\nAh that has no recollection but I don't doubt it are those to me are very contradictory as you can imagine how does the word\nNonsense that three ... thanks for the call appreciate it let's go to Maryland and ...\nIs in Maryland on Iran Schmidt welcome to the program\nThank you so I just want to say thank you I Love listening to your program\nUm and I had been listening for the last hour and I just think you're right spot on everything he said however I don't have the Democrats could do this to this gentleman is kind of intelligent\nJudge how could they do is to his family and ruined his life\nWhy they don't because they don't care if it's all about what they care\nBecause come on as well as an honor its about by the way do you honor or is it Anna Anna\nOkay I I Know I Know some of the pronounce it on and so I'm Sorry enter yes and he gets out here and you've been around a while I guess and somebody should understand that for the Democrats here it's all about preventing Kavanaugh's preventing this Trump pick\nIs prevent its it's taking the the Kennedy's swing vote and putting it into the hands of a reliable conservative vote not a swing\nAnd that's what the Democrats have vowed at\nAll costs to stop this truck nomination\nAnd they will ruin lives they don't care so for you to say it was I'm not yelling you I'm just trying to I'm just trying to get it no rafters leader they added they'll they'll do whatever it takes they don't care

Iran Schmidt welcome thanks\nHey shit I Love I Love your show every afternoon well ... but but here it's like saying that\nYou know it was sexual assault and she was at rates are nothing I'm not condoning sexual assault any any way shape or form but my problem is that she she doesn't care that he's a women's basketball you know coach or you know he's got all that stuff or women and work with women\nAnd she knew you know he worked during the Bush administration but it's like why is it a problem with her suppose that allegation like why is she coming up for it now when he might become the Supreme Court judge that's my problem\nWell certainly the ... the timing of suspected she must have known about his rise in\nHorrible then right you shouldn't have said something before you became a couch I'm a woman ...\nWell it it's not just that listen I don't know if she knew she being out in California and and the capital of being in Maryland friends I don't know I don't know if she knew that he was a a ... a girl's basketball coach but certainly his rise through the the federal judicial system\nAnd the the work working in the Bush administration appointed to the federal bench by my uh George W. Bush a for instance\nI listen I I'm sure she was aware of it but you know her claim is now that he's up for the highest court in the land and the the the that's why a lot of people just don't buy her story\nAgain you know and the ... you know being that the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land you're you're on that court for the rest of your life\nThat's used for coming forward but again the timing is ridiculously suspect here and I I don't condone and I I Am appalled by any kind of sexual abuse sexual assault\nBut again it just doesn't add up the character even if he was a sloppy drinkers or in high school or in college it just doesn't\nThanks for the call I appreciate it when we get back this tweet again\nA from a woman you got to hear what this woman who claims and she's a writer and she's verify it on Twitter you're not going to believe what she tweeted out a couple of days ago and then also the lugging tense situation with Kevin ... next shoe\nOnly have a sense he knew that the interesting things on a new song eight forty hey M.

Christine Tell us about them\nSo this is a a snarky tweet from another female\nWent to school with Christine Blasey Ford at the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill [noise] who appears to be calling her out that she was no angel it seems\nAt the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill [noise] who appears to be calling her out that she was no angel it seems back\nIn Nineteen eighty eight them prior wall they weren't college now that has been retweeted thirty four thousand times it's been commented on Seventeen thousand times it has been light fifty eight thousand times\nAnd then as I scroll up and I look at these other tweets from this D.C McAllister\n\nI Want to know about Christine's high school and college years we've unpack Kavanaugh's from high school and college how bout of hers if characters on the line in his he said she said circus let's expose every ones and there are she tweets a lot this D.C McAllister\nAnd again I I Can't even read all these tweets just ask them questions is someone who was at you and see if the same time she referenced the difficulty of college just want to know if she engaged in any questionable behavior while there many girls did we've ruled Brett her turn\nSo this woman is going after\nDr Ford\nAnd then she was questioned about the you know the woman or a woman can party drink a lot hook up with whoever she wants to be sexually assaulted you absolute dumb ass that was somebody responding to her tweet she responds\nAbsolutely not were absolutely but character and temperament matter when it comes to the truth especially with no evidence rights or no and again I scroll through a tweet something there are there's like a since since that tweet on Saturday there's like a hundred tweets on here\nI mean I don't know how she has this much your time to tweet us ... a writer I guess uh\nIf anything happened to Ford and that's a big if it seems it's more likely to happen in college with no cabin on not in high school so she's suggesting\nA threat from a friend of mine professor Cleveland\nAnd this professor at Cleveland let me see if I can figure out what a conservative Catholic locker twenty five years Seventh Circuit judge it an adjunct professor Notre Dame lawyer CPA so here's Margot Cleveland a friend of this\nThis D.C McAllister and she uh tweeted let me ask you something of a woman came forward and said that she was sexually assaulted in the summer of Nineteen eighty two and she was Fifteen\nBy one boy with a second in the room egging Iran and to corroborate her claim she pointed to small portions of notes from therapists\nAnd then you know she goes on a and continues or tweet in multiple with but the point is again a lot of women are doubting the story here\nA lot of women and again I'm scrolling now like dozens of additional tweets here from this this D.C McAllister she's a contributing writer to PJ Media\nOr the federalist a co author of Spygate and she has a home base apparently of Charlotte North Carolina but she she's a columnist with the Jamie\nWhich you know I think the Jamie does a very good conservative website is we noticed pajamas maybe it's not PJ Media and I I think they do a very good job and I've read their material for years\nYou know here we have another example of a a woman that's calling out Dr Ford and we're an eight hundred and again I'd love to hear from the opposing view I mean we take all calls it has been nearly impossible to get a woman to call\nAnd again I'd love to hear from the opposing view I mean we take all calls it has been nearly impossible\nTo get a woman to call this program that thinks that that Kavanaugh is the devil and that this Dr Ford is telling the absolute truth it has been nearly impossible for me to get phone calls in support of Dr Ford\nOr in the fact that it was cabin on Kavanaugh is the absolute devil or some of the women that are called and said yeah we think something happened but it wasn't capital\nIf you'd like to jump on folks it's eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine nationwide number eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine so we have the loving to an affair ... situation\nWho the heck is this well it's Chad Chad ordering to\nAnd it turns out that a guy that attempt at Yale University here's this is a different man than the roommates of Kavanaugh's apparently there were some bad blood there there was a it might have been there might have been a in a in a a triple a with three roommates\nAnd\nYou have cabinet whose alluded to the fact that uh one of the accusers uh that we talked about last week that all he wasn't truthful with his drinking that he was sloppy drunk he drank a lot he was belligerent so we've heard this now from a a woman she was on CNN we've heard it from the the first roommate and now we have this Chad loving to\nAnd this is from an interview with the New York times so this guy who was at Yale with Brett Kavanaugh\nHe spoke to the New York times on Sunday and he is accusing Kavanaugh of not being truthful about his alcohol usage his drinking\nAs it was discussed at the Senate Judiciary committee hearing on Thursday so\nIt's ... gave an interview to the New York times and he said that he saw cabinet are staggering from alcohol consumption\nOn multiple occasions describing him as again belligerent and aggressive now this is to my knowledge or at least that this is what I recollect there are three people now from Gail\nDays that are calling him aggressive and belligerent when he drinks [noise] language you know being used the same with three and that does that sound\nA little contrived as it sounds a little too in concert ... to me of Dutch all using the same exact language here\nIt is true that is at stake he says is calling from New York Times it is true that is at stake and I believe the ability to speak the truth even when it does not reflect well upon oneself is a paramount quality we seek in our nation's most powerful judges\nThat was a statements according to the New York times\nNow they also do point out and good for the times that this loving ten has made the\nPolitical contributions are contributions to Democrats over the years they categorize these donations as small in in uh in stature about you know I I don't see the actual number here but that he's made some small political donations to Democrats over the years\nLonger than seven Kavanaugh\nWhen he watched the hearing on Thursday that he seemed to dance\nIt's over the years loving considered Kavanaugh\nWhen he watched the hearing on Thursday that he seemed to downplay his drinking\nAnd the quote degree and frequency of his alcohol consumption that is what he told the times and the FBI has asked him to share his story at the FBI bureau headquarters a field office in Raleigh North Carolina\nSo loving to him apparently is going to speak with the FBI so he is going to be a apparently one of the ones interviewed a regarding\nThis this drinking so if he if he's correct or he told the times that he's supposed to ... a share his story with the FBI in Raleigh today\nIn ... in Raleigh North Carolina so it might have already happened it might be occurring right now\nAnd then of course we have these other classmates that have also come out and said that oh he's not telling the truth about his drinking and again I just find a lot of this attack just completely suspect then again I\nI mean these individuals must have known about his rise his time in the Bush administration in multiple positions\nIn including handling some of the most sensitive material uh before George W. Bush it\nTo me it it just doesn't make sense and then we have this this woman that I saw on CNN she was you know talking about his drinking as well eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number here on Schmidt that's how you get on eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nNow from the President Trump pressure from earlier today\nThis was in the rose garden this was essentially dealing with the new deal\nOr regarding the agreement we've come to trade with Canada and of course the Mexico arrangement so the president's earlier today and the rose garden of course this all morphed into the cabinet discussion to me the best audio bites\nTo merge\nI have queued up and I want to play for your next now I also in our number one\nI played the audio bite of Trump saying that hey on the Democratic side\nI he was alluding to or somebody with big problems with alcohol or a sloppy drunk on the Democratic side\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are an arrow radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone now\nFor anywhere [noise]\n[noise] hey Sean Spicer and every mid term election since the civil war the president's party has lost an average of thirty two seats in the house of representatives and two in the Senate We're in for what will be a wild political season and they're going to be plenty to discuss and debate and dissect\nShe'll be sure to download my new podcast everything's going to be All right beginning in October ... election I was an hour long weekly political pod cast covering the very latest news across the country and we provide listeners with unique inside and you can't get anywhere else everything's going to be All right and subscribe and download today on radio dot com and I too\nFrom the justice of ... home loans studios today at twenty am north Las Vegas ...

of the nuggets along the way I Want to get into a little more detail the specificity of I'll do that here moments\nIn the one thing and I might do it slowly for those that don't get it or can't get it through their thick freaking not good news is that if you don't have flight Collins and Murkowski\nSo flake\nHe is the retiring exiting senator from Arizona Lisa Murkowski from Alaska and Senator

it was on ... you know when she opens her mouth and was not what I expected\nI don't know if that's her normal speaking voice I you know what she coached I Do believe she was Thomas ah but as far as reading prepared remarks I think there are times where you know what you have written and that you could come off script\nAnd be oh come across as a little more um a intimate or come across as a little more engaged but again she says she's not a pro so I I Will give her the benefit of that out but you raise a lot of questions Thomas which I think are fair\nAnd not what do you think about Canada\nI I think that a judicial you look at his history and it just it doesn't lend itself\nTo these accusations now might have been drunk or drinking a little bit in high school and college or maybe a lot of bits in high school and college but that doesn't turn you into a rapist is is the bottom line here it it doesn't\nHave what they were your pressure this temperament I was not I was not impressed with the behavior\nOf I liked I liked the way he came out swinging in his opening statement by appearing to defend his honor and the accusations I thought no Thomas you're correct there were a couple of times during the hearing where a temperament\nI think he was trying a little bit too hard because there were reports also the Trump was not happy that he was in forceful enough during his regular or questioning during the regular hearings the week prior there were reports that President Trump thought that he could have been a little more aggressive and tougher\nAnd and this is according to a ... interview on Fox ah and I think that maybe Kevin always try to compensate\nOr a little bit for the fact that Trump wanted him to turn up the Jews but\nIt's not just that Thomas I think also he has been stung he has been hurt he has been crushed his family's been dragged through the mud so I think it was a combination of Trump wanted to see him a more a in a in a protagonist position\nAs well as I think he's deeply\nAre hurt and I think he was deeply showing emotion so I think that some of the temperament issues I don't think he has a temperament issue I think that there were a couple of incidents or last week on Thursday where it came off because I think he was being a little or maybe a little hyped up at aggressive just in that particular scenario\nWhen our shores and worry that yeah if you don't mind yeah I'm sure no judge\nBe nonpartisan should never ... he was he started railing about the the Clintons and all this where did you expect somebody sitting in that position to be nonpartisan\nThey should be and that's an area I don't think that I got plenty of who's with the Clintons I'll talk about them all day long and he brought the Clintons\nProbably not but again I think he's all for qualified for this gig\nI he deserves this gig his ratings from a BA or through the roof and conversely the a BA is now you know said\nThat hey he he needs to their needs to be an FBI investigation so a lot of folks that have come to his defense have also said hey there needs to be this FBI investigation as I pointed out flake might have provided the only lifeline that Kavanaugh has\nAt this juncture in time Thomas thanks for the call I appreciate it\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine phones are loaded you have a lot to say if you're

I heard that part and yeah yeah she she on Saturday but I Do something like this on Twitter on friday actually\nYeah but the point is is she claims D.C McAllister who writes for PJ Media\nAnd she's a conservative writer again this is a woman she on Saturday put out a tweet\nAnd the relevance here is the fact that she claims that she went to University of North Carolina Chapel Hill with Christine Blasey Ford the capital accuses she's claiming that she was there\nAnd she uh offered up this this question regarding her character and\nFor those that are didn't hear this this D.C McAllister we put the tweet up on the ... so it's on ... list ... showed dot com but you know she uh put out this tweet on Saturday that says Christine ... Ford was a classmate of mine\nYou know she uh put out this tweet on Saturday that says Christine Blasey Ford\nWas a classmate of mine and UNC we graduated in Nineteen eighty eight I Want to ask Christine if she remembers party at trolls drinking it he's not here\nHooking up with guys it hinders in St eating a timeout remember those days Christine Tell us about them so clearly this D.C McAllister is being snarky and the delivery and suggesting that\nUh maybe Christine Blasey Ford and her history is not all Snow White and ... and daisies et cetera and again I think she's coming from the standpoint that you have a cabin on it's been accused of all kinds of horrific actions here\nAnd she's suggesting listen what's fair is fair let's talk about the history in the background of the accuser and this is from a female perspective who is claiming to our knowledge about her behavior back you'd UNC in Nineteen eighty eight in North Carolina\nAbsolutely and the cross examination was a\nVery light and nobody pushed her on the issues and I thought that kind of odd I mean if she was to take this to court it would be a very harshly throw a push back and they would cross examined her character not one person who did that during the Senate confirmation\nWell again you have to be careful of optics and you know and that's the reason why\nI'm looking at are you guys hear your girl you weren't we're not going to bring the optics outlet that come out in the FBI investigation well I think it's actually a smart move in a pun intended it might be their Trump\nCard well Jason it's just the fact that they brought in the female or six times crimes prosecutor from ah Arizona to handle the Republican questioning because of the optics of you know eleven white guys you know quizzing or Dr Ford and that was you know also part of the optics there and in fact\nUh this is also getting plenty of play over the weekend in that the prosecutor\nVis a vis a woman I'm Rachel Mitchell was her name she has said that the burden of proof just would not rise to the level of a a prosecution that with what information she sees as a prosecutor\nThat she could not bring a case so the woman the woman who questioned the Ford for the Republicans a will respect in sex crimes prosecutor for Maricopa County Arizona\nIn the Phoenix area so that was what we have here there's no way that I could even prosecuted crime here that I wouldn't even move forward and of course the Democrats are now attacking her saying oh she's a partisan she's a registered Republican and\nThat lesson I don't think that you would compromise her integrity and again and her Seavey on her background speaks for itself thanks for the call Jason appreciate it from Las Vegas Nevada let's go to North Carolina\nJoe is in Charlotte Joe you're on Schmidt\nHi Hi how are you doing tonight doing fine go ahead I'm just so sick\nAnd tired of the Hollywood liberal activists being the moral authority on the situation I mean Hollywood\nIs is that sets pool of that license women for for you even marijuana one road commented how it was a giant for awful\nAnd they're and they're sitting there just covered up and buried it never talked about you mean to tell me when Democrats take money hand over fist from Hollywood they knew Weinstein wasn't raping young starving actresses\nAnd and they're taking money from I'm not reporting it won't report it or current Saturday Night live won't even ... protecting them\nSince ... and they're taking money from I'm not reporting it won't report it or current Saturday Night live won't even spoof it protecting them I mean give me a break to my knowledge church Rosemarie\nGarland never found a job since you use Harvey Weinstein or raping her\nI don't think so I could be wrong there it's a joke and they're going to tell and they're going to judge Brett Kavanaugh all these people who let these things go on and on and on and look you know what people are really will start for like almost from all around them\nBecause you cannot tell me she was a child actors beautiful girl you're not tell me she was not violated at the hand of a Hollywood moguls and cannot say a word about it or her career would be over the only power she\nHas is to attack Brett Kavanaugh for cheese helpless she's that that don't seem to Hollywood it if she\nSigned out her abuser she never work again and it's at this couple sets pool\nAnd they're allowed to run their mouth and run their TV shows and I had a Republican and no pushback not in the media not anywhere it's ... it's all part of our country I think we should\nChop off that portrayed setting the\nPacific Ocean [laughter] suffered brown still\nWell the hypocrisy obviously has been raging for many many years\nAnd do as I say not as I Do try to act is moral compasses in moral authorities while you know some of the material they are obviously a Porsche out you know illicit gun control you know they're the push for guns well there's lots of violent Hollywood movies\nAnd it's again it's do as I say not as I Do and that has been unbelievably uh\nUh the hypocrisy has been studying for many many years there and then again with the me too movement\nAnd I'm sure many further their careers and they shouldn't speak out and I don't think all have and you know you saw less mulatto obviously at the Capitol hearing a you know almost trying too hard to be seen and and if she saw that maybe she was being covered up on the monitor that must have been visible she was moving\nShe could be seen thanks for the call John appreciate it I I appreciate your passion and yeah I I don't think anyone is disputing the Hollywood hypocrisy speaking of that or if you watch Saturday Night live what is my position on the Saturday Night live opening with Matt Damon\nThe surprise Matt Damon playing Kavanaugh on Saturday Night I Do have some thoughts on that we'll get to that coming up and also I'm Matt Damon in the past\nWhen he was accused or looking the other way at all part of me to move but this was last fall member Matt Damon a God embroiled in a couple of issues Matt Damon he came out swinging\nSaying that he was going to defend his honors I Want to talk about SNL and then Matt Damon less than a year ago and maybe he has a short memory first though we're sort of this this is just agree just disgusting\nA Georgetown professor says that white two Republican senators quote deserve miserable deaths after the cabin on hearing\nReally\nI Wonder if a Georgetown University in Washington if there is only to act\nOn this professors thoughts this was an anti Trump professor at Georgetown University is saying that white Republican senators who were a part of the cabin on hearing should be castrated and in door a miserable death\nIt was who were a part of the Capitol hearing should be castrated adding door a miserable death\nWho's this Dr Carroll Christine fair who is an associate professor this is in the security studies program at Georgetown\nTalked about white Republican senators including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina\nWho remember we played the audio of Lindsey Graham and his heroic all those a few good men kind of moment said that uh Lindsey Graham especially deserve miserable deaths", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "01"}
