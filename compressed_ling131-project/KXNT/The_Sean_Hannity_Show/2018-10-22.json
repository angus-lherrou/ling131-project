[noise]\nAh the the thing is crawling with ISIS folks that al ... there's no I'm kidding\nIs caravan of ... [noise] ah the the thing is crawling with ISIS folks that al ... there's no I'm kidding I\nHopefully no one just turned off the radio the TV I'm kidding around\nI I have not seen any proof that there are Middle Eastern infiltrators however I Will say so I'm not jumping on board and say oh Trump is right and there's there's no substantiate and there's no proof of that and I do\nUnderstand the porous nature of the southern border after nine eleven it was always a concern about infiltrators or terrorists from the middle east\nOr ISIS or al ... sympathizers or operatives\nComing into the United states through our porous borders and that certainly is a concern I might discounting that it's a possibility but I just haven't seen any specific evidence to prove that we have middle Easterners or a bad\nActors from the middle East that might have I entered these caravans I Will say though that I Would be concerned I Would certainly uh try to a\nPost intel or gather in tell from the field to find out if that's accurate\nOr there's been no proof offered by the president\nOr for his statement but it's certainly wouldn't be\nIt wouldn't be a potential vehicle\nFor bad actors to get into the United states to embed themselves and and huddled inside these caravans or to try to get into the United states I just haven't seen anything to suggest that that that actually is happening here why so the tweets and I have these ah right here\nAnd again there's no end in between so there's no evidence or really any ration now for the middle Easterner allegation\nSo unless I'm giving you intellectual honesty here are on ... that's what I Do is the world according to ... a thirty seven am this morning President Trump tweeted\nSadly it looks like Mexico's police and military are unable to stop the caravan heading to the southern border of the United states criminals and unknown middle Easterners are mixed in\nI have alerted border patrol and military that this is a national emergency must change laws I agree we must change laws\nAnd the president has the right to declare an emergency\nOr if he thinks that our safety is at risk here but as far as a unknown middle Easterners mix them haven't seen any proof I'd like to see proof certainly a possibility but there's nothing that absolutely confirms that now as far as criminals\nI Would guess the the vast majority of these ... are not criminals but I'm sure that there is some bad element that's mix them\nMaybe some as to who knows\nA ... ... it doesn't justify the fact they want to Boston to the country that is illegal that would make them a criminal [laughter]\n[laughter] you know and most of these individual I think the only crime they probably would commit would be trying to enter the United states illegally but I'm not discounting the fact that there's there's a you know no opportunity for bad actors to a embed themselves or join a caravan\nTo try to get into the United states so that was a a thirty seven then about ten minutes later at age forty nine AM\nThe president tweeted every time you see a caravan or people illegally coming or attempting to come into our country illegally\nThink of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes to change our pathetic immigration laws\nAnd he really think of and blamed the Democrats for not giving us the votes\nTo change our pathetic immigration laws exclamation point remember the midterms so on it's so unfair to those who come in legally and that's true that's a hundred percent right I agree with the president on that\nAnd the Democrats have been obstructionists when it comes to a proper or immigration reform and immigration laws in this country\nAnd plus it's clearly a wedge issue this is clearly a mid term issue and I don't blame the president for also using that to try to gin up support\nAnd to make people more alert aware make them angry to try to assist the Republicans in the mid term elections and then finally hear another ten minutes later a fifty seven am this morning\nThe president tweeted Guatemala Honduras and El Salvador were not able to do the job of stopping people from leaving their country and coming illegally to the U.S\nWe will now begin cutting off\nOr substantially reducing the massive foreign aid routinely given to them\nHey up right up I I fully support them or nobody knows essentially the basis uh regarding the middle eastern or claim a but the point and you know the tweet you know came after\nThere was a guest on Fox and friends who floated the idea of ISIS fighters\nAre joining a the caravan to try to get into the United states so as the president like Fox and friends and now he he's been ... some of the subject matter after it airs but again I Love to

local dodge dealer\n[laughter] them ... there's no there's no official sponsorship but every time I hear a caravan I'm thinking about the the dodge caravan I Wonder if any any dodge dealers or any Chrysler and dodge around the country if they're doing any caravan promotions\nHey with all the caravans of the news hey we've got a whole lot full of caravans to clear up we've got more caravans on the lot them caravan is coming up from Mexico some come on down and get a great deal on a dodge caravan the kids love it yeah you got the the headphone Jack on the TV sets the come down from the

cram into a dodge caravan\n[laughter] got to do a contest\nHow many my guess how many migrants are crammed them and and when you know like how many jelly beans or how many how many ... jar or whatever I say here's here's the latest your Daily Caller is reporting\nWithout no middle Easterners but the Daily Caller is reporting\nThat some Bangladeshis haven't joined the migrant caravan [noise]\nThis is according to a Univision or you live on a on a busy on a Univision correspond let me read some of this Daily Caller piece a Spanish language reporter was spent weeks and better with the migrant caravan said that ...\nThe spawn let me read some of this Daily Caller piece a Spanish language reporter was spent weeks them better with the migrant caravan said that people from Bangladesh should joined the mass of people are so uh I don't see any middle Easterners and again I haven't seen any substantiate Asian or for that\nBut apparently there's at least the one guy from Bangladesh who's jumped into the caravan\nBut mostly Hondurans\nBangladesh you know does have a large Muslim population a but again I I don't I don't consider Bangladesh a you know that's what south east Asia and not the not the middle east per se so\nRight or just wrapping up with the care of and I got to move on to Jared Kushner the show the mess I mean folks the Saudis stories here are it's laughable it's like the Saudi comedy hour\nWith the stories and the evolution and the the ... the chameleon like changes here on the story and to take it it's a joke and then the body doubles story is crazy is\nWrapping up on the caravan\nI agree with the president and the threats that he's made to Guatemala Honduras El Salvador about eight and hey control your people stop them\nOr else are we going to squeeze us I've got no issue with that I Would support the president a hundred percent now this is the second time according to my count that Trump has threatened to cut off you know eight or money to these countries if they don't stop\nThere are all citizens from making a run for the border\nBut it's unclear if the president's gonna take unilateral action through executive order because Congress has not scheduled to return to DC until\nAfter the midterm elections you know also you know the chatter of a middle class tax cut to a new wave new round of tax cuts for middle class that was obviously I I Would like to see I'd love to see that\nBut I also be remiss if it's a mid term election little boy kind of fire up the and bring some good favor the Republicans sums are about ... you can announce a proposals for a comment but there's not going to be any cutter any congressional vote on any caught\nUntil after Congress gets back obviously I'm\nYou know I I like the president to spell out a little more clearly what he wants to El Salvador Honduras Guatemala to do and I that's what I can obviously you know and a bunch of things to the list but I'd like to see some specific I mean it goes beyond just have stopped them\nOr the president who make demands on specific actions that he would like these governments to actually take now most of the countries\nDo not have laws to prevent people from leaving I mean these are free countries they can come and go but the horns and masses in throngs of people who've announced that they're joining a caravan\nTo break into the United states or the governments need to do obviously more\nMember on\nWe have the story that initially they were blocked\nFrom crossing that bridge into Mexico so yeah they repelled by Mexican authorities Mexican police I think the military the federal rallies and then the caravan was able to bust through they they crossed into Mexico a lot of them over the weekend\nTo continue this a trip through Mexico to the U.S border so again\nAnd so they're held those so somewhere in that in that range you know at first\nYou know groups of women and the children that were allowed to cross from Guatemala and Mexico for processing there but uh many of the others that eventually follow them so if President Trump cruelly\nLiterally declared a national emergency that would unleash a whole host of additional essence but at this point it is unclear whether that's an actual declaration or just rhetoric or the president angry as I Am\nAnd if we need to protect the borders to prevent the onslaught of Seventy five hundred hey let's let's see another thing that I I'm not no issue with the declaration of a national emergency and I would support the president\nIn that declaration for preventing Seventy five hundred people or so from busting into the United states so I I Would give a thumbs up on that\nYou know last week the president warned that he may take military action if the onslaught doesn't stop on\nA so far the Pentagon incidentally the Pentagon says that has not been requested to provide any additional support\nAt the border or even after the president's tweets from this morning so less than the president has a a wide uh ability for executive order and so I have to wait and see exactly what the president of the sides to do here we had a\nCharity cushion or\nThe cluster so the latest on your mouth to show the here Jared Kushner was believe it or not and this is incredible Jared Kushner was at\nA political event this CNN citizen event uh being hosted or moderated or being interviewed by none other than Van Jones\nI got again I'm not a huge Jared Kushner fan I'm not a fan of or even the appearance of any nepotism the behavior in of all good Trump and Jared the son in law as a senior advisor I'll

Abdel Abd El Al Jubeir talking about ... to show gay and he was on with Brett Baer on Fox\nNews Sunday or was it Fox News Sunday yesterday it was that was Bret Baer um was oh this was a media buzz on Sunday so Bret Baer a\nDid this interview or with a Dell algebra less of the some of this I thought it was boxers another Chris Wallace was on that and that this was a special on the er the media buzz with Howard Kurtz\nWe had a a vigil who came to the conflict he was approached by members of the some of these security team he they told us that he left the conflict they came back was hungry that's how they report says that this that we can sort of a totally must have visited\nThey have they told us that he left the conflict they can represent have is how they report to that the sec [noise] the ... the totally must have some eminent as he describes the team to investigate in Turkey was a Turkish authorities reports who are against him from turkey does not come forth with reports that have provided to show all your turn to Saudi Arabia [noise]\nSee paying them at their activity a public prosecutors to launch the investigation which he did about nine days ago he discovered that there were discrepancies for discovered this or he was killed in the conflict we don't know seep in terms of details how we don't know where the body is to be public prosecutors and of\nCourse the Saudis they didn't come clean from the beginning of their standing behind all once we investigate it and we found out that these are these rogue operators so ... from gave us a preview when he talked about real killers 'cause that's what a clearly the Saudis had told President Trump or I told my palm pay\nAnd I mean really that's that's the story they gonna stick with here just ridiculously bogus and it's been all over the road or from the fist fight then you know he was he was choked out ah things went wrong I mean come on\nAnd to say that you know they they brought this forensic doc allegedly a bone saw uh the body double or the the glue on beard I really\nAll of that just all coincidental at things went bad folks this was a hit this was ordered by\nThe crown prince by this Mohammed bin ... or ... ... then Selma he ordered this hits and he is being caught in the worst possible fashion\nOr a foot down to ... to detain Eighteen individuals for questioning and possibly facing trial\nSo they are Eighteen individuals that can be detained you're among you know the members of that Fifteen member hit squad so ah are they going to take off all for the kingdom or is it going to be something you know ramshackle a kangaroo court they found yeah and then they're really this is put on a show\nI guess they were acting they're acting on the orders of NBS there's no doubt about it\nThough not to my mind\nAre they going to put on this show right or are they going to really have a serious fall guys whose lives are done because they were following orders and about the whole story just unwrap I said this guy is just another create this Abd El Al Jubeir the Saudi Arabian foreign minister you know with his uh ...\nTend to the king also dismissed the number of senior officials in this area this threat is to be the first step is a long journey so we are determined to uncover every stone\nAnd all I'm sure you are well guess what the biggest stone to uncover is the complicit in the complicity behavior of the crown prince of Mohammed bin ... I don't know if I don't think he knew about this\nBecause the crown prince orders so and you know he stepped on people's faces he's stepped on other royal family members to get the crown prince position that he has\nSo I'm sure there are others in the royal family love love to see him go down\nSo it was the the king the king or might not even know what month for him he might not even know what you're wearing\nA lot of I don't think he's a really involved in in much of this have Newt Gingrich\nOn Fox News Sunday from\nFirst of all their their explanations insulted me ... yeah I mean the idea that this guy walking around with Fifteen security people got in a fight and it was actually killed when that happened to have found in the December him and get rid of\nI mean the idea that this guy walked in the room with Fifteen security people got in a fight and it was actually killed when that happened to have found inability to December him and get rid of him that happened to me that if this is a stupid so why is the president saying that's part of all the president is trying to walk a tightrope between I think it's a big problem", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "22"}
