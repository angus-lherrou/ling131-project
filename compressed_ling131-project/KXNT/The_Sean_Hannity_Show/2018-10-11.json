I Would\nNote is that I think the Kanye West situation with a visit to the white I probably could have had greater effect if it weren't this close to the aftermath of Michael ah like President Trump\nPennsylvania last night for a rally and we told you all about this we told you that the president was going to get a ration of you know what a for a media outlets\nAnd of course uh it it happened on on the cable lose a fair last night on some of the channels are criticizing the president you know how do I yeah I don't want to come across in across his criticizing the president but doesn't the optics you know going to a campaign style rally when you have all this devastation in Florida\nI was I I I I'm thinking of the timing\nI could've been a little better and I told you the president tweeted out that there were thousands of people that were going to be disappointed if he didn't show up and stuff happens and natural disasters happen and you're reschedule I just think that the ... by rescheduling and not doing a rally last night I it takes\nIt takes the ammunition away from the critics\nAnd I think it would have been a well placed decision to to move the rally and then with Tonya a while he has a lot of good points to make you know I mean will it get news coverage yes\nIt's already gone to cable news coverage today or will it get nightly news coverage yeah but for a real from I'm\nA\nFirst to firmly seep in I guess is the way I Want to put it for for Kanye is one of his dry visit and trying to reduce crime and murders and bring jobs back to America and talking about prison reform\nHunger is points that they could have had much greater impact if you just got a little bit away from the big national does a national story of the natural disaster in Florida just a recommendation ah before I play some of the Kanye audio the update is in\nAnd now the death toll which was at\nTo the death toll now stands at five\nWhich I'm sure it's going to go up an addict Gadsden County Florida and W T XL they're reporting the Gadsden county sheriff's office has confirmed that for people have\nDied due to hurricane Michael and related incidents\nOr the sheriff's office in front of the two people died in Greensboro one died in ...\nAnd another died in Quincy in Florida they confirmed that a Greensboro man died after a tree fell on his home yesterday and we we had heard about that we have that on during the program\nAh they haven't really studied the details surrounding the deaths of the other three people but what we had heard a we have the free that fell and there was also an eleven year old girl\nA was killed as well uh apparently a a a leg\nOf a car for in a metal um support leg somehow became a torn apart and became a projectile so are the numbers we're having now it's a it looks like five people are are are confirmed dead my biggest concern before we play the Kanye West audio with President Trump\nThe the the biggest the biggest concern I have is that the mayor of Mexico beach they've got hit the hardest said that by his account about two hundred eighty people decided to stay and ride it out and we just don't know the fate of all of those two hundred eighty people\nI'm just hoping that there is not a a massive climb in a\nIn the death toll here so hopefully it will be kept to a minimum on\nOn to the Kanye West audio and I'll play a few excerpts here uh [laughter] it's just you know kind of all over the road I've you know kind of like a little Trump rallies [laughter]\nIn the oval office today with Kanye West and I've got a an extended here will grab some phone calls phone calls rolling in eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine gets you on eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine\nLebanon rule ah this first clip here and I'll I'll starting and stopping in interject a few of my thoughts uh regarding what town you said earlier today in the oval office\nYou know the scary to not have my own friends\nBut it's half hour away\nSo he's talking about the red make America great again hats and that caused a little bit of her sister and a ruckus when he was on Saturday Night live a couple of weeks ago and then he went into a speech on Saturday Night live which which we did not air\nBecause they'd already cut away and you know they roll the closing credits are made already a finished the show\nA but he gave a little speech about Trump or really just to the audience inside a studio a with a eight eight eight or whatever it is where we're Saturday Night live is a at thirty rock so that didn't get broadcast but everyone saw his make America great again hat\nAnd here he's talking about his friends or try to\nStop him from wearing the heck is if Congress wants to wear the make America great again that he has all the right to wear the hats\nAnd again he says a lot of things that make sense or even though I don't really care for Kanye West I never have and just because I like Trump's policies doesn't mean that I suddenly after my Kanye West because Kanye West a is kissing the president's bought a ... I'm I'm not\nI'm not going to suddenly like how do you want and I just I've never liked the got like so let's continue the audio but he does make sense on a number of these points here you know my dad\nAnd my mom separated and have a lot of mail energy in my home\nAnd also a I'm married to a family that um\nYou know a lot of mail energy doing all that for all we know what family you're married into a time where you know is talking\n[noise] you know I Love your everyone right\nHe said he loves Hillary I got a problem with that kind of getting worse loves Hillary [laughter]\nBut they have had her just didn't make me feel of the guys that he didn't get to see my dad all the time like a guy sacrifice was\nSo very talking about uh the um with her campaign and that didn't resonate with him or because he's the guy and\nIt was something about like put his hat off and made me feel like Superman\nThat hats the make America great again hat in the magazine that makes them feel like Superman\nWho made a Superman that was my favorite superhero [noise] and you may have Superman case for me also at the guy that looks up so you look for\nThe rest of the American industry\nGuy nonpolitical snow well got to bring it down on it however you want to do is I think it's the way and just go ahead and he died right\nYeah my wife said no be yes but he said the whole word and I wasn't I'm sure there are plenty curse words that have been honored in the oval office in the past certainly a LBJ had quite the ... Richard Nixon had quite the ... I'm sure there were plenty curvy but should should cut way up and dropping the BS bomb and the M. F.

of my radio affiliates you can catch a pod cast after the show or you can live stream on your smartphone so all those details are on my website ... that showed dot com so the president you know he's been very very active that the\nThe the rally last night in Pennsylvania\nAnd again ah you know the president criticized Obama for campaigning\nAfter Hurricane Sandy back in twenty twelve so Trump's tweet criticized Obama\nAnd you know damn well to Trump's going to get criticism for holding essentially a rally in Pennsylvania last night and from an optics standpoint or maybe should have delayed it a day or two or whatever they're not give the critics the ammunition\nOr so he did that then I'm flipping through the channels last night watching a rare late night cable TV 'cause I I don't I don't watch the news channels at night I don't watch a live Tucker Carlson Hannity's\nThe uh the uh the Megan I what what's her name um ah well Megan Kelly used to be on Fox but I'm a you know the MSNBC or\nYou know well what's her face I'm\nWell I'm drawing a blank here or ... you know they can always look alike ... wants to [laughter]\nSo help me thank you I I draw a blank you you know Rachel Maddow our Lawrence O'Donnell I don't I don't I don't know Cuomo's on CNN you've got a a Don Lemon and I I don't I don't watch those shows I mean don't last\nOpinion is the last thing I Want to do after I prepped all day and have done my radio show I don't want to go watch more of you know the\nThe just the stuff from the day being recycled I don't need to see the talking heads on TV so I don't want when there's a big news event like a hurricane yeah I'm watching I Want to see the aftermath I Want to see the latest footage in them though so I'm watching\nLast night so Trump to the rally ... calls in and and does this long interview\nWith a was a Gretchen Carlson not wrenching who's a shadow and Bream I confused immigrants across the left and she had the legal issues and she has a nice little payout but Shannon Bream Trump has this law is on the phone was shot and bring them this morning the president\nHoles in the Fox and friends and I think\nI think that I heard that he was on Fox and friends for like forty seven minutes\n\nThat's ah tell you what [laughter] that's a lot of air time anyway so a President Trump was asked by being president and was it worth it and the president comes up with a dollar figure on what he claims it's cost him\nTo be the president of the United states\nWell it certainly you know I'll tell you what I'll bet you it cost me you know I see these people saying oh Trump gets rich being president\nI'll bet you I lost billions of dollars since Cosby admitted as I said to my friend is a very wealthy friend I said you know how bad it costs me two or three million dollars and it's worth every penny of it I don't need the money and it's worth every penny because I'm doing so much for the country\nI mean what I've done in terms of costs what I've done in terms of the military rebuilding that military very shortly one that I have the strongest military we ever had [noise]\nYes it's it's nasty it's ... it's incredible the false reporting is so incredible\nBut I couple of things that first of all I don't know if he's lost two to three billion because his network according to Forbes is only in the high twos to maybe three billion to begin with\nA but I\nWill give up a lot of credit and I do because he has done a lot and there's been a lot of positive ah activity and\nAction from this president which he promised during his campaign and a lot of it's come to fruition and he's doing a amazing thing you know my number one reason for voting for Trump was securing the United States Supreme court going forward\nAnd as far as I'm concerned my major reason for voting for Trump has been fulfilled\nWith two Supreme Court seats now\nOr in the Gorsuch and of course the embattled crazy confirmation process and and the attempts of absolute democratic destruction of Brett Kavanaugh uh as far as I'm concerned that the reason why I voted for Trump has been accomplished\nWith Mao affirming of the Supreme Court the slow this was the most important thing to me now as far as the military and rebuilding the military that is a equally as important amazingly important to me and\nI I\n[noise] I I'm concerned about the military a ... a degradation over the years we've talked about it extensively on this program and I wish Trump all the power to rebuild and make the military was folks things are not getting easier\nThings are getting a lot tougher out there and that's why I laugh I mean it's it's ... it is asinine when you hear well why do we need a strong military why are we spending so much over here lead shut this down really\nAnd I've been I've been predicting this and I've been telling my audience this for years that we have massive problems on the horizon with the Chinese\nNumber two and I've been touting this since nine eleven I've been talking about this and guess what everything that I predicted everything that I've believed is coming through so Trump rebuilding the military\nIs absolutely essential however on the downside or deficits are growing greater and greater our national debt is is out of control\nSo we we've got to figure this out as well you got multiple schools of thought there are some areas are saying listen I it doesn't matter whether it's not going to catch up it's just a part of the equation that a national debt\nOr anywhere\n[noise] hey Sean Spicer and every mid term
