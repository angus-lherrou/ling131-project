truck driver with a ... company\nOh so you're a salesman so you know when we go through every day right everything on the left their body why you might think out either good man so what can we do for you to talk to me\nI'm going to try to make the show where it's easy to understand 'cause it's kind of convoluted but in may my wife and I were looking at home and the fuel rods ranch area we had lived there for a couple of years to be like the area\nProblem once every time that we got word of a house it was either gone or there were five for a job or is on it you know that day I think you know back then when they were really rolling\nWhere'd you under three hundred thousand or over three hundred thousand over three Seventy five okay keep going\nSo we we ... we walk through this house\nThousand or over three hundred thousand over three Seventy five okay keep going\nSo we we ... we walked out of and that they made an offer on it got accepted and there was there were several things wrong with that that weren't pointed out but anyway we got past all that we we we'd get some work at it and\nWe do White House ... so what I'm calling for is I Want to find out where do I start I'm ... to find out or you don't want to work and that start looking for the kind of house that we really do want\nAll right so so I just did this last month with another gentleman in desert shores it was the exact same scenario but but let me give you the real fact about the situation if you just bought it in may and now it's October you\nKnow it's probably not worth very much more than what you pay for it you come to that realization right absolutely\nOkay so what I did with this guy in desert chores and I'm going to say it on the air because I'm going to do it with you I\nWas I lifted his house where I thought it should be listed I charge them my full commission\nAnd I told him that if this house doesn't sell and you're going to lose money I'm going to list it for free for you not a hundred dollars on one percent not nominate list it for free because you're going to buy a house on the other side so I sat down with them I gave him some pointers on what to do thank\nGod we sold at higher because I got paid [laughter] on that\nScenario so I'm Will do the same for you to stay will give you a call come out look at the house will run that calms I'll show you exactly what I'm looking at and let's put a gay plan together and get your data that damn house rather 'cause if if you're not happy going there every day you're you're not happy period had his momma likely house\nAnd when you come over you're probably going to say what's your problem guy probably rare I just don't like it um and so I'm going to I'm going to call you this week and I'm all set up something gets over and then we can start a plan from there okay\nYeah sounds good to see if I really appreciate it then when I see a remind me to give you that twenty five bucks a grape street cafe to okay brother\n... thank you very much for I'd have a good weekend ... right right\nYeah and I liked that area where he's at I mean yeah but you know what if you don't like where you live I mean it it might not be he probably didn't want to sit on the air maybe it's not just the house maybe it's it's stupid neighbors [laughter] I ...\nI mean I Do like Silverado ranch no but my wife I've I've had one home like that and we just didn't like it than life\nOr the median is based on closed so the cells were a month or two months ago right yup so there's a little delay there but but the ... the main thing I think as we're still short image story\nWe still don't have enough sixty five hundred while my time it's a lot more there were three more for three or four months ago but two months of image\nOr a month and a half two months of ... is no law very low\nWell I I think in a normal market it's about five\nMonths yeah they were saying five or six months I think that's absurd but I mean if we get to ten thousand eleven twelve I mean that's probably when probably what we need I liked reading\nLevel so they're median price to a local for condos in town a town home sold in September was one Seventy that's up Twenty one ... present and why do you tell your head well\n... well rents right rents have gone up yeah yeah and and and the and condos of\nWell first time homebuyers can't afford that you know three hundred thousand ...\nHas it by ... by a townhouse or a condo but the other reason to is that it's still a great place for investors to buy\n... you could buy a townhouse for one Seventy while you get about fourteen hundred dollars a month rent right and then they operate where again at twelve thousand dollars so you're still at six percent better than leaving money in the bank right there so investors are all day long you have seven oh two seven three three\nFive nine six eight ... let me get my radio voice\nSo two seven three three five nine six eight okay Mara over here you in the

my question is um we have\nA baby coming and da da da da da da da da\nDa da da da da da da da da da na na with the baby I didn't pick I that's what I was wondering what how we should kind of attack that\nWhat I Would suggest you do is push pause on the total moneymaker over\nOkay in pile up cash as big pile as you can file between now and the time by becomes okay and um and then whatever you are piled up and and then when mommy and baby come home from the hospital and everybody's fine in April\nWas that event is then behind us in any worries are threats or anything we would have had about that is behind us right yeah um well I mean there's the whole thing of raising the baby\nBut I you know eight eight years\nYeah there is now but I but basically the you know we want to make sure labor and delivery and everything goes and we don't have any hiccups and when we got money okay so let's say you save up what what's your household income\nRight now it's about a Seventy seven thousand okay\nSo let's say you save up twenty five thousand dollars between now and then that you enjoy your twenty four thousand after you come home from the hospital and push play on your total money make over and take your account down to a thousand dollars and throw it at the at the uh student loan you will have lost no ground\nOkay unless you go maybe spending crazy during the next few months\nWe

close yeah\n[noise]\nThank you for joining us from uh this is the day room she was always a AAA eight to five five two to five\nBrittany is with us in Johnson City Tennessee Hi Brittany how are you I'm good how are you they better than I deserve what's up\n[noise] okay so my husband and I got a piece for our wedding and um we didn't get to the insurance part before we purchased our life insurance and we got part permanent part term and of course we watched the insurance or it last night and we just got\nAnd often turn about a week ago so I take that our financial advisor and said we immediately wanted to get rid of the term are alright the permanent and just have term and he said Dave Ramsey is talking about oh la permanent insurance not portfolio base permanent insurance which is what you\nDo is it still bad shall we still didn't get the term\nI don't know he doesn't know much about Dave Ramsey [laughter] okay Dave Ramsey does not ever invest I was real clear on the lesson you heard me yeah when you never know you under any circumstances to huge life insurance and investment vehicle\nOne hundred percent of the time it sucks\nSo would you say because what we told him we wanted to do it\nWhy would say more new financial advisor okay that's what I Would show you you don't have a financial advisor you have a life insurance\nSalesman okay just selling you in church\nBut what we were thinking we should do is switch to four hundred thousand yet that term\nOkay the selling you insurance\nSo what we were thinking we should do is put to four hundred thousand just that term H. and then the money we were 'cause it was like three hundred dollars a month which I Do a lot yeah um and just go ahead and open up Iraq Roth are IRA and start getting money into that\nIn bed mutual funds okay that's exactly what you learn in class was uh yeah so you already knew what she said yeah he did language tells me one of those things either this guy's a liar or he's ignorant\nRight [laughter] he's a family friend isn't T\nI'm actually one of our friends this apparently gave in our number ... have him for it as well\nYeah yeah okay so I I don't know which it is I mean I don't know I don't know but but I Do know that I've never in my life told someone to buy life insurance as an investment under any brand heading name or description ever\nNight and the last thing it on our term policy um on your class he said\nYou know twenty or Thirty years whatever was on ... and our term policy what then can we were eighty with hand\n[laughter] okay\nWhy don't you jump on the sand or insurance dot com and see what you can buy a twenty year level term policy for I think it's going to blow your mind how much is guys overcharged you for everything you soldier\nOkay [laughter] okay and you're probably going to end up just canceling everything with him so this kind of really needs a good firing\nOkay that sounds like well Oregon that Dale I'm In the end of this week\n[noise] All right thank you for calling in and when you compare the prices you'll see what I'm Talking about and you understood the lesson when we were talking about using life insurance as an investment vehicle and the reason is folks for those of you that I haven't seen the financial ... number for some reason I heard a Ramsey talk about this\nCase someone else ever brings this up because it does come up periodically\nUm the people who sell investment based or\nWhole life or permanent life or portfolio or universal or anything where there's an investment going into insurance\nAre not happy with me they don't like me and so they generally try to ignore me or lie about me or something else because I pretty much cost them all a bunch of business because they sell crap\nRap in a bag that's what it is okay it's pretty simple so here's the thing when you use life insurance as an investment vehicle hey you get a bad right of return\nRegardless of what they quote you after they take all of their fees\nWhich usually in the first two years is one hundred per cent\n\nSometimes up to four years is one hundred percent of what should have gone to the investment goes out in these even after that you're going to make three four five percent on your money and you should have been in the good mutual fund making ten eleven twelve percent on your money\nAnd that's where you should be when you die with cash value\nPortfolio universal indexed universal life insurance they pay only the face amount of the policy not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone so you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your\nSo you're not the extra money that you put into the investment that money is gone so you have a savings account that for the first several years I keep all your money after that they give you a bad right of return and when you die they keep it all\nThis is a bad savings account it's bad investment broker the pay the the\nLife insurance products that give you the opportunity to pay twenty times more than you would pay for term insurance in order that you create an investment inside of the policy\nAre basically the payday lender the middle class their crap\nAnd that's what Dave Ramsey is always there for twenty five years here on the air upset\nFor twenty five years is all I have owned myself I have never owned while this show was operating any kind of whole life or investment based life insurance of any kind\nEver not did get a horrible northwestern mutual whole life grotesque\nOld school one of the worst of the worst of the whole lives when I was in my early twenties and it was the same way Brittany it was a guy my wife knew from college came around selling right after we got married and we bought this crap from him\nI had it for about nine months until I finally sat down with some guys who unpacked the numbers for me and I about kicked my own but when I saw how bad it was and got rid of it and since then I have never owned it and since then I've never told anyone to buy\nAnything other than\nFifteen to twenty year term life insurance about ten to twelve times your income on you the best way to buy life insurance is through a broker the shops several companies\nThe best way to buy insurance of any connoisseur a broker that shop several companies and get you the best possible deal or their car insurance your homeowner's insurance your long term care insurance your life insurance or insurance of any kind\nLetter broke her shop among several companies and get you the best kinds of deal and that's why we've endorsed for about Twenty years ... insurance\nJeff sander has become a personal friend of mine during that time and I buy my personal life insurance from Santa and I don't own Zander insurance on around any of it that's the other a lot is always told about me\nI Would I Would have a whole lot more money if I did um Zander insurance goes Jeff has done rather well due to the Dave Ramsey endorsement but the reason they done well is he he's got a very very good system for getting you the best possible price on term life insurance and it takes about like Thirteen seconds\nAnd they don't sell your name the list of people when you go on there either so that's why I've endorsed it's real simple takes care of you guys you the listener and you need to get term life insurance have been cost that much so just jump in there and do it so Brittany thank you for calling with that question given the opportunity to clarify on that\nYet again yet again yet again yet again yet again\nYou need life insurance oh by the way a broker you know you know like even with your car insurance jump on the air with could get with the help they usually indoors local providers for your for what we called PNC property and casual you got your car and your homeowner's insurance\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping amongst\nYou can shop most people say three to eight hundred dollars a year on their car and homeowners when you're shopping among several companies\nInstead of using what we call a captive agent in the business captive aging consult for one company like a state for major or nationwide and ages or Peyton Manning and Brad Paisley can sing to you agent\nWas nationwide that's nationwide and you know but um and they're both good guys I like both of them it's nothing to do with that what you're paying for those guys when you when you use that insurance it's ... it's built in and neither one of those guys worked cheap I'll just tell you this is the day Ramsey show [noise]\n\nFocus is one of my favorite times of year the kids in school football season is here and people everywhere are preparing for the new routines well while you were in preparation mode think about this when was the last time you checked on your financial plan you heard me or do you even have one\nWhen the world's falling apart and you have a house paid for it gives you a different set of peace because I mean we don't know anything on any of our properties anywhere 'cause I've done research I've done detailed research in a hundred percent of the foreclosures occurred on them home with a mortgage\n\nSo we just we quit borrowing money so you do whatever you want it will be your friend either way but the way I live my life is how I answered questions on this show because it's brought me great wealth and great piece and great prosperity and a great sustainability end up terms and in down times\nEnjoy to not have a ...\nNamed country wide on my back bank of America on my back\nCan't even imagine it's been so long since I've had him that just just oh I think I Would probably like having anxiety attack it would be bad Carl is with us in Pennsylvania hate Carl welcome to the Dave Ramsey show\nHi Dave thanks for taking my call I appreciate it sure what's up hey I've got a good problem that I Hope you can give me some advice on I'm forty eight years old would that free or at least one we paid our house off yeah waiting yeah we're happy\nAbout that a decided to you know sell often investments just to do that people kind of said well why would you do that\nOh the people's money you're low interest that's right and I tell you what the peace of mind is great fun you know have a good problem I have is we were able to sell some stock options and I've got about five or six hundred thousand dollar suit that I'm trying to figure out what to do with a few that about the same amount in a four O. one K. which I have\nTo be in the market um so I'm a little nervous about possibly also investing amount of money in the market and I'm\nFive foot homes we for about ten home in the past and I'm thinking about using that money to buy a rental properties outright mhm and uh and do that and maybe diversify a little more ... than I wanted to hear what your thoughts were on that\nOkay um I think is excellent if you've got the stomach for real estate real estate gives you a better return than the stock market will give you but it's a higher hassle factor yeah it is you know you put money mutual fund they don't bother you you know but you you put put a renter and how much they go down here [laughter]\nAnd so there's a ... you know you've got the hassle of buying it you got to pay the taxes you got to pay the insurance I mean they're dealing with managing real estate all the aspects of it is a national soccer I've got a bunch of it I'm most by far I have more in real estate than I Do in the stock market I've got a lot in both\nBut a real estate will give you a better rate of return but it requires\nManagement by you or someone else and even if you have somebody else to what you got to manage the manager you cannot ignore it and so my real estate with an internal right of return which is the tax benefit the the you know that appreciation schedule in other words\nThe actual cash on cash return the ... minus the expenses as a return on investment and the growth in value you put those three things together and real estate you get the actual return which is called the interim right of return the IRR\nOkay which you would compare to a mutual fund right of return to do apples to apples higher hassle factor but most of my real estate is Seventeen to twenty percent ready to return\nI are are not casual cash is about ten\nOkay or a little less and some of it okay but uh I our our total with the increases in value and other stuff so I'm making more on that than I Am on the road to ... on the other maybe double what on that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it I mean it is um you know even though I don't\nOn the other maybe double what I'm that are making a mutual fund but I've got a lot more hassle with it\nI mean it's um you know even though I don't management and my son in law runs our our real estate company and he manages all of it and I don't I don't put up I don't personally\nDeal with a renter or something like that or anything or a vacancy are broken air conditioner all that he deals with all that stuff but but you know I went over all the ... this morning with him and to see how the properties are doing we check on them and he's telling me the stories of the drama he gets to deal with and such is real estate but I Love real estate do\nThat by asking our question I'm sure\nThey might probably point was a hundred thousand dollar house so at five hundred thousand [laughter] I have I can get five home mhm I'm all in a hundred thousand each mhm now so I don't I don't want 'em out like all the rents minus expenses are free and clear or somebody else said why are you by three and four fifty percent\nYeah well I don't ... you know I don't I don't think I Know your answer there on a leveraging like\nI'm not going to leveraging the I don't I ... I Want the extra pain in the butt of dealing with a banker on top of this right and on top of that I got risk and it just takes all the joy out of this whole discussion um what's the average price point in your area nationwide it's a little over two hundred thousand\nYeah probably about that I mean I can get a three bedroom one bath we'd better I mean after about a hundred maybe on it and twenty ... single family home yeah\nI'm probably gonna bump on up in the hundred and fifty range and you and do three three one fifty one Seventy five is right and there are rather than five ones and the only reason I'm telling you that is get a good by on whatever you by whatever it is I'm not above bonding right but the higher the class runner\nOr the more they paying rent or they users are dealing with generally speaking as a general category it's not always true I mean there's some wonderful people they rented every\nStrategy but you know people pay two dollars a month [noise]\nYou know it was a different different types of folk that you're dealing with their lives in my eyes and I both myself I'm not talking about somebody shut up to me\nThat I'm just as if you don't want [noise]\nAnd\nI get a lot of calls from listeners not knowing what to do with their timeshare I don't care of the reason you want out is because you were duped you can't afford it you inherited it the smart thing to do is just getting rid of\nIt they're horrible they never live up to the expectations the resorts sat and the only way you're going to exit you're timeshare safely legally and forever is with time share exit team they have offices all around the country where you can sit down face to face and review your contract to\nFind a solution they've accepted thousands of timeshare owners this year alone\nThere are the best in the business because they simply a more options for exit than anyone else it could be a long process\nBut there with you every step of the way and timeshare exit teams so confident in their exit service that if they don't get you out you get a full refund\nCalled eight for for nine nine nine exit and schedule a free consultation eight for for nine nine nine exit or timeshare exit team dot com\nI'm Jay foreigner CEO of Quicken Loans America's premier home purchases lender we've created a new way to protect you from unpredictable interest rates are exclusive rate shield approval first we lock your interest rate for up to Ninety Days then if rates go up your rates stays locked\nBut you've rates go down your rate drops either way you win call us today at eight hundred quicken or go to a rocket mortgage dot com racial upheaval only about I'm thirty three year fixed rate loans\nThe all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are an arrow radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com apple on your smartphone\nOr anywhere\nHey Sean Spicer and every mid term election since the civil war the president's party has lost an average of thirty two seats in the house of representatives and two in the Senate We're in for what will be a wild political season and there's going to be plenty to discuss and debate and dissect\nShe'll be sure to download my new podcast everything's gonna be alright beginning in October ... and I was an hour long weekly political pod cast covering the very latest news across the country and we provide listeners with unique inside and you can't get anywhere else everything's going to be All right and subscribe and download today on radio dot com and I to\nMe if you're a guy turning Eighteen you need to register with the selective service system it's the law and we wanted to make absolutely sure you get the message we brought in someone we knew you pay attention to [noise]\n[laughter] [noise] hey coach get on a computer that's not to make sure\nIt's for your own good cause not registering with selective service to cost you a shot at college loans and grants federal jobs job training in most states you could even cost you a driver's license\nTo\nGo to as as as dot Gov to register with selective service too many things done it's just something you have to do\nThese jobs overly alligator\nRegister with selective service at S.

I Hope I've given you enough to make good decision one way or the other but for me the first question is barely he's\nIf you least then I Would go with the uh with the accurate they've got some sweet least deals right now or if you're going to buy up I'd go with the accurate to just for the simple fact of um you know what's going to cost you down the road and that's something that\nYou know somebody that's going to spend this kind of money on a car\nTo take into consideration I tell people that all the time I Do have good dealers for both those brands\nUh Louis there in the Houston area I've got Gilman accurate\nAnd I've got advantage BMW midtown both very very good dealerships so I can help you no matter which way you go and I do appreciate your call and very much and let's just stay on the accurate kicking talked to John John welcome\nShe ate you call them very much and let's just stay on the accurate kicking talked to John John welcome\nTo Laurie good morning sir I I'd just last night I watched your review of the already ex yes you said really liked that thing I did I liked it a lot\nIs that is that the best that price group and that that type of car is that the best vehicle it's on the market right now\nAre you going to ... how long have you got to keep it are you going to bother you can ...\nWell that that falls into the next question I what I've gotten out of two thousand Thirteen jeep I've had it almost six years it's got twenty seven thousand miles on my mind\nI don't drive or a park so I don't know whether I I don't know whether I can get a leash that rewards the enough for heavy oil mileage or not but this most delicious I received fourteen or twelve thousand miles a year I eat well and it was Ninety five\nAnd I don't know and so obviously question\nI I don't know anybody that writes five thousand mile ...\nWell a lot of lot of the car companies do I've done two of them in a row are but I'm not a hundred percent sure about accurate if they do five thousand miles lease or not I've had two straight in fact maybe three and five thousand miles urine I over shot that by\nDouble but that's the least I could get which made the payment lowers if you didn't release it would you pay cash for it or would you finance\nWell I Would probably finance part of it I Would get probably twenty eight thousand for the gene that I've got as it sets because of the little knowledge and the actual condition of so I'd probably finance whatever the battles that twenty eight to ... or maybe twenty grand something like that\nThat girlie steals a really good right now if you were going to\nIf you got to lease whether it be the hardy eggs I tell you to look at the Lexus an ax\nA which is I've helped a lot of people get and they just love these things I think that the actors got more room inside certainly got more cargo area\nBut there are some swing least deals on the Lexus as well now you are correct on your jeep in that the ... market right now is red hot is it a wrangler\nIt's a regular limited Sheera everything on it at Ford or hard top\n... heart stopped ... the only thing I did not get was a leather seats because of a leather seats and James kind of silly\nNow I'm with you or what you want to do is if you do leave and I would I Love leasing of do it myself um you know ... if you get that mileage down take all the equity out of the jeep when you tried it in\nAnd set it aside and three years from now if you don't lock leasing you've got a hefty hefty down payment on a purchase\nA because whenever you put down on a least John is gone at the end of the lease the residual value is set up front is not going to change and that's the amount that you can buy the vehicle for so if you put a big chunk of money down that's all gone at the end of the least now you've had a lower payment no question\nBut it's just not smart to put a lot of money down on all these I tell people to you know at the most so to give them an extra\nAnd and see if they if they ride of five thousand a mile per year lease if they do then I Would say keep all the cash out of the jeep and go with the least you want to talk to the Lexus declare like lies a pastels\nDo that I Would say keep all the cash out of the jeep and go with the least you want to talk to elections declare like ... a gym there she's great gal you could look at
