national correspondent for NBC News and this really irks me there was a longer interview on MSNBC they use they truncated ports\nAnd I I'm not big big problems I get into that in a second I thought that maybe it was a good time for me to look for the mark judge book that book that he wrote this fictional accounts allegedly a based on his life and the book as you might have heard is cold wasted\nTails of an Gen x drunk meaning generation X drunk by mark judge\nThis is the friends of Kavanaugh's during\nA high school who everyone's been on the proud for everyone tried to interview him he's had an interesting life he's a cancer survivor he has had bouts with alcoholism apparently and I listen I wished nothing but the the best mark judge hopefully security is a medical issues and has worked on his\nPersonal demons bought a\nYou know he he didn't he didn't want to be part of it he wants to just to to get out of this he's issued statements that he couldn't recall these parties couldn't recall these incidents or or any of the suggestions of want Brett Kavanaugh has been accused of and of course some are saying oh but in this book wasted tales of agenda is drunk\nAnd then he had a character by the name of bart\nOh Kevin on that must be a Brett Kavanaugh right\nEven if it's based on him or friends or if they use friends' names are altered names or just to you know draw some familiarity but still you can change the story if you're writing a piece that contain some fictional account so I I wanted to read the book\nSo I went on to Amazon dot com last night to look for the book and oh here it is looking as early as two stars or the reviews by summer are not great on the book\nIs it uh\nIt is available there are um uh some buying options here and as I scroll down to see the price and the book is not currently in print although somebody might want to put this back out it might be a little demand for this book now as I scroll down oh there's one used\nCopy of mark judges book\nFor one thousand nine hundred Ninety nine dollars right so then I'm just checking it now\nAnd the price has been lowered\nThe price is now one thousand nine hundred and forty nine dollars\nAnd Ninety nine cents so I better jump on this bargain while I can because ah that's a fifty dollar savings folks and that's that's pretty John enormous years I I've been to jump on this before somebody else a snake this copy out from underneath of me\nA ... click here for all buying options let me see if there were more ...\nI don't think this is an Amazon deal I'm sure this is a a private seller a son of really so if I buy this book for one thousand nine hundred and forty nine dollars Ninety nine cents\nI still have to pay three dollars Ninety nine\nCents shipping oh you're kidding me for nearly two grand you can't give me free shipping\nAnyway I passed on the book I I did not push the add that to my heart buttons yeah uh I I I didn't do it\nI'm I'm gonna have to hold off on reading the mark judge Bork for now I'd phones or a loaded here will grab your calls coming up on ... eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine if you want to get out and let's get into some more serious issues\nThe NBC interview with Kate Snow this was an embarrassment and a bombing nation I'm going to tell you why\nNext also the presidents\nSame for boys young men in America all back next [noise]\nGoes on forty\nBut no\nRight now five four jugs of map of synthetic motor oil are only Eighteen to protect your interest from sludge and extreme temperatures but did you know it also protects our troops you put each purchase of Napa Folsom ... Ninety nine\nA portion goes to being ... fallen hero spot quality ... people that snapping no well I Know generously expresses just press as a matter of political the local taxes there was like with the proper instead I'm thirty one Eighteen\n... to discuss the issues that I if I have time I'll get into that but ah before I go to phones here from the NBC story\nYou know she was backing away\nShe's she's she's not backing away from some of the claims she initially made when ... first came out with that big reveal of this new third individual accusing Brett Kavanaugh and she's a she's backed off of some of these claims\nSo NBC News of the cage snow they said they couldn't be sure\nUh that uh they reported that that this sweating it couldn't be sure that Kavanaugh was one of the boys\nDuring a party of the Nineteen eighties so that that's a back off\nThat and that's that's a change in the story\nSo remember this this sworn affidavit that came out last week from this this Julie sweat make\nA that al ... release that she was the victim of a gang rape at a party and\nShe saw Kavanaugh misbehaving and acting aggressively toward women now though she says I cannot specifically say that he Kavanaugh was one of the ones who assaulted me\nBut before this happened to me at the party I saw Brett Kavanaugh there I saw a mark judge and they were hanging out where I started to feel this oriented and where the room was and where the other boys were hanging out and laughing\n\nSo you know again this is incredibly vague in the sworn statements she claimed the cabinet consistently engaged in excessive drinking and inappropriate contact of a sexual nature with women in the early eighties so when NBC aired this on MSNBC on cable\nCage so said quote NBC News for the record has not been able to independently verify or claims there are things she told us on camera that differ from her written statements last week\nSo that was on MSNBC but they didn't have the same disclaimer when they ran excerpts on the NBC nightly news where many more millions of people see that\nSo that's my that's my big problem that's a big beef that I have with at NBC News here and you know she's she's tracking\nCheers backtracking you know on some of these details you know in a in a statement last week the cabin on march charge they weren't the party's you was drugs you was gang raped and I remember she them accused cabin all this whole thing or her specifically but she claimed that she witnessed\nKavanaugh participate in gang rapes I mean what what I was from the the initial claim\nHe was a very aggressive very sloppy ah he was very I mean I saw him go up and are going to girls and Paul on them touching them in private parts trying to shift clothing\nI saw a Push Girls against the wall he would pretend the stumbling stumble into them pushing them into a wall he would grow them but then again we have we have changes we have differences in what she originally said or in the swan statement versus what she told\nNBC News you know what what are the issues was that she saw\nA you know with Kavanaugh was responsible for spiking the punch at some of these parties and now I Know ah you know just he's so she saw him a round the container holding the punch\nSo she's she's changing these stories\nYou know also she's backtracking apparently here it appears that way on that their capital was also involved in these gang rapes are now she's saying only that I Would see him congregated near the rooms with boys outside rooms where she thought\nThat boys were gathering in order to rape girls I mean this is I I mean really\nIt in a court of law this crap was going to hold up\nSo we've got New Orleans areas where her story is shifting and changing you know watching the ex served on NBC nightly news last night I saw her blinking and looking down and I can just some of the ...\nWhen someone's not telling the truth in my opinion so again NBC News why are you giving sweating at the time of\nDay a\nSalacious a tabloid dish and you should have been above the sweat Nick free or let's\nGrab a couple of calls here on snow Nelson Trump audio I Want to play from earlier today a hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine left hits\nA mess up people on New York Long Island where I Will be later this evening because of my daughter's soccer commitments

call I appreciate it as oh as far as the FBI report a silken you grab me the latest just prior to coming on\nThere were reports that the the new supplemental FBI report that it would not be made public\nA but the question is one of the things that the caller just said before he uh start recruiting or is that uh he suggested that the report is going to leak so this is the report is apparently going to be in the hands of the White House or the Senate\nOr will the Senate committee obviously will the Senate Judiciary committee they will see the report as well\nSo will the report a leak as the caller suggested you know I I don't know but there are rumblings and reports that this the supplemental report will not be made public back to the phones let's grab by how about Tony in Washington DC let's go to the swamp hello Tony you're on Smith\nHello hey I I Believe that the sweat Nick interviewed with good due to the fact that it shows the uh the the definition of Kavanaugh's character ah that um they will just continue to be coached and do anything that can hurt this guy even without the proof\nSo your thought is that NBC did a service by showing sweat neck because most people would look at her and deem her to be\nNo ... that was MSNBC but now I'm be the one they feed the Kool Aid\nWell well not all that was the same interviewed on so MSNBC you have the long interview I watched that right certainly MSNBC in the long interview and then the NBC nightly news broadcast last night they took an excerpt of the longer MSNBC interview\nAnd they play that so your suggestion is is that NBC while I don't think NBC should have given her the time of day of giving her any degree of a platform you think that\nNBC showing her it it shows that she's not a credible individuals that what you're suggesting actually\nAnd that and be NBC or just feed the Kool Aid for um the the the whole situation\nCertainly on the MSNBC side more so but I've I have plenty of issues on the broadcast side

experience for well\nYou know well I was I I don't want to go down that road I don't want to trivialize any type of a soldier abusive rape allegations\nOr incidents where we can confirm that we know when things happen just as there are bad things that happened but there are a lot of questions about her story that you know her claim was that she was gang raped\nBut then you know according to our timeline that she went back after that\nAlso the fact that she was older they these individuals' why was she going to high school parties if she was already in college a lot of questions regarding

[laughter] ah the\nFox is not dealing with the now ... got someone else on I'd are suicides at Fox dealt with it a couple of minutes ago\nUh the Fox is not dealing with the now ... got someone else on Eid al ... says that Fox dealt with it a couple of minutes ago\nAnd then ah MSNBC now it says on the screen Trump says wouldn't be acceptable to Capitol lied to Senate I said that they were discussing this uh apparently right now uh I don't know if MSNBC has gone to New York times route\nBut just to understand what's going on and again this is going to be a a another one of these big stories it says the president has long sold himself as a self made billionaire but at times investigation found that he received at least\nFour hundred Thirteen million in today's dollars from his father's real estate empire much\nOf it through tax Dodgers in the Nineteen nineties\nPresident Trump participated in dubious tax schemes during the Nineteen nineties including instances of outright fraud that greatly increased the fortune he received from his parents and investigation by the New York times is found\nThe uh Mr Trump won the presidency proclaiming himself a self made billionaire and that he has long insisted that his father the legendary New York city building Fred seat Trump provided almost no financial help\n\nBut the times investigation based on a vast trove of confidential tax returns\nAnd financial records reveals that Mr Trump receive the equivalent today of at least four hundred Thirteen million dollars from his father's real estate empire starting when he was a toddler and continuing to this day\nI well first of all\nI'm curious of vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records\n[noise] what's the first question here who the hell\nRevealed or how they held the New York times get their hands on a quote vast trove of confidential tax returns and financial records somebody had to give this them in New York Times\nThat's what I Want to know where and of course we're not going to find out and I imagine the president of the comments on this is going to talk you know called the failing New York times fake news on the times continues to say much of this money came to Mr Trump\nBecause he helped his parents dodged taxes he had a sibling set up a sham corporation\nTo disguise millions of dollars in gifts from their parents records and interview show records indicate that Mr Trump helped his father take improper tax deductions worth millions more he also help formulate a strategy\nTo undervalue is parents real estate holdings by hundreds of millions of dollars on tax returns sharply reducing the tax bill when those properties were transferred to him and his siblings\nThese maneuvers met with little resistance from the Internal Revenue service the times found\nThe president's parents Fred and Mary Trump transferred well over one billion dollars in wealth\nTo their children which could have produced a tax bill of at least five hundred and fifty million under the fifty five percent tax rate then imposed on gifts and inheritance is\nThe trumps paid a total of fifty two point two million or about five percent\nAnd the inheritance is the Trump paid a total of fifty two point two million or about five percent tax according to records\nThe president declined repeated requests silver several weeks to comment for the articles of the Trump knew this was coming\nSo clearly New York times been working on this for weeks and they've gone to Trump for comments or the president knew that it was just a matter of time before the New York times came out with something regarding his taxes but a lawyer for Mr Trump Charles Jay harder\nProvided a written statement on Monday one day after the time sent the detailed description of its findings the New York times allegations of fraud and tax evasion are one hundred percent falls and\nHighly defamatory Mr harder said there was no fraud or tax evasion by anyone the facts upon which the times based it's false allegations are extremely inaccurate\n[noise] so there you go that's or just um\n[noise]\nThat's just a a a chunk here let's see the president's brother Robert Trump issued a statement on behalf of the Trump family\nIt says are [noise]\nExcuse me I'm choking a little bit here [laughter] uh it says our dear father Fred see Trump passed away in June of Nineteen Ninety nine a beloved mother Mary Ann from passed away in August of two thousand\nAll appropriate gift in a state tax returns were filed and the require taxes were paid our father's estate was closed in two thousand one by both the Internal Revenue service and the New York state tax authorities and our mothers estate was closed in two thousand for our family\nHas no other comment on these matters that happened more than twenty or some Twenty years ago and would appreciate your respecting the privacy of our deceased parents and may God rest their souls\n\nSo this is the quote from the president's brother are surviving brother this is Robert because he had a brother that died of alcoholism and also less than half do I believe that from\nAnd and the Trump team and the Trump corporations that they are wielding deal on taxes I let it happens\nIs if this degree of for all the New York times is claiming who I mean they claimed to have the goods they claimed to have the documents again the big question here is who gave the documents had they get a hold of this material\nAlso oh we'll be IRS investigate because a while you always hear that all the IRS doesn't go you know or they don't go back more than seven years or or typically now I I think it's you know after three or four years you can get rid of tax documents\nBut here's the issue [noise] so you have a statute of limitations on on certain things when it comes to taxes but when it comes to fraud\nMy understanding is that there is no statute of limitations so if fraud can be proved you're not protected by oh the clock has run out on ya\nSo I don't believe there is that when it comes to the IRS taxes that if there was fraud that statute of limitations applies eight hundred eight so we'll see what happens here we'll we'll see what Trump's comment things going to be\nI Know he's going to be asked about it the question is\nWill the president comment then will the IRS a poke around them and what's going to be the story you [noise]\n[noise] [noise]\nWill the president comment and will the IRS poke around them and what's\nGoing to be the story you tides or the FBI investigation or incidentally the lawyer for Deborah Ramirez accusing number two is saying that they don't think that the FBI is conducting a series investigation I I think that's insulting\nI I'm Sorry I don't think Christopher Wray the FBI Director with eyes and scrutiny\nUpon him and his agency on multiple levels I don't\nBelieve that the FBI would attempt any kind of a a sham investigation here\nOn the word we have is that the FBI's file report from its misconduct inquiry into Brett Kavanaugh\nWill be available for senators only not the public this is according to Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell he said this earlier today are also a there was a closed door lunch with Republicans earlier today\nAnd they\nClaim they did not know exactly when the FBI would finish their investigation but it was suggested according to multiple sources this was being reported by the hill that it could happen as early as Wednesday so the FBI could be done with their investigation\nTomorrow which would certainly
