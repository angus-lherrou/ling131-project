they have these emergency towers they can bring in to get you on the air with reduced power but still\nA you know some of these details are incredible now there's a lot of other stuff we've got to cover today there's a lot of other areas that I that I Want to push into or just some of the the interesting stats here and and what happens in this kind of an event and you know\nAround the country you know wherever you're watching or wherever you are listening to the Schmidt show you know we all have different types of natural disasters of wild fires out west a earthquakes for instance in California and the potential in Oregon and Washington state's\nAh you know we have hurricane activity along the whole eastern seaboard and the Gulf Coast uh obviously Texas Louisiana all the way round Florida the Carolinas Georgia or Virginia at center here\nNow when it comes to these types of storms and and this is where you have a a a a cooperation agreement\nAnd uh it's it's good to know all those that are losing power who I've lost power\nIn these affected areas that there are agreements with the power companies uh uh that serve the location locally where there's a outages you have power companies around\nAround the you know various states around the country that are part of a consortium they've got a a cooperation agreement so the good news is with this storm are getting ready to hit Florida you had a lot of power crews from different power companies\nFrom a around the country that they've got crews they'd get in their trucks and they literally will drive hundreds and hundreds of miles I mean it's not out of the question but your power crews that come from Wisconsin and Minnesota and Michigan\nAre you driving great distances with their power trucks to help restore power in these affected areas and I know for a fact\nThat the\nThe power companies from around the U.S did start making their way and some are already in place in safe areas and they are staged a weather event is over them the the power companies from all around the country will then can for a converge on the affected areas\nTo assist in bringing the power back so\nThat's a you know at least something of a positive note that they try to get power back as quickly as possible but you are going on there I'll tell you right now and you're gonna areas that are going to be without power potentially for weeks the other issue at hand here folks which uh\nUh uh I'm sad to say that\nThere are people that chose not to evacuate ah the people that chose not to evacuate and in many cases they were looking at a category to or you know\nTouching into a carrot category three\nBut here we have a storm that intensified to a category for a strong for right on the precipice of becoming a category five hurricane and the issue at play here is the intensity forecasting\nIs where the weather professionals lack they'll they'll tell you hey as forests storm track\nOur history you look at all the different models the U.S miles the u._k. model all the satellite data\nThey're getting pretty good in fact I mean their target area here was was pretty damn close now it is easier when you're a hurricane forms in the Gulf of Mexico and\nIt is literally days away from striking\nIt's different than when you're trying to project yeah you know ten days or two weeks out as a hurricane is barreling across the Atlantic and then into the southern Caribbean and in the ... on to the east coast of the u._s. or into the Gulf of Mexico are affecting Texas Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Florida et cetera\nSo you know obviously being closer to the forecast thing as far as track is going to be better however they are getting and they have been pretty good at track it intensity over whether pros\nAll the meteorologist will tell you that it's the intensity forecasting which is lacking\nSo it was a category two maybe it was going to be a three that may have predicted a three and landfall and here we are almost a category\nFive\nSo how many people said because the intensity forecast the gays and all I can handle it too but even a three the fact that there was a forecast for free all yesterday\nI mean that's still a major that's considered a major hurricane a category three but then a juice up even more with the fact that it was just a couple of miles shy of a category five\nUp right at landfall a

the president's weeded out deporting\nThe White House for Erie, Pennsylvania I cannot disappoint the thousands of people that are there and the thousands that are going I look forward to seeing everyone this evening\nSo ah the president will defensive there because I was and he's got to get him telling you right now it's going to happen\nThat he's going to be attacked or in I think the usual suspect media that here we have that's a natural disaster we've got the hurricane the tip of Florida Gulf Coast a heading into Georgia in the Carolinas and\nNow the president heads off for a campaign style rally in Erie, Pennsylvania tonight so he's going to be attacked on this front and the president\nObviously free emptive leads tweeting out that you don't want it doesn't want to disappoint thousands and thousands of people that are looking forward to seeing him this evening\nBut that was even with him trying to a head off\nAt least the criticism you know that the criticism is going to be there absolutely you know politics with what's going on here as far as the house or potentially a play Democrats hoping to even take the Senate there's something important I'll tell me about that next [noise]\nThe labor for McCain what's in the news desk is the second zanu soggy forty AM\nWhat could make or break a governor Rick Scott in his quest\nTo take the scene away from the Democrat Bill Nelson in Florida for the U.S Senate or is going to be I think viewed through the lens of how the aftermath of this hurricane goes listen we're we're a month shy here of the mid term elections\nWhere right around a month shy so Rick Scott as governor of Florida is going to be judged and he's going to be put under an extreme microscope right now and this could be the make or break\nSo the way the state of Florida under the direction of Governor Scott handles the aftermath of this hurricane I think it's going to have an amazing impact on whether ... and the polling has been a pretty close so it can do it once the latest a a real clear politics average getting given the latest\nOn the uh Bill Nelson and the Rick Scott race and listen this has national implications because of the Democrats pushing to not only take back the house but they want to take back the Senate\nAnd they don't think that it's completely out of the question but a Rick Scott winning and taking that seat away from a Democrat or that certainly helps Republicans retain the the US Senate\nAnd I'm telling you right now that the way the Rick Scott the way the state of Florida responds now is going to be very significant and could be the make or break for Rick Scott winning that Senate seat and putting it in Republican hands and taking it away\nFrom Democrat Bill Nelson\nSo ah let's all watch this now some of the video on this storm some of the video that it's starting to make its way out I I've seen video now of a ...\nBusiness roof being killed off in the video was taken from what appears to be a high rise or a hotel or along Panama City beach and a a a lower\nA floor or from from a higher for that's where the video was taken from a you know all of the the the commercial building adjacent to this hotel or or condo high rise or someone took video out of the window and you can see a roof the roof of this uh this business or commercial building completely peel off\nThere is other video of some beachfront homes\nBeing destroyed I mean ripped apart\nAlong Panama City beach and that is to the west the twenty twenty five miles to the er North West or west northwest of\nWe're landfall was you know around the Mexico beach area and of course the worst part of a hurricane is on that front right quadrant or the north eastern side that's the worst and here we have\nTo the to the west to the west\nWe have a you know a ... structures being ripped apart along Panama City beach so you know just to understand the destruction as you know hurricane Michael is a a category for now we're sitting here for forty two eastern time\nAnd the hurricane is still a category for as the eye is completely over land now to the north west of Tallahassee\nBut I I'm looking at video again along Panama City beach and there are structures that have been completely ripped apart it looks like some ah\nSome structures that were actually under construction have been ripped apart and the other thing folks\nAre a lot of people get injured and there are fatalities in the aftermath it's not just the storm surge uh people uh you know killed by a wall of water or drown\nOr what ... and not only on the wind damage and and the collapse obviously we in the Carolinas that ... in North Carolina we have the it was a north and South Carolina we have the awful during Florence the awful story of the mother and the infant killed when a tree fell down the\nThe father was pinned them a thought they were going to have to amputate his legs\nOn the spot to get him out\nAs his wife and infant child were were killed\nUh so yeah it's water it's it's the storm surge it certainly is the potential from a flying debris during the wind but in the aftermath folks are going to tell you right now we're going to get the reports of deaths\nAfterward people dying from electrocution from downed power lines\nAre ... they're going to be injuries with chainsaws you're gonna you're gonna potential death with people and chainsaws as they're trying to take the limbs down\nAnd remove praise from roadways you're going to have a bunch of you know warriors out they would change the laws that are they going to have a you know a snap back on a chainsaw that's happened where people die so even after the storm has done some of the most dangerous\nTimes are in the cleanup and the immediate aftermath so I sincerely hope that people take extreme caution\nOr by the way she was telling me that in the state of Florida\nThat the Democrat Bill Nelson according to the real clear politics average Bill Nelson the Democrat is up two point four points\nOver governor Rick Scott and of course a two point four points is totally within the statistical margin of error\nAnd and and all ... and and they're all there are also a couple of recent polls that might not be part of the average but the point I'm trying to make is\nIs that the Governor Scott needs to really kicked butt in the aftermath with a less than a month until the mid terms or they need to really do an amazing job and he knows this trust me his political team absolutely knows this\n[noise] yeah we we don't need anyone dying and nursing homes at this point that we need to make sure that the emergency response in the state of Florida in all of these affected areas is swift and very effective\nBut some of the video clips of the extreme flooding and storm surge water up to rule was\nUp to second stories now in some of these areas or it's going to be a hell of a clean up and it's going to be quite some time folks\nUh yes I Will be the later tonight or certainly tomorrow until we have a real full assessment of how much damage or this storm has created we have a clip that has been released by ABC News of this upcoming special\nOf Tommy yum has a in Africa and interviewing the first lady\nMillennia Trump\nAnd millennia address well the Kavanaugh's confirmation battle and the me too movement and I'll tell you right now that she was absolutely spot on\nWith first lady Melania Trump telling ABC's Tom ... and he does the weekend anchoring on ABC world news tonight and then he's also a reporter national corresponded during the week or so millennia Trump told Tom ... that she supports women\nThey should be heard but well I'll let you hear the audio this is the the audio or from the interview you'll even hear the question\nI asked by Tommy on us so I Want to play a role to play a little chunk care so let's see if we if we've got the uh the audio ready to roll yeah my uh what blood listen I\nWould not talk about it they know who they are I didn't want I don't want to put them out and found of the world so here in town here and have a question wide\nRanging interview we also asked the first lady about some of the major events that have shaped and walked her husband's White House and the country including the me too movement here we\nGo I don't think I've had many false accusations\nJust last week her husband's sharing that sentiment as the FBI investigating judge Brett Kavanaugh over an accusation of highschool sexual assault\nWhat is your take about the me too movement though do you believe in them do you support the me too movement\nI support the men and they need to be say we need to support them and you know also men not just the men\nDo you think men and in in the news that I've been ...\nAre now here's the money unless it\nHad been treated unfairly you need to have a really high to have you ... you know if you're ... or something so that evidence someone in my view that and say how could you say that this is Trump you need to stand with women going on with\nThem but we need to remove too soon after that he could not to say to somebody I was you know sex and the assault that aren't\nSo what's wrong with that now millennia Trump the first lady she's already being attacked for them is that oh and you even heard Tom ... like you know you're going to be accused of outstanding what what is wrong with yeah\nSexual assault any type of a sexual impropriety or activity against women is abhorrent if it's awful but it can't just be a flippant accusation you need to prove it it's it's it's tamped down is innocent until proven guilty not the other way around\nSo millennia Trump the first place she is spot on here she was a hundred percent accurate\nBring you up for other important tasks like making a

of the the deaths that occur in a in a hurricane occur after\nA ... the chain so that's a lot of times people will put the generators to close the carbon monoxide poisoning the clean up trees falling

are slammed the hurricane center Miami or if you want to project a from a geographic standpoint is there any way to tell when this thing is going to lose hurricane status and become a tropical storm and how how far into Georgia is it going\nYet and still over a complete land remain a a a category three or a category two or one\nSure well we expect that uh we expect it to lose hurricane strength overnight you know hurricanes ... do we can pretty reliably\nOver over over land up by the time it hit central Georgia we expect it to be a tropical storm but we do expect or those tropical storm force winds to move up the coast of Georgia South Carolina North Carolina over the next day or so uh so it's this event is by no means over a for those states\nAnd not to mention rain activity and they already ranch the Carolinas after Florence Eric blank National Hurricane center in Miami Eric thanks for joining us on these guys are slammed you're\nAll right so they have the latest uh from the pros or back to this story guy was building an explosive to blow himself up\nA around election day to protest the direction of the country uh folks\nIf you're just joining us I came out in the bottom the are breaking that we were able to get the the National Hurricane center I'm gonna let me revisit this 'cause it was crazy so I'm New York ma'am plan to go down to DC and\nAnd self destruct blow himself up because he's on a happy with the direction of the country so the cops the FBI or obviously fully investigating a searching the Hudson Valley New York home today they learned of the plot\nThat he was allegedly building a bomb in order to blow himself up in DC so I'm back to the channel for New York story investigators say they were concerned the man identified as Paul Rosen field\nAnd he was a at his home in orange county New York was in the process of acquiring bomb parts officials tell news for the rose infield\nHad no criminal history but had told a reporter in Pennsylvania that he planned to blow himself up on the Washington Mall around the election day because he was angry\nAt the country's direction\nHe had no plans to hurt anyone else he's believed to be a lone act or not affiliated with any terrorist group or ideology and I'm looking at\nLooking at what appears to be his picture and I you know just doesn't appear to be that type of individual that would\nWould wanna sell family doing well I Would be to set yourself on fire but a ... self explosive eight I'll just invent the word here ah Rosen field expected to appear in federal court in white plains on the federal charges\nWhich has not may have been made public yet\nUh and uh the Rockland County supervisor ah we're I guess he's from Memphis county and I grew up when I was a kid in Rockland County a little place called menu at until I was eleven\nOr they say that there was a there is no danger to the public but how about that I plan to blow himself up\n... speaking of terrorism in a couple of things here and then I wouldn't be as a foreign domestic terrorism I Would imagine you know but just not targeting anybody else but speaking of terrorism you remember the Islamic radicals that rented a Home Depot truck\nOne of those rental Home Depot pickup trucks you like Nineteen Ninety five around town plus mileage I Would imagine I rented one of those trucks this is ah about a year ago\nAnd he\nDrove into Manhattan and then ran people over on a bike and ...\nPeople were killed there were a dozen or so injured but less than it is the latest now lawyers for the guy charged with killing him a papal\nA said today\nThat the death penalty as far as federal ... New York doesn't have a death penalty but with federal charges there's a death penalty that she'll be ruled out because President Trump\nWas uninformed and full of range when he called forced huh so lawyers filed papers actually yesterday in Manhattan federal court on behalf of this safe for laws St Paul's\nAnd the claim is that Mr Trump President Trump irrevocably tainted the legal process when he tweeted in all capital letters a day after the attack that site palm should get the death penalty\nAnd this is the actual tweet from President Trump\nBack on the October first or so a a twenty seven team a New York city telling terrorists was happy as he asked to hang the ISIS flag in his hospital room he killed eight people badly injured twelve should get death penalty\nOr he was arrested actually I'm Sorry this was I said I told her first I guess this was like oh that was Halloween that's where it was October thirty first so correction\nAnd he was arrested you know right after the event he's pleaded not guilty I had an ISIS flag here there was an ISIS flag in the pickup truck if I'm not mistaken when he was arrested\nAnd now his lawyers trying to give the death penalty off the table because President Trump tweeted that he should get the death penalty I give me a break\nYou know I may be the president should refrain from from a you know potential tamed but you know I can imagine you know I was in front page of the history of saying whatever the hell he wants to say you know sometimes I sometimes I don't see it probably would have been better if the president\nAs are the legal process was just taking its initial foothold probably better if the president did not suggest a a federal death penalty but anyway I hopefully\nThe the lawyers will not be successful in a federal judge agreeing with the death penalty ought to be off the table 'cause I I ... I agree that he ought to get the death penalty\nYou know renting a Home Depot pickup truck to then ram into people to inflict as much damage with pickup truck you know a couple of times versus a flesh and blood and bone I mean come on\n\nHis impetuous decision was uninformed and full of rage he actually reveled in the prospect of condemning Mr ... did die in the home of the horrible crime he committed\nBut the constitution does not tolerate a death penalty scheme driven by blood service or revenge that's what the lawyers for this or just ISIS inspired\nMonster put in there and then filing", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "10"}
