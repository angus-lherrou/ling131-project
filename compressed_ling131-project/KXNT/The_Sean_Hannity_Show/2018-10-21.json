sideways with your family that that doesn't mean the same thing but it does and the rest of the world and the genealogy world that's a good thing and we'll explain why and what it means and why and how you should do it\nWill explain that coming up in about\nTen minutes or so later in the show this guy from Boston very\nWas the crossing the ocean and how you can find and develop some of that material is a lot of fun David Allan Lambert will be here\nIn fact he's going to be here even sooner pay just to remind or if you haven't done it yet sign up for our weekly Jeannie newsletter it's

stories you're going to love it but right now let us oh he's right here David our lab\nOr a studio with us today nice to see if I have to actually see you in front of it yes it\nDoesn't happen that often which is why we're going to do a bonus segment here a little bit later on with you I'm Glad I walked in pick that brain of yours but right now let's get on with our family he's for news we got a lot of good stories today to share relating the family history starting with\nThe greatest of all times Muhammad Ali\nThis is going to knock you out I'll tell you the genie a logical world has just learnt that great Muhammad Ali is actually the third great grandson of archer Alexander who was one of these people from history you probably wouldn't know about but he is actually the model for the emancipation statue in Washington DC\nWhat was included and what was that included and all three of the files you know because everybody have brothers out of the same family and they're serving not the same units but they're all survey from the same county\nSo backtracking that's a little bit my third great grandparents came from Scotland and settled in Washington County Ohio\nWhere they had eleven children while nice yeah nice to have family\nWhile they had eleven children from what I could tell from the census records and from the the will of my third great grandfather well I start going through these pension files and I discovered that one of them one out of the three had abstract to the family Bible that family record out of the family\nAnd lifting all that bird and and what not\nWhat went on that there were very few local areas that recorded birds and deaths the way people did in their own family Bible that that's where I kept\nYeah exactly and you know he was born in Ohio but in a time period before Ohio with keeping civil birth records well he needed to prove how old he was to get an increase in his pension\nSo what does he do he takes the family Bible to the local pension office that pension officer makes this beautiful transcript of the family record and they have a nice notary signature on it you know it's all nice and official\nBut in that pension file it mentions a twelve child and the\nChild up a little boy named William only lived a few days but he was born and he died between censuses and both for Ohio was keeping civil birth and death records\nSo now you have hopefully completed the family\nYeah it's complete as far as that family Bible appears to be and from what other records I have found but I just thought it was fascinating that out of the three brothers and they're\nVery robust civil war pension styles only a lot of them have this family Bible and it was only in that family Bible that lifted that other brother of theirs who sadly died and infancy\nAnd this is why it's so important to look at those siblings I had a similar thing back in Nineteen sixty eight to my mother approach to my dad's aunt who would have been a check because she was my great aunt\nAnd she provided all kinds of little family history notes from her memory\nThat proved over the decades to be very useful and she sent him just a few months before she died and she had mentioned in there the married name of his sister of my great great grandmother who had been a brick wall for decades\nWhen I started to work on this side of it and figure boy if I could find out about this just are in fact I stumbled upon a record that mentioned the name saloon\nIn a record that also contain my great great grandmother and going wait a minute that was the name and aunt ... notes so I started tracking this woman\nAnd then found that the sister and from a result of that she lived longer than my great great grandmother to a point where the death certificate started carrying the names of the parents in New York City so\nWhen my great great grandmother died in Brooklyn and Eighteen Seventy nine there was no such place for the names of the parents but by Nineteen hundred their work\nAnd so the gave the name of the sisters parents which of course where the parents of my second great grandmother\nAnd when I found the questioning of the sister I got the maiden name of the mother and then was able to find all the children that were Christian including my own second great grandmother so that took me back not only that you and\nThe name of the mother and then was able to find all the children that were Christian including my own second great grandmother so\nThat took me back not only that generation but also one more generation to the parents of my great great grandmother mother so it was really useful to find the sister and not just work on the direct line\nCan't exactly because each child in the family has the potential of creating records that are going to give us the answers that we're looking for like\nLike you said that one sibling who last long enough to live into an era where they have really good death records and gave you that clue that you needed to move back another generation but if you had focused solely on your direct ancestor you might still be\nBeating your head against that brick wall I think you're right to sue went back over to London and and it was just very different it's always hard to to cross the pond I think\nYeah and when you do have a situation where you're wanting to across the pond you need to do as much research as you can on the side of the up and that includes researching that extended family because you're going to need all of the clues that you can\nCan make sure that you're researching the right person over and the other country and not just someone with the same name\nBoy I think you hit it right on the head and you know Amy one of the other side of researching the siblings is the fact that sibling stories often have to do with your direct ancestors do you find some distant cousins that might have some oral history or some stories in their lines you could discover some stories and their concern in your people\nDirectly which I think would be really important\nOh definitely and I think sometimes when we're thinking about doing an oral history or you know just talking to someone in the family you know we hear the advice often and it is good advice to approach that people in the older generation you know if you're fortunate enough to have somebody\nIn a generation further back than you are\nBut sometimes I think we get so focused on generation being that direct ancestor like well you know my my grand my grandmother is and still living so I Can't interview her but could I interview her sister\nWho is still living sure you know could I interview her brother\nAnd I think we also need to expand it a little bit thinking about like you said thinking about those cousins I'm actually the youngest of twelve grandchildren and my older cousins have completely different memories of our grandparents than what I have sure\nGrandpa died when I had just turned six so I have just a precious few memories of him but in talking to my cousins you know I hear the story about how every year he dressed up as Santa Claus\nAnd hear the stories of what he would do around the house and just how jovial he was like oh you know kind of makes me a little sad that I didn't get to know him better but\nI think we need to pull out some of those stories from people even within our own generation but who have a different perspective on things that that we have and things that we've experienced because no two people are going to see the event exactly the same\nRight and especially generational right I mean a child that looks at an adult are completely different way than say a sibling or appear or a friend because they experienced them as adults obviously and have that adult like relationship and people are different around children it it's it's fun to hear how they were in their different roles within life\nRight and I think it's so neat if you can find someone who knew your ancestor younger\nFor roles within life\nRight and I think it's so neat if you can find someone who knew your ancestor younger than you remember that yeah\nYou know I I look at pictures of my dad and it's like wow dad\nOr you know why do\nYou want and you had [laughter]\nAnd talking to people who knew him when he was in high school or when he was just starting a business it's something that obviously I Would never be able to experience for hair and sometimes you know even though I can still ask dad different things that's interesting to get someone else's perspective\nWe're no kidding and and the other side of this is is that dad doesn't necessarily remember all these other things you know how it goes everybody has long collect a piece of memory somewhere but you know really what we're getting down to here is that no person is an island\nAnd they have experience is essentially in relating or having experiences with other people and when you can find those people who can share those memories you can get some just golden stories and it's really fun also when they disagree [laughter] oh yeah [laughter] totally and\nYou get together with my two sisters and we start talking it's like well now here's what happened now this is how it\nHappened and the third one\nAt trying to figure out okay which one of these really is correct\nAnd usually it's a little bit out of each one because as you said we all have a different perspective on things and we all have just different memories how we remember thanks what was important to us at the time can also affect how we remember it\nAnd you never know what you're going to come up with when you start getting sideways with your family and work on those sibling lines and find their stories and also find their records great stuff Amy thanks so much thank you\nShe's Amy Johnson crow you can follow her at Amy Johnson crow dot com lots to think about their and coming up next to have you ever wondered how your ancestors did coming across the ocean what were the stories they experienced what ship or they on what happened during that journey\nWill David Allan Lambert the chief genealogists in the New England historic Geneva logical society American ancestors dot org is going to talk about that with it you know coming up next to an extreme genes\nAnd boy mhm [noise] [noise] [noise]\n[noise]\n[noise] the all new radio jak combat is available now it's a totally new experiences with listening at your fingertips and we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nRight and not everybody came into the port of New York I mean you think of Ellis Island they mean before Ellis Island is you know castle guard hassle garden you there are other ports\nBoston Philadelphia Portland Maine I mean all the way early ... white and I mean the ... the personnel as tracing their research and thought that their ancestor was going to come into New York and it was New Orleans New Orleans\nAnd and that's to me is a mind blower I mean it's rare but it\nDoes happen had turned on the wrong boat you [laughter] I thought you said knew you had that it was New Orleans ticket folded rice and the other side [laughter] and it was\nThe language barrier occasionally yeah maybe that was the case but nonetheless they had to find their way north pretty quickly\nSo I I guess our listeners if you have stories about your family coming over and it's not obviously written in the passenger list it's not written and the naturalization record have you written it down if not why not write so important share it with your kids I mean if you're an immigrant yourself and you're listening\nHow did you get here sure you make him on a plane maybe ... come on on a boat and write it down first hand recollections of yourself or your parents or grandparents that you know that's a golden treasurer genealogy\nAnd you know we were talking to Amy Johnson crow a little bit earlier about getting sideways with your family interviewing siblings and aunts and uncles not your directs themselves maybe they're gone but a lot of those stories will live with those people\nTrue and you have to preserve this we have such great technology now\nAnd the records of the ships in the military ships and their photographs to I Know ancestry has a lot of the photographs of the ships that brought our ancestors\nIs is a great book that's still in print called ships of our ancestors which you can use something as simple as we can ... you\nJust put in the name of the vessel I mean you may find that there are more than one vessel over the years with the same name of your ship I mean how many may flowers have there been right I mean so that's the type of thing you can find an image of it or if you have an elderly relatives and you know that they're the one that came over even as a child get the story in ...\nSo that's the type of thing you can find an image of it or if you have an elderly relatives and you know that they're the one that came over even as a child get the story and pass it on you know and it it's so important is something that once these stories are lost their last forever\nThat's it and you know I think a lot of people it's amazing to me because I've always embrace these stories\nIt's amazing to me how many of these stories are lost you know the ... thing I often hear from people when I talk to them is oh I Wish I had asked that question oh I Wish I had known at that time you know what how much I Would miss this but you grow into it\nAll right I mean even as a child when I interviewed my grandmother who was alive until I was eleven I mean I asked the birth marriage and death questions what field into a chart I heard other stories like the one about her dad beyond the whaling ship so that's kind of a vessel story and its own right\nBut I don't have any specifics but you don't know what her parents did or did not tell her sure so sometimes it's lost the generation before the one that you're interviewing yeah\nThere's so many what other sources are there David to find out about ships of of the ancestral\nObviously if you're ancestor applies for citizenship you get the date of a rival and generally the port and then all you have to do is look at the manifest in so many of these are on line now sure between ancestry and uh things families searches put online for free\nYou can get into so many of them the Ellis Island website castle garden you can go on and search for people kind of combined really isn't it should be it is and like I say it just knowing the difference between the two when you go to get your vote across to Ellis Island remember where you're getting your ferry from\nIs where they were before I was at right now that are at the very south into Manhattan Island and that's the battery\nThe other thing you can use as newspapers if you know that somebody came down on a sailboat from Canada as some of my family did look at the local papers and see the arrivals and you'll see the boats arrived or maybe even ... find an ad for your ancestors

I think another doctor\nIt's absolutely may as\nWell this is going to be a change for Dr Bonnie said but she wants to know when the technical side how before logging on and greeting a pack a patient can choose to make sure the lighting is right at the camera looks good she looks good on camera before she jumps in and starts talking to a patient yeah because you don't want to\nLook bad no no you have to look you know body you\nHave to look hot\n[laughter] yes yes uh this is going to be quite a transition going from a brick and mortar office to my home office where I can either use my Mac laptop\nOr even my eye pad and iPhone right [noise] yeah so um I just didn't know if there was a way that I can do is ... feet check\nTo see you know if the lighting is okay maybe the background the position of the camera I Know you're supposed to look into the eye of the camera and not the actual screen writing things like that so I did I wanted to know what I can do to prepare before I actually get out and start thinking\nWell you know the big thing is is that we want to make sure there's a good light on you okay\nAnd in Chicago you have sunny days and you have cloudy days right yes and you have a cold winter days I've been there like a ... so I'm the best case scenario is that you get what's called a ring light I don't know if you've heard of this\nAnd it's a it is a rank and uh I can put a link to one for you that I Would recommend free over at Amazon dot com\nAnd so what does it has it's for\nA facial ... like portraits of people use that for it's also when you're on when you're using a webcam is that you have a tendency to be washed out okay\nWith the ring light is exactly what it is is that it's going to illuminate your face okay\nAnd so that this way people are better able to see you and you'll actually you will actually look better lit up than dark a lotta people say oh no I Lived veteran or dark restaurant\nNothing not so much just from K now when you're faces illuminated what's in the background will appear darker OK okay\nAnd so you being a doctor\nI Would want to see your credentials on the wall\nMeaning I I Want to see those diplomas you know what I mean even though I Can't I won't be able to read them\nI Want to see all your awards I Want to know where you went to medical school I mean I I'd like to be able to look that closely but I can tell what they are right okay and of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to go you don't strike me as a person but you know we've interviewed people will be for like the Skype\nAnd of course you want to get rid of any junk behind you to you don't strike me as that person but you know we've interviewed people before like this guy you know for jobs here\nAnd you know and you look and they have this like there was a hoarders behind them and you're like ooh what is that pile that you like to write the weekly and all that up\nNow there are ways when you have face time for example that you can hit a button this was going to be hard but what I Would do is I Would just\nRecord say a couple of seconds and\nThen you don't have to worry about just taking a picture so if you've been to record some video of yourself for thirty seconds\nThe big thing too that a lot of people don't realize body is that you want to smile OK okay and because when you smile you look welcoming and\nI'm sure you've done that you know where it's hard to deliver bad news but you might have a little bit of a smile you know raise a because there's a whole side of\nI mean I have a lot of friends who are doctors and I I hear a lot of the bad story but I also hear the good stories you know yeah and um but you know so being letting your personality comes through have you ever done this before\n[noise] uh only and Web in ours but not actually as a patient doctor thing\nThis is so cool I'm so excited frail um the ring lights are about\nSixty bucks okay and it makes like I said it makes a total difference you're going to love what you see when you record a couple of minutes of yourself because at that point you're going to say yes\nA little extra blush sometimes works too when you're on a webcam because uh you seem to get a little bit washed out even if you do have this ... and again thank you for your call\nHey speaking of let's talk about\nTherapy works relief like many of us she

phone calls come right up [noise]\nStores for everything digital digital got is Kim [noise]\nAgain forty AM ...\nAs a business owner I rely on del small business technology advisors\nYou wait tables and I also waited tables and when I was at a a shoe at a sports bar downtown Tempe when you wait tables and you're a waitress you suddenly appreciate all the work\nThat somebody that\nI understand but that's not their role at bat so if you're at target would you tips the person who was checking you out at target not the guy who was checking out the person that I was working the register no of course you want\nBut and bad but as ... okay but sometimes they do like I was at the gas station the guy but Aaron my tires and it and he was using square and I got gas and he said\nIn and said like ten percent for air and the tires and I'm like am I supposed to tip the gas station guy now what does that but you're absolutely right there are some places where it's I don't think just because they handed me a muffin\nThat if I mean that's part of me going there you know there's a a there's the Starbucks I was at the Starbucks in Honolulu and I'll never forget\nThat ... percent like eight hundred dollars or something or ... had to tip\nJars okay and so you know not only can you tip on the receipt but they actually had tip jars right one was one said for all you Android people and the other ones had for\nAll your iPhone people and the iPhone tip jar with like overflowing [laughter] and the Android One\nDidn't have anything yeah I was at a a video game thing and they said if you think the X. box sucks\nTrip here if you think the PlayStation ... it's just a ploy is just like you said before giving people out of their money\nBut how about this one this is a little different when we order or my sister's kids came over for dinner or something like ... get a bunch of barbecue so we go on Amazon restaurants and a bunch of barbecue and I get the total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars and I was like that's a lot more than I was expecting right\nRight a bunch of barbecue and I give a total and it's like a hundred and twenty five dollars and I was like that's a lot more than I was expecting right they automatically added on twenty five per cent tip after also charging me a delivery fee okay that that's really tough because they don't even ask you\nYeah and you know ... isn't a tore us for that and also overeat\nBecause they'll say like pricing search okay\nAnd so they add another five dollars if you order something that's under ten dollars there'll be a small order delivery charge you know or whatever\nMaybe but maybe it's like being a server at one point in my life\nI actually will tip the whole foods or the\nAmazon Prime driver or whatever it is I'll actually add more like he's like okay I got a whole foods delivery yesterday and it was probably\nI think it was like a hundred and fifty dollars\nWe got two things yeah I had seven and broccoli [laughter] which is probably about it and some sushi okay\nAnd if the tip was a recommended to was twelve dollars\nCake and so so I was ten percent okay I ... I gave the guy sixteen I gave them an extra\nFour or five I Wonder what I mean the research has got to be out there but this worked otherwise the apps that are doing this the squares and stuff like that big wouldn't included well\nAnd because you know remember they're making a percentage of the total even on a tip yes okay because they charge square and the other one said two point nine percent two and a half percent of as a transaction fee of the total amount right okay so if they can get that told and thinking about that so they can get the total amount\nUp by five dollars I Would think the tip of the dollar is no no no ... you pay the whole transaction than what the ... what is that what is the bottom line transaction\nThen you have to pay a fee for them collecting the money and doing things like that and ... I'm Still not ... well it is hard it is hard and\nYou know I I don't know maybe I'm maybe I'm just a nicer more generous person than you are regional maybe about uh the I think that you know but I but sometimes it is kind of awkward\nYou know tipping again for just like what is normally\nAnd what we should be considered like just part of the experience like somebody handing you a napkin so here's ten percent I'm just instead of having them after images use the cash that you're expecting me to get him to like my ... something like that\n[noise] All right let me tell you something over the years of epson printers may have earned my trust which is why I'm a committed user and you'll see what I mean\nYou have to experience the economical Epps an ego tanks forty seven fifty it's a fantastic wireless all in one corner loved this friend is my printer choice\nOr for a couple of reasons well first of all it's cartridge free don't you hate\nBuying printer ink cartridges oh my gosh what's in there anyway golden no colored IQ but the F sin ego taint forty seven fifties cartridge free comes with\nUp to two years of vague riding the box that's enough to print up to eleven thousand color pages that's the equivalent of thirty a cartridge that's now if I were to run to the store and buy thirty cartridge that's yeah do the math it would cost me about Fifteen hundred dollars was ego take you easily refill the printers ink tank in seconds\nThey go take a Compaq space saving printer that's truly cartridge free and it's available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now epson dot com slash east coast\nA pack space saving printer that's truly cartridge free and it's available everywhere\nYou can learn more right now epson dot com slash eco tank him as a CEO Ga and take him and for a limited time between now and November first journey get free overnight shipping whenever used to promote ego tank him a check out when you buy any ego tank runner so whenever I talk\nAbout his friend and people are always sending me emails you know what was the model number or how can I learn more about it\nAnd you really say cartridge free with up to two years of big right in the box yes I said all that here's the Web address SBN dot com slash ego tank him once again that's epson dot com slash ego tank you are right\nWe have a letter from our listener mail that we're going to be answering this hour it's all about anonymous browsing and there's a browser there by the name of toward T.
