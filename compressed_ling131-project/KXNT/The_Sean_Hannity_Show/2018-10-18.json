because the Washington Post has asserted\nThat President Trump's administration is actively giving cover to the Saudis are trying to help the Saudis in covering up the story or coming up with a\nCover story on an explanation but a very unlikely other sources saying no\nAnd I I Want to get into that and just a second we only have a couple of moments left in the segments are hanging out so Washington Post who could show you run for their saying a Trump Administration kind of helping us out he's out on this jam\nOr but another source which you might not expect is sort of coming to the defense of President Trump and the administration I'm going to get into that and just a second\nSo uh this Mohammed bin psalm on M. B. S. as Lindsey Graham likes to call them the Saudi crown prince again an absolute power over there he's running the show he runs virtually every important aspect to that country the military national security intelligence uh it's it was his economic\nSummit being held in Riyadh that everyone's pulling out\nSo at least seven of the Fifteen Saudis who flew into turkey that day that to show you went missing\nHave long standing ties to the crown prince and even work as part of his security you know some are military officers summer intel officers one is the government's own hand picked doctor in charge of forensics he was the guy that brought\nMe the bones song to the party\nOf course this thing was premeditated they plan to take your mind when who for some votes off I mean come on and then I you have more heart a dual on Xi's mood for him\nAh from that day they have them at a hotel in Istanbul they have them outside the consulate\nThey have met the airport but guess what they have them going into the conflict and they have a time stamp of him coming out so they have moved crab on CCTV\nGoing in to the Saudi conflict at nine fifty five in the morning on October second that's when\nA Jamal to show he disappeared went in for this and yeah I have this conversation with my wife last night I should have gone into the Saudis are constantly you know he's a dissident he's outspoken\nDesperate to get his divorce papers and then his approval to marry his new wife from the Saudi kingdom\nBut I mean should have known that that was a dangerous spot to go in I I'm guessing the back of his mind or that he must have\nBut I mean they have a time stamp of this this top security agent for the crown prince they've got 'em going at nine fifty five and then they have him leaving about three and a half hours later\nPlenty of time to interrogate this member a et cetera none of this is going to happen without the express written consent of major league baseball and of the crown prince there's no doubt about it they're still rogue operation here they they thought they could get away with this the crown prince ... won and its\nPrince there's no doubt about it they're still rogue operation here they they thought they could get away with this the crown prince centers going swan and his top security guy was there for this kind of odd that strains any suggestion that oh we have no idea what happened to give me a break now\nAs far before I go to phones on this and I got to move on on the Trump threats to close the border and use even military or\nA assets I Want to get into that here on just a second but as far as this interesting little media it's worse for the past couple of days we have the Washington Post and they've asserted that the Trump Administration has been pro actively\nHelping the Saudi royal family come up with this ah this cover story on how to wiggle out of this whole cause show the mess and then the administration\nUm try to help them come up with some type of plausible deniability here uh that's the Washington Post busts CNN yeah as I said CNN\nIs\nSort of coming to the president's a defensive coming to the age of the president's a Washington Post they are tremendous ration cover story helping the Saudis out but CNN is offering a whole different scenario here\nWhich reflects\nWell on the White House\nNow they're thinking of the Washington Post is that Trump and palm pay or giving suggestions\nAnd more importantly I give them the Saudis time to get their story straight I don't know I don't care how much time they have\nThat this is I think that they ain't getting out of the post reporting indicates that the same or narrative at this point is this interrogation that went bad that uh\nThat the Saudis or the crown prince only signed off on a questioning and interrogation not of a a murdering a an acid bath or a or this or you know and I said this numbering beheading whenever\nA which again\nI I just I Know buddy ... especially the one of the top security guys for the person who's going to take any matter like this into his own hands without the express consent as the prince not you know knowing about this so I'm [noise]\n[noise] [noise] the claim is always just walk through the this is what the Saudis are are modeling apparently it was just an interrogation we didn't sign off on you know dissolving human asset and and\nHacking his fingers off one by one at apparently this was capture on audio which leads us to believe that the Turkish must have had the Saudi conflict\nBugged well the church or Turkish they need to release this audio I don't know why they're holding on to this and have have U.S officials have been given the Saudi has pumped pale and the White House\nAnd top intelligence officials have we heard this audio or that's still a question\nUh to be determined now was of course it would be a massive mistake for this administration to assist with a cover up or ally of this magnitude and I just don't think that's going to happen\nYou know I you know Hillary Clinton or trying to uh you know cover for the Obama administration by you know trying to sell us on that anti Muslim video as the precursor the the ignition point for Ben guys it give me a break\nA lot I so I I don't think the Trump Administration is going to get themselves into this kind of trouble here\nFor guys give me a break I'm On a so I I don't think the Trump Administration is going to get themselves into this kind of trouble here now\nThese implausible cover stories they they don't work out very well historically I I don't think it's going to happen here so the Washington Post is trying to suggest like I said that the Trump Administration trying to assist the Saudis but CNN\nThey have a different story CNN has different reporting giving assistance to the Trump Administration and again with the Washington Post is asserting\nCNN CNN is reporting this here's a quote from CNN clumps a source familiar with compares Tuesday meeting with Saudi Arabia and crown prince Mohammed bin some on telling CNN that the smiling photo op\nBetween the two should not be read as an indication that the meeting was friendly instead\nPalm pale told been saw him on in no uncertain terms\nThat he had to own the situation and that every fact is going to get out\nAccording to ah the source they have who added the smiles between the two ended when that photo op ended\nAnd we're also hearing that the administration was not happy that that's how it was portrayed a but listen you you don't don't give the media a photo op in order to you know throw that back out of ... so here CNN is giving the administration some coverage here\nWashington Post is not I tend to think that that reporting is accurate\nAnd the Trump Administration is going to do the right thing on the story I uh I got to move on to other things I Want to grab a couple of phone calls first and then a military sense of the border to stop crossings\nSummer up in arms oh my God we got to address this so we will coming up in just a bit here let's grab some phones are eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide number here on Smith\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine that's how you get on the program let's start with Margaret in Ocala, Florida\nThat's a horse country John Travolta country hello Margaret Iran Smith go ahead\nHi how are you doing well I was just calling I'm I'm not saying\nThat these people didn't murder that guy and they probably did but I'm just saying it happened and they got a video and audio of it that how come at that place of mud how come nobody did know ahead of time if they weren't going to do because surely they talk about it in there\nWell the cause and there was a report out we talked about this yesterday that the actual uh the the counsel in the the embassy or the the Saudi conflict that that they had a diplomat\nUh apparently allegedly told when they started to torture a show he allegedly the chief diplomat\nOr he said that you can't do this in here\nSo I I don't think he would I don't think he was technically on board and the goon squad was sent them because they knew he was going to be there for the paperwork this was clearly ... premeditated I just don't know I don't think this was\nTechnically discussed inside the walls this was formulated in Saudi Arabia the goon squad was centered on two different flights and\nAh the show he met his fate inside those walls I I don't think that\nThis necessarily would have been overheard inside or if they have the place bond and it seems that they have audio how else would have it have gotten out the story about oh right accorded on his apple watch technologically that that doesn't work\nIt seems that they have audio how else would have it have gotten out the story about oh rank quarters on his apple watch\nTechnologically that that doesn't work you can't record on

[noise]\nAlso\nShort time ago the president's Trump Andrews was asked or anything he could tell us about the shouting match apparently between ... and John Kelly the president\nSaid this\nAnd then he moved up [noise] although the one that he sided with both of you\nAnd just again or you know Donna Shalala really\nAnd I you know I could talk about our academic background and and it goes I don't want to waste any more time I just wanted to give it you know some details that there was a protest against below sea and I get a lot of profanity and they were just yelling F policy in English and Spanish and\nI I don't like the profanity although I I I personally a primary source of many people are going to have on many occasions I just you know as far as you know let let the wacko a left let them have those ballots of incivility I just don't think it makes sense\nTo or even though I I Can't stand pillow see I I don't think it it\nReally served as a cause right and to left the left use a crowd using profanity and shouting the F bomb to use that against a those on the rights I mean ... again ... socialism socks that's fine or go after Nancy Pelosi\nThe merits but I I just don't think we need the F bomb but I wanted to play a little bit of an audio eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine a nationwide number here on Smith eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on the show speaking of don't ask you below sea of these campaign events and the president has been doing all these rallies as we head into the mid term a final stretch here we are only a couple of weeks away from the mid term elections\nAnd you know again which way is this going to go to the red white and blue wave and you know who who knows the big question is again voter turnout and there are numerous reports\nFrom around the country that\nThere's still a concern that while there is a whole lot of enthusiasm that both sides have charged you've got immigration obviously you've got the Kavanaugh issue I mean there's you've got the anti Trump crowd on the other side the issue here is\nThat there are ...\nThere's you've got the anti Trump crowd on the other side the issue here is that there are reports coming out that many while maybe energize they don't plan to vote\nIn the mid term elections so I saw this piece um it came from the Houston Chronicle the Houston Chronicle but it looks like it might have been a a wider peace and it just talked about you know this is a dateline on the story was Clarksville, Tennessee\nInterested in the mid term election is that a fever pitch and much of the country of both Democrats and Republicans far more passionate than they've been in more than a decade could this be the year that Tennessee's Montgomery County shows up to votes\nLocated northwest in Nashville along the Kentucky border discount the often has one of the lowest voting rates in the states in a state that often has one of the lowest rates in the country\nAnd in the country that has had one of the lowest rates in the world a traveling other developed nations so it's just an interesting piece that you know and and this is a study on on this particular area but again what remains to be seen as a larger picture\nIs that turn out for the midterms going to be\nSimilar to a presidential election year\nNow I've seen that some of the cable news channels are going to treat the mid term election night they get a tweet that Tuesday night in early November as if it were because of the importance of the midterms\nAnd the hope that that's the Democrats have to hopefully not take back the house of representatives a long shot the Senate or that the the cable networks are going to treat that Tuesday night as if it was a the importance of a presidential election\nSo again voter turnout who's turning out is it going to be a a bus or is it going to be a a boom as far as voter turnout all that you know obviously remains to be seen\nA couple of things you don't want a lightning round a few items here and I thought this was interesting I don't know if you're if you heard the story about big bird retiring well as being burned the character on Sesame Street is saying if the guy inside the big bird outfit\nWho is retiring that's not the story although it's interesting to recognize that the the guy that played big bird is like eighty something years old\nAnd he's now retiring he's a anyone\nHe's eighty one years old and the guy's name is uh is is it's very\nCarol spin E.
