guy is a backgrounds are past\nAh I this is a tough spot I I just can't say look the other way if the Saudis thought thing and that's what it appears in beers they thought they could just get away

I'm ... you know what this one is time step yesterday but then I have\nA I have two stories I've won a from the fifteenth that are now the latest you know all of this there's going to be uh\nIt's time

brought on by changing climate could put beer on the endangered species list\nOh please ... some of the ah the beer experts are saying give me a break you know it's a new study predicting a global beer shortage because of a global warming\nAnd the growth of hops and and and barley and gets [noise] give me a really so now that is that's a new tactic to try to bring beer or lovers into the fold to try to a phone meant that the global warming climate change deal\nSo and then there's pushback you got to buy a bunch of the brewers apparently are now saying\nAh that that this has blown out of proportion yeah or the annual barley yields could fall free to Seventeen percent yeah just like Al Gore said we were at the point and overturn a while I was ... and ... our cities are going to be flooded up\nTo like the second third floor that was going to be one back in like what two thousand two thousand to whatever the the out years ago\nAnd then of course we have that new scare that came out about what two weeks ago that we have Thirteen Years now twenty thirty one or whatever to change course ... reversible\nAll the Chicken Little sky is falling less I Want I Want clean water I Want clean air I mean I I'm a scuba diver I Want clean oceans\nBut again here's the latest round of of the push of a life controlling and throw project global warming scare tactics\nAnd the U.S and its like clockwork it's cyclical [noise]\nEight on and both things ... the the ... these these news stories and these new attempts to scare everyone is cyclical as well it's fairly constant but it does come in cycles and then uh you know the planet heating and the plan of cooling has been cyclical uh [noise]\nFor millions of years for billions of years the plan it's been hot in the plant it's been colder\nCenturies prior to the industrial revolution the planet was warmer than a cold I you know\nI don't want flipping the ramp and pollution I Want to again we we ought to put the least the missions possible into the atmosphere but again I\nYou know there's the same tactic just it's it's like rings and repeat it's like a shampoo bottle instruction ah first ladies okay there was a a incidents on the first lady's jet\nSmoke filled the cabin earlier today millennia Trump was on the way to Philadelphia from a joint base Andrews she was on board um\nEssentially an air force to type plane or pump pail type plane she was on board one of the seven five seven's\nA there's a a military designation I think it's the sea thirty two hey so can you look up to see thirty make sure I have that right\nAnd see if the sea thirty two is the bowling seven five seven in the military designation anyone that's the the plane she was on the the seven five seven equivalent and she was headed from joint base Andrews the Philly\nAnd the plane turns around because I'll smoke filled the cockpit\nFrom a joint base Andrews to Philly\nAnd the plane turns around because I'll smoke filled the cockpit the plane with us who says I'm going to see thirty to the plane was about ten minutes into flight Secret Service agents suddenly jumped up and they are darted toward the cockpit and the reports from the media on board has that smoke\nIn the cockpit was filtering a you\nKnow through the airplane and then that's what the media has reported there were wet towels given out to the press corps and the other passengers on the plane so their faces could be covered because of a ... a strong burning older burning smell\nNo reports of injuries the plane landed safely about nine to five eastern time this morning and ah the first lady Melania Trump she's on her way to Philly\nA for an event\nTo visit the Thomas Jefferson hospital for a conference on neonatal abstinence syndrome\nAnd that apparently according to a re come news is a ... babies have withdrawal symptoms because of their mother's drug use are particularly narcotics\nSo I'm Glad to hear that everyone aboard the first lady's flight is okay or some type of mechanical malfunctions some type of burning and smoke in the cockpit ate a\nHappens on commercial flights you know luckily not that often but it happened that everyone's just fine I had a couple of other things here on the on the mall or front\nIs the modern pro ... wrapping up I mean the indications are it's getting pretty close there was a report out today in Bloomberg\nThat special counsel Robert Mueller could be getting very close to wrapping up the Russia investigation and it could actually result in his report being sent to the department of justice\nBy this time next month\nAnd again the indication that we're getting close is when you start hearing about the interviews or their request for interviews for individuals at the highest level of the chain\nFor instance the stories that have come out that the the uh Mahler team is trying to work out the questions that the Trump will answer and of course that's the top you get an interview\nA President Trump last that's\nGoing to be less than the chain because that's how they put their investigation together so the implication is that\nWe're getting close to the end and it could actually be by mid November So after the midterm elections things have been very quiet because\nAs is typical is type of event ego radio silence and that's what happens if you have the the modern ... they've really been in radio silent mode since the end of August first of September and that's that sixty day window\nPrior to an electric in this case the midterms and they didn't want to interfere which I think is the right thing to do now\nOr the report from Bloomberg says the deputy attorney general and the guy in charge of the modern investigation Rod Rosenstein\nAnd new Trump best money or wants to get this thing done which makes perfect sense or after the midterms are the fate of a whole lot of folks including Rosenstein Jeff Sessions or could be ... by a threat I Would imagine sessions has gone after the midterms according to the Bloomberg report [noise]\nMahler reports will focus exclusively on his findings or\nAccording to the Bloomberg report the Mahler reports will focus exclusively on his findings or\nLack there of concern in collusion and or obstruction now has been the case here\nAs soon as it's been known for quite some time pundits from both sides are Republican Democrat as well as most legal experts feel that obstruction poses a much greater threat to President Trump\nAnd the inner circle than any collusion or conspiracy but all this remains to be seen on what actually and I would imagine we have no clue as to the depths", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "17"}
