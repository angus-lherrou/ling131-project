night's Greg is in Baton Rouge Louisiana and hello Greg you're on snippets\nOh thank you so Marc God Bless you um yeah I just want to talk about a Trump or he just get out there last night and he basically uh am I Am are you are on loud and\nClear he's ah he just talk on our land on age just flat out say what the deal live\nAnd uh everybody jumping on his back a Republicans included and it's like good lord we know we are in a real bad way to that are like oh I only did was hit the nail right on the head ...\nOr ... hold on to say I'll let me let me respond I got about thirty seconds before the bottom of the outbreak here so the president was very measured last week you know talking about uh her being a credible of individual and she thought you'll find lady uh uh and\nThen the about faces the rally I'm just saying from a strategic standpoint you're trying to get flights and Murkowski and Collins to sign on and vote yes for Kavanaugh and here they are now screaming at the president\nSaying that he shouldn't have attacked or like that at the rally last night that's what I'm saying back in a minute\nThe latest from McCain eggs in the news desk in sixty seconds on news talking forty AM K eggs and the\nThe following is not an actor but a real life story from trinity debt management and\nI had a lot of credit card debt and I couldn't pay my bills I was feeling so bad I got to a point where I needed some help so I reached out and contacted trinity\nThat strategy I don't think last night was intelligently applied at all\nAnd then we have of course the the red state Democrats we've got Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota we have a Joe Manchin of West Virginia and again those are votes that could help push Kevin all over the finish line as well so you know the question is\nAnd before I go back to your phone calls you what is\nThe endgame here what is the president's goal\nAs far as getting Kavanaugh across the finish line\nBecause again the comments last night by the president will not helpful\nFor that particular goal so is it possible that the president has concluded that the fights over Kavanaugh is may be worth more in the midterms than actually having\nJudge Kavanaugh on the Supreme Court is that a a possibility is there a chance that Trump and his advisors in strategist think that he can get some more mileage by you know Jimmy up the base getting them out to vote in the midterms\nThan continuing the fight against the Democrats who are doing everything they can and said so from the very beginning\n\nIf they want to do everything to destroying the rail and make sure that Kavanaugh was not a a a confirm Supreme Court justice or maybe that's the strategy here I I don't think it is I still think they want Kavanaugh confirmed but was that I got to throw everything you know possible\nOr against the or the wall here I'm\nJust I'm just a little baffled here again of well a little bit of the schizophrenia in how the president was very measured and then I was taking a different turn\nAs we get closer to a potential vote for cabinet I just I Do not understand that I I Can't figure it out you know prior to the allegations made against Kavanaugh back what you know a month ago when uh the confirmation seems like a done deal totally inevitable\nYou know the base was acting like it was\nA no no they didn't know the issue here and there was also a concern that the base might not turn out for the midterms because they weren't buying the fact that Democrats were in a potential position to take back the house of representatives so\nThey weren't that energized the base wise and this was a big concern\nThe house of representatives so\nUh they weren't that energized the base was this was a big concern internal polling inside at the er or and see\nA suggested this that they were very concerned about the very active base Trump voter in voting in the mid term elections so maybe this is an opportunity in a is there a chance that Trump is now using\nCapital as a pawn to energize the base to make sure that the house of representatives is still secure for the Republicans was anything is possible these days\nSo I'm with that let's go back to some calls a then we've got to get into this this polygraph issue and the ex boyfriend of Dr Ford\nAgain it is amazing I don't know if we've ever seen this degree of he said she said and all the different factions in different layers that keep changing it's it's absolutely amazing\nLet's go to a dog in Las Vegas Nevada Doug ... you're on ... welcome to the program\nThank you for taking my call hey ...\nWhy did she send the literature her congresswoman if you are so worried about keeping it secret\n[noise] well yeah I heard something secret you don't send it to some it you know is normally kept well again they went to set up more and more that people can see through it\nMy dog goes and I I obviously feel that this was all part of some master plan to keep capital from the court ... well hang\nOn a minute so you have Dr forty sent the letter originally to her congresswoman and California\nAnd then it was given to a Dianne Feinstein who's the ranking member Democrat on the\nSenate Judiciary committee where uh she claimed she didn't leave some of the leak the damn thing I Want an investigation out there who leaked the letter\nBut doctors originally ... Dr ... originally said that she wants to remain anonymous and of course I said from the very beginning that it's not going to be anonymity here\nThat were absolutely going to fight and sure enough a couple of days later we started to find out that it was Dr Ford and her identity was revealed Doug thanks for the call let's go to Mary in St Clair Michigan Hello Mary you're on Smith\nHi love your show Dr for I lied to the Senate she said she had two doors down in front of our how it's not fair but she rented out stays in her how it's also she said she was afraid to fly that she has taken business trips and their cases all over the world and then nearly as that's our parents\nAnd also Dr Farida voted for Hillary and she was a political activist for the Democrat Party so I don't believe that she lied to a lot to the Senate\nI wanted to say merry I don't think that I Would subscribe to the fact that she was an activist now her attorney that Deborah cats\nWho was recommended to her by Dianne Feinstein office now that they ever catch the attorney for Ford is an activist and she showed up at rallies with there's news footage of her talking about resisting the Trump presidency ah but the other things that you said I'm pretty much in agreement with\nAnd there are a lot of inconsistencies not just with our story from back in the Nineteen eighties when she's made these claims from but also in our current life there there was some inconsistencies or the door the Google interns and and again a fear of flying to come to the hearing but she apparently has no problem getting all over the place\nMary thanks for the call let's grab another Mary\nBack to back Mary's let's grab this Mary's in Chicago hello Mary\nHi I just wanted to say I don't think our president did anything wrong I Am glad what he said he just spoke the truth\nTrying to say I don't think our president is anything wrong I Am glad what he said he just spoke the truth she is nothing but a liar liar her two brothers are lawyers but Feinstein got or a lawyer\nBut hey Mary I'm not arguing I have a lot of problems with Dr Ford and I think that she's lied or misstated I have been suspect since the beginning of the motivations of her the story the recollection of events I I have a lot of questions\nMary I'm coming from the standpoint of the the goal is to get Kavanaugh if confirmed to the Supreme Court right\nYes and I do believe he will be\nSo Mary ... why would the president not stick with hey you can talk about Dr Ford and the inconsistencies in the story but it was just it was the tone last night and tried to turn it into a bit or an act\nA law that that that that's our president that's why we elected him he helped each the truth well commonsense\nWell Mary last week somebody had spoken to him about being very measured in tempered on Dr Ford\nAnd and obviously worked but he changed his tune in demeanor last night and if you are alienating the Republicans that we need to confirm Kavanaugh\nI I just don't think that's a very smart move Mary thanks for the call and it was you know Mary's mentality ... I'm a I'm not chastising Mary but that sort of the mentality of a rally crowd where yeah\nAnd so there are plenty of Trump supporters an echo it I'm just pointing out to get capital confirmed there is a better chess game that you can play here that's what I'm ... I'm suggesting Scott as next in pace Florida and hello Scott Iran Smith\nGoing um my biggest problem is mostly ... left but they all do it uh is when they describe the lady testimony or become automatic oh she was so great she came through and she told her truth\nThat's not even a thing you do not everybody don't get their own truth there's only one true you may never get to it but there's only one that's not even a thing I Wish they were saying that there is no or truth is\nIt's also it's not it's also the the belief that everything she's saying is the gospel everything that she's saying is one hundred percent certified and verified and was like a videotape of VHS play back\nOf that Nineteen eighty two incidents when in fact it's very muddled it's very muddy and we just don't know what the details aren't she can't even remember all the details but everyone has presented her\nAnd they they they're putting her up on a pedestal like it is the absolute certified fat that everything you know it's happened the way that she claims that I'm Sorry they're just a lot of discrepancies Scott thanks for the call I when we get back I Want to just ... and if you on hold hang out we'll go ... go back to calls in a bit\nBut I Want to before we uh and our number one I just want to lay out the initial story here with the latest he said she said on the polygraph issue so uh we'll get to that next year on Smith I Want to welcome a brand new sponsor to the show is ... galore now\nI'm In the process right now of ordering new blinds for\nOur new place and they've got a couple of windows that we need printed and the timing is perfect here biggest blood tests\nOur new place right and they got a couple of windows that we need treated and the timing is perfect here biggest blinds galore dot com was the first place or where you could buy custom window treatments online so they were the first and because of that they know what they're doing\nThe all new radio dot com app is available now it's a totally new experience that puts listening at your fingertips we made it easier than ever to access the radio stations you love now will save your favorite stations and\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are near radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone\nFor anywhere\nFrom the justice of heart ... studios K MTA up north Las Vegas game X.

T. and you never know what you're going to get anywhere and saw checking some of the responses on Twitter and a lot of folks agree with me\nThat the president just didn't need to go in the mockery department at the rally Mississippi last night but I Am you know some others that are like oh ... you're a rhino oh yeah I'm a writer though because I Want to see Kavanaugh confirmed and we don't want to alienate\nThose that are needed to confirm Kavanaugh like Carlos Murkowski and Jeff Flake\nAnd all three have not chastised the president for the the mocking tone on Dr Ford was I made your problem the doctor for\nI I but I suspect that but nothing\nUh outrageous who's going to emit from his investigation and it was only ...\nI I just think that that I I Believe that probably he's reminding people if I did vote against them if it does look like maybe she's not credible and they vote against it that maybe it's political\nOr a we've all seen those pictures of dying Feinstein uh pushing a metallic ... you know against the wall and the ... and hallway you know run\nBut so I think that he's just remind people uh sometimes a little harsh and the wife says fine but [noise] but uh\nI think that there was a time was Sherry there's a time for Trump to be Trump and there's a time when you need to use a little honey and not to golf those on your side you know even Lindsey Graham hey sharing the Fox and friends folks this morning poll Trump he was wrong\nI mean ... all over they if a slobber fence Fox and friends they slobber over the over Trump from slobber silver Fox and friends they said the Trump was wrong and what he did\nA with a mockery hey you can tell the story I Trump tell the facts all the inconsistencies the problems it just in the tone in the fashion\nThat's where I don't want to have any additional obstacles in a capital a potential vote on the ... that's what I'm saying and even Lindsey Graham Lindsey Graham with that stunning amazing stellar defense attacking the Democrats on the Senate Judiciary committee\nOr has been very supportive of Kevin on the nomination even Lindsey Graham is saying is the president went a little bit too far Sherman thanks for the call ... Cynthia next in Jacksonville, Florida hello Cynthia you're on Schmidt\nHey thanks to add a couple of things\nFirst of all we all who love Trump at least most of the time he gets excited and I think that the prosecutor knew the answers um to a lot of the question she asked I think she was found in on the flying why the\nFear of being in a small space lie\nAnd oh there's no doubt there's no doubt that the Republicans had some intel that they passed along to the prosecutors no doubt about it\nBut but with so much at stake\nTrump needs to just quiet town and respectful even if he knew about the letter from her boyfriend and all that and it probably really kicked him off because what the Democrats have done to Kavanaugh is disgusting more deplorable than the lowest of deplorable\nI I Can't disagree with you I've touted exactly what you said but it's just acting at the right\nWay up the right time that's what I think Trump gets all ginned up at these things and I think commonsense sometimes uh you know ... see him or or exits his body exits his brain and I just do the wrong time for it to happen simply\nI agree with you and I see it shocked\nI listen to talk about it you can talk about the facts in a more a factual presentation with out the the acting or the performance that's where he's getting the pushback from even members of his own party\nThat won a seat Kavanaugh confirmed hang up more ship coming up [noise]\nThe Smith show\nWhich one you saw me forty fifty [noise]\n\nYou'll see one or earnings go up we earn more\nSo if you've been caught a squeaking board marker [noise]\nEasily one of the most annoying office noises there is right up there with the woman who taps or Penn like she's doing a drum solo at a ...
