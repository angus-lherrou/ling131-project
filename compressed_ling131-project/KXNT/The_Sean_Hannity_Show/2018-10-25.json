just you know as we've been educated and we we understand you know racism and and what has been offensive you know and I I don't it's not because anyone shoveling that down I'm I'm told what to believe I genuinely find it offensive and I don't think Megan Kelly is around\nYou know and I it's not because anyone shoveling that down I'm I'm told what to believe no I I genuinely find it

on a on a life in a mind of its own and it's going to do or in over at the NBC now here are a couple of stories that I pulled and I'm not see all the you know what let me play the audio or just as a refresher\nOn to chunks of audio from a Megan Kelly's program from I think this was was this one Tuesday or where you know It's Tuesday and they're talking about Halloween costumes\nAnd ah this was the portion where they were talking about the black face and this was the start of what God Megan Kelly into hot water\n[laughter] I mean you do get in trouble if you are a white person who puts on or a black person that puts on white Halloween like that that was a kid that was okay as long as you're addressing other character is\nNo [noise] I don't think it was him are okay I I don't think we had quite the sensitivity now when she was a kid Megan Kelly I think is a little bit younger than me\nSo we were doing Halloween back in the Nineteen seventies by the early eighties you know I was I was Thirteen and Seventy nine I was fourteen and Nineteen eighty so I was pretty much done was Halloween but you know for me the Halloween the heyday of Halloween you know trick or treating him\nIn a you know the menu at New York and going around my neighborhood off of town line road and our go place\nYou know back then you know that was the heyday from it or would have been Nineteen Seventy two Seventy three Seventy four Seventy five\nSeventy six\n[noise] and then we moved to Virginia Beach or Christmas Seventy six and then I had a couple of years of trick or treating there but I never wanted to put blackface on but you know the fact that she didn't recognize it yeah that's offensive it's not right and um [noise] you know that's what got her into trouble but if you heard that it was an overt\nI don't think she displayed anything and screamed oh my God ... Megan Kelly is a racist I didn't hear it\nBut it feels like something is offensive to them then you should say it and that's fair game and I had a gun\nOr with the trouble is she didn't recognize that she should understand on all levels that it should be or it is considered offensive and so that was the first clip and then there were she was talking about Diana Ross and one of the real housewives\nDressed up as Diana Ross for Halloween and\nIt was a controversy on the real housewives of New York with ... as she dresses Diana Ross and she made her skin look darker than it really is and people said that that was racist and I felt\nShe wants to look like they interrupt her one day I I don't know how like that got race on Holloway guys walking or I mean it the\nI don't think she really wanted to look like Dana Rochester and in fact as Michael Jackson died\nSo yeah there you have it as a fact is what started this ball rolling and [noise]\nShe should have known better again it wasn't like she ordered the N. word or sent something just unbelievably racially offensive it was the lack of understanding that then opened up this this ah this this little a crack\nAnd it's just expanded and people have piled on NBC a fellow employees fellow colleagues have jumped ... jumped on and here we\nAll piled on NBC a fellow employees fellow colleagues have jump off a jumped on and here we are and are numerous reports are saying here's paid six\nAnd I I haven't had time to look at a so can you see if there's any definitive uh reporting a and at this point from from multiple sources or cause some resources are saying Megan Kelly expected to NBC morning show after this\nOr you know it's been ratings challenged as well a page six earlier today at noon\nHave six from the New York post headline screamed Megan Kelly out after NBC a blackface drum so Megan Kelly is out according to you know noontime today from the New York post\nMegan Kelly is out in the sea following controversial comments she made about black face this week a source told paid six it's such as forty eight hours for Kelly to be cut from the network\nDuring a panel discussion and we just heard the audio or talking about going to get in trouble if you're a white person puts on black face a but it wasn't that way when she was a kid ah oh she's forty seven so she has five years younger than me\nAnd of course we played her apology her Megan ... are on the program a yesterday\nAnd it looks like this is it that she's done you know the big question is sixty nine million dollar contract I read your might tweet from yesterday 'cause I thought this was going to be the case\nAnd I said that is in the eye again paraphrasing might tweet from yesterday I said is NBC or going to use some type of a an ethics clause or content causing a contract or to blow up her humongous sixty nine million dollar deal\nAnd well it looks like they might have found\nWhat they were looking for to get out of this really really expensive deal which hasn't paid off\nSo I don't expect Megan Kelly is going to be back on NBC ran a rerun today reruns scheduled for tomorrow and looks like she's a done and I don't dislike Megan Kelly of I don't\nI don't dislike you're really in all I fight or to be a pretty smart individual it's why I'm surprised\nThat I think she unwittingly and wasn't intentional but again with everyone tried to stab you and come at you especially with her in a situation to NBC high paid and people were offended and she had a target on her back\nOthers to you based on your list to get the news and information you rely on even when you are an arrow radio you can take this station when you're on the go\nDownload the all new radio dot com app on your smartphone\nOr anywhere\nSay two exceeds any expectation early dream I could've ever had about a hospital I was told we wouldn't get a bill or I didn't quite process that houses possible as possible through all the wonderful people who don't ...

phone report which has him if you don't know about this we'll get to an all next\nThese mysterious a essentially cell phone emulate is er replicated is\nThat had been discovered in in orbit around in their mobile they can come and go and disappear I get I don't think we've heard everything I don't know if anything has been intercepted if there have been any confiscation or arrests or you know whether anything been kept secret but the technology is out there\nIn order to intercept\nAnd according to the New York times piece a speaking of Trump he's been ward repeatedly that the Chinese and the Russians are listening\nWhen he is on a cell phone\nWhether it is a personal iPhone or a that he continue using until last year and has held onto primarily because and his phone number is listed in it\nThat he couldn't store in the new one\nOr whether it's the government won all they can do is strip it down as much as possible a government phone those are not secure or you can still listen to him he was warned that this was a problem and that he is often ignored the warnings\nHe has gotten better about using the secure lab lines and using the switchboard phones that is true but this has been a long an arduous process\nAnd\nThat was Maggie Haberman responding uh this morning she was on CNN and that was just her transcript from being on CNN this morning and then of course I read you a Trump's response or that he's calling out and he's calling it's fake news\nI was I don't know what the actual reality is but I don't think it wouldn't surprise me are shocked me the president's still uses a cell phone and we'll have some\nInteresting conversations on the cell phone I I Hope he doesn't do it but you know I I'm guessing maybe he does or has\nUh interesting conversations on the cell phone I I Hope he doesn't do it but you know I I'm guessing maybe he does or has so the New York\nTimes piece says that Trump has been pressured into using the secure White House landline more often but he still has refused to give up his iPhones\nSteve Wynn who owns a resort in Macau is among the friends of Mr Trump the Chinese hope they used to influence the president\nPresident Trump is through official iPhones that have limited abilities that a third that is no different from hundreds of millions iPhones\nIn use around the world or some of the capturing here\nUh when Trump calls all friends on one of his iPhones the gossip gripe or solicit their latest take on how he's doing American intelligence reports indicate the Chinese spies are often listening and putting to use invaluable insights into how to best work the president\nAnd affect the administration policy\nCurrent and former American officials said Mr Trump's aides have repeatedly warned him that his cell phone calls and not secure and they have told him that the Russian Spies are routinely eavesdropping on the calls as well as the Chinese but aides say that the vulnerable president\nWho has been pressured into using a secure White House landline more often these days they'll as we previously mentioned has refused to give up his iPhones\nAnd just hoping that whenever he's armies phones that he refrain from discussing classified information when he is on these phones\nIs the crux use of his iPhones was detailed by several current and former officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity so they could discuss classified intelligence insensitive security arrangements\nThe officials said that they were doing so not to undermine Mr Trump but at a frustration with what they considered the president's casual approach\nTo electronic security\nAmerican spy agencies the official said have learned that the Chinese and the Russians were eavesdropping on the president's cell phone calls from human sources inside foreign governments and intercepting communications between foreign officials\nI mean if this is the case I mean there's a scary stuff I mean this is this is one spies are made them this is what\nYou know espionage and having foreign agents crawling on our soil this is what they're trying to find that wants to try to gather and most of the truth be known we've got spies crawling all over the world is well we've got operatives everywhere and I hope we do\n\nBut the president really really pissed off about this obviously are hence the two tweets from this morning and I I just don't believe that the whole story is fake news I'm sure there is a shred of some truth\nTo the president using the cell phones and again I just hope that if the Chinese or the Russians are listening in that\nHe's talking about is of no value whatsoever you know even if there's no classified information though the claim is is that the Chinese and the Russians can glean and gain some insight\nOn the president's conversations is discussions his demeanor and then maybe as they suggest the way to approach or manipulate or how to deal with the Trump White house [noise] and\nAs they suggest the way to approach or manipulate or how to deal with the Trump White house and of course I I Want to give the Chinese and the Russians nothing I understand the dangers I understand the threats\nIf I were told don't use your cell phone you're the president and you are a massive target for inception trust me I Would not be using the cell phone\nOr we'd he'd and all warnings and I would abide by my intelligence officials automatic like this Chinese or the Russians folks ah their meddling they continue to metal their meddling as we speak they get a mental up to the midterms\n\nAnd I've said for years on this program that I think that we're going to have\nA coming war with China I think it could get ugly I think that at some point we will have a military confrontation I'm not saying it's World War three but I think there can be nasty nasty confrontation and potential war with China\nAnd I've been saying this for for years on this program almost two decades we started the show in two thousand one I talked about this uh as far back as I can remember\nAnd to bolster the point the former commander of the U.S army in Europe says that it's likely the United states will be at war with China\nWithin Fifteen Years retired Lieutenant General Ben Hodges\n\nHe senator Warsaw, Poland security forum yesterday that European allies will have to do more to ensure their own defenses against Russia\nOr\nAs we need to focus more on the Pacific and and the Chinese he said I think in Fifteen Years it's not inevitable but it's a very strong likelihood\nThat we will be at war with China the United states does not have the capacity to do everything that it has to do in Europe and in the Pacific to deal with the Chinese threat\nAnd this was a military times report and again I've bought this for a very long time and I also believe that our military infrastructure or have also believe that this is a big problem and we've got issues\nWith the Chinese are All right well let me prioritize and\nAnd get as much as I can on in the final minutes here on a on a Thursday you're on the net or I don't know if you saw this but the Senate Judiciary chairman who we saw plenty of during the Kavanaugh hearings Chuck Grassley today\nHas referred Julie sweating at one of the late accusers whose story was falling apart and represented by Michael I have a Ninety\nPorno attorney or so the chairman Chuck Grassley of the Senate Judiciary referred Julie sweat make and Michael as an oddity her lawyer to the department of justice\nFor a potential criminal investigation over false statements that they made to Congress\nRegarding Supreme Court justice Brett Kavanaugh\nWell that'd be kinda sweet that'd be somewhat poetic huh if I have an audience sweat Nick if they were found to have delivered false statements what does that mean that means the accusations completely by going her story was just a preposterous on numerous levels\nDelivered false statements what does that mean that means the accusations completely having her story was just preposterous on numerous levels\nThat was sweating like\nWho is never investigated and I you know even you know ... he represented just a a slimy story all the way around\nSo what does Chuck Grassley no what false statements did they make ... body or this woman sweating like\nWell let's see where this investigation goes um [noise] let's see if there were any charges filed I Can't wait to find out exactly", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "25"}
