Trump\nDid with Axios act CEOs is a Web site ... it's a pretty good website\nI started by some veterans that came out of Politico and they've hit the ground running a big names involved they hit the ground rotting and they've grown very fast and it's become a a website that I checked every single day I actually I was\nWith this uh this other project or doing Axios on HBO did an interview with President Trump and that's where a birthright came up and the fourteenth amendment\nAnd listen to the audio that has well made this a huge story today\nOn immigration some legal scholars believe you can get rid of the ... citizenship without changing the constitution executive order exactly\nRight or have you thought about this how many more it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member ...\nYou don't have you done number one number one you don't need that number to the next thing you know very much into well you can definitely do with it an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world where a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits\nI at first of all that's not that's not correct a there are many countries that they do a birthright citizenship in fact I was looking at\nSome stats yeah I think you're right to sue I'm just going to say I think it's around thirty you got a bunch here in the western hemisphere as well that also allowed birthright citizenship so much I I'm I'm a I'm a fact broker over here so that's important to point out\n... ridiculous it's ridiculous and it has to end um have you talked about that with counsel yeah I have to wear in the process in the process it will happen when an executive order that's what you're talking about really as a very interesting thing about I didn't think anybody but knew them for me I thought I was the only one China is a good guess could\nNever find somebody to go and that's just started a huge firestorm today I you know we're in a while I stand on birthright citizenship do I like that\nAnger babies per se I Want to get it for that I Want to stand on what would happen most likely if the Supreme Court and some more details and you're fulfilling a musician and show\nThe latest from McCain eggs and he knew that gives the seconds on a new song eight forty AM hey accent the\nThis is a court ordered notice current and former Ford Lincoln and mercury owners or less the skin receive payments and other benefits from a legal

seven three five five five nine six that's auto airbags settlement dot com or one eight eight eight seven three five five five nine six\nThe premise so where do you ... would you like to see the fourteenth amendment repealed\nWould you like to see a a constitutional challenge to the Supreme Court before that though would you like to see President Trump\nIssue an executive order ending birthright citizenship which again would be immediately a throat up the chain in the in the federal court system\nYou know a federal court of appeal and this and this and then of course it would be a Supreme Court case or if if the White House decided to take that for you know they get always withdraw their executive order\nBut they would lose this let's be very clear the White House\nWould lose this that there's no doubt about an eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine than nationwide number how do you feel about your babies the the effect of the president ought to issue the executive order\nEven knowing that it would probably be shot down by the Supreme Court including\nMany of and maybe even the appointees of Trump on the conservative side of the court\nEight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine the nationwide number here on Schmidt eight hundred eight zero one\nEighty nine Ninety nine is how you get on a yeah I've got some more little bits and pieces I Want to get into but I Want to go to phones are pretty quickly here while we have a time left in the hour let's grab Scott up first today in Las Vegas Nevada Scott Iran Schmidt welcome to the program hello\nEight or nine long time man thank you very much\nSo the ... amendment goes back to\nTrying to solve the problem with the Dred Scott goes into and I read that or talk about the\nJurisdiction an object of the state illegal alien by definition are not subjected to our jurisdiction\nThere or the or does not apply to people that are here illegally if you go back to certain cases that were I think there was a case of a tiny a legal alien that had been here through Ellis Island in here what being deprived of his right he took it and went up to the Supreme Court that\nHe is completely subject right the fourteenth amendment here legally and\nAllowed to stay here and\nIs offering work and that are legal but that doesn't apply to illegal aliens\nAnd Scott I went with that with that case with that case you might be talking about the United states the ... a long Kim aren't if I'm not a tea Eighteen Ninety eight case\nIs that does that sound familiar to you [laughter]\nYeah so Eighteen Ninety eight it was ah the United states the\nUh one Kim\nOrange that was a big case I was reading about that earlier so I'm Glad you brought up by a a credit goes to a ... the article I was reading came from law and crime and they also pointed out a flyer versus do\nFrom Nineteen eighty two and then Nineteen eighty five you had the INS the Rio's Panetta\nSo we do have you know some of these cases ah as far as birthright being upheld and as far as one has already been decided by the Supreme Court if in fact the president Scott decided to go the executive order out there's no doubt in my mind that\nIn court if in fact the president Scott decided to go to the executive order out there's no doubt in my mind that this would be shot down that this would would would not survive a Supreme Court challenge and you know the question is you know the president\nI ... and the president is obviously being counseled or he's had discussions at the White House level and you know White House legal counsel level level and I'm I'm sort of doubting here\nThat that\nTrump's White house legal counsel gave him a green light and didn't give him all of the speed bumps and pitfalls along the way because you\nKnow in the act seals interview and again I played it before the break up all play another chunk a chunk here again because I think it's important for the audience to just joined us here but Trump did say that he ran this by his legal team\nAnd that's where he said that you don't need a constitutional amendment\nThat an executive order would suffice and I just can't believe that his legal team\nA council him and said yeah you're going to win this fight go ahead and issue an executive order and we're going to win this or at the Supreme Court I gotta believe that if this was a discussion among President Trump's legal team that they flat out told him that you were going to lose this\nI asked the Supreme Court level you're going to lose it up the chain of the federal law you know if it goes to a federal appeals court in D.C and then up to the Supreme Court he's going to lose at every step of the way uh even with a so called conservative or appoint these or presidents are that were Republicans that\nAre that are appointed a more conservative judges Scott thanks for the call I appreciate it let me play the audio one more time here again this is from act CEOs on HBO\nTalking about birthright citizenship\nSome legal scholars believe you can get rid of the citizenship without changing the constitution ... executive order exactly right or have you thought about this tell me more it was always told me that you needed a constitutional a member ...\nYou don't you know number one number one you don't need that's number two lessons of human generations well you can definitely do with it an act of Congress but now they're saying I can do it just was an executive order\nNow how ridiculous we're the only country in the world\nWhere a person comes in has a baby and the baby is essentially a citizen of the United states for eighty five years with all of those benefits it's ridiculous it's ridiculous and it has to end um have you talked about\nThat with counsel yeah I have to wearing the person is in the process it will happen with other executive order that's what you're talking about we as a very interesting because I didn't\nKnow the president saying that it's going to have but he says the executive order will happen\nWill it I mean he has to know and he must have been council that if he does issue the executive order it's going to be immediately legal challenges ... legally challenge and it's probably going to lose\nAnd be found unconstitutional ... Supreme Court is the president going to go down that road that\nIs the big question\nI Would I like to see the battle you know it might be someone using but you know also [laughter] it's you know that would be pretty tough mulch ooh is actually eight hundred eight zero one eighty nine Ninety nine but nationwide number\nIran Schmidt let's go back to the phones so what do I do my call screeners all our flipping out what what do you want me to take\nA let's read bill in Port Charlotte Florida bill you're on Schmidt welcome\nLast flipping out ... what do you want me to take a let's read bill in Port Charlotte Florida bill you're on Schmidt welcome\nAre you doing buddy love your show thank you and I agree with\nYou one hundred percent oh hardly about it or lose it and as you ... ... ...\nI think the timing of it is a little ... factory he probably could have said this maneuver for after the midterm credit the people on both sides can agree this isn't gonna stand the test and one thing that there are there had been to the executive\nOrder like free speech zone and other stuff or\nOr things like that that kind of have my eye or when it comes to the constitution but I Believe the heart of the constitution made it pretty difficult to amend it for for these type of particular reasons you\nKnow well you know so ... so the bottom line here is I think that a Trump if he goes down this road\nI think he's less concerned with ah the constitutionality or whether he would win versus I think he's ... up and and throwing just giant chunks of red meat at the base\nThis Halloween you can find treats for everybody at Walgreens like the Harry princesses only likes get cats or the superhero who's allergic to peanuts even the witch who will try to sneak more imminent when nobody's looking to find the traits that are perfect for them all at Walgreens with great prices and easy and easy out it's All right here now through October\nThirty first select Mars regularly and Hershey candy\nBack or buy one get one free shot for your Halloween treats today Walgreens trusted since Nineteen I Want\nThis Halloween you can find treats for everybody at Walgreens like the Harry princesses only likes cats or the superhero was allergic to peanuts even which who will try to sneak more M. and m's when nobody's looking to find the traits that are perfect for them all at Walgreens with great prices and easy an easy out it's All right here now through October\nThirty first select Mars regularly and Hershey candy\nBacks or buy one get one free shot for your Halloween treats today ... trusted since Nineteen ...
