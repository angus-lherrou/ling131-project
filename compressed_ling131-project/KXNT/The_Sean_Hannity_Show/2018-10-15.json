use this this bustamante guy\nVacation then would Trump be within his right to say okay so you use this uh this bustamante guy certainly he's got a very impressive resume and and see me but if you don't mind we'd like to do two additional DNA tests\nAnd see how they come back to it's like a second and third opinion if a million bucks is on the line\nDo you think that there ought to be a a ... a control or should they be on at least verification from a different uh testing source\nI don't think there's anything wrong with going out and get him verification if she thinks she's Indian or he's going to stand by it and what did she care how many tests are going to be done and then I was going to come out that she's a smart Gen that's all she needs has that how he worried now that\nYou know I mean yeah try to get anything affirmative action all that she doesn't qualify for any of that that is ridiculous she's probably as much American indian as I Am which is miniscule which is pretty much not a\nBut if it weren't and said if you can prove she did if he if he lost that call she should have no problem going and get ... recap that again 'cause it should come out and say she's still a

know granted I'm not ... merging\nThe quality of the work or the integrity of bustamante but I think when you're dealing with some things are this high profile as there ought to be ah some verification and backups as I suggested and he seemed to agree thanks for the call Rebecca I appreciate it also remember\nThat the Republican National committee spokesman Mike Reed said today\nThat Warren Elizabeth Warren might be even less Native American than the average European American that that the average European Americans probably have more Native American then one she's claiming\nBack to the phones let's grab a lot of Las Vegas calls a brain he is in Las Vegas Nevada Brady you're on Smith Hi\nOh [laughter]\nOh [laughter] oh [laughter] I was going to say I'm\nA I don't think from what happened here I think ... about five or six separate ancestry DNA that have most committed and\nEverybody can look at 'em underneath analysis and then combine all the revolt together but it's only one percent or less probably less than even that uh any European ancestry will qualify you one present an Indian\nAutomatically so like your previous caller you're going to have some type of Indian but almost all people got to have more than one percent qualify as an Indian\nRight listen at ... at one thirty second and again this this is the best they can be the best if it's between six and ten generation and of course it works exponentially here if she is one thirty second which would be a six generations back\nThat would put her in three point one to five percent if my math\nIs correct and then if she is at a one and a one a one and a one thousand twenty four percent let me see if we try and do the math on that real quick so one slash one old too for\nA as a percentage that would put her aunt uh let's see here [laughter] ... ah that would put her at a point zero nine seven percent yeah\nAh that would put her at a point zero nine seven percent\nQuote\nYeah not I mean not I mean like I said a bowling ball I think as a higher uh amount of a Native American blood\nOne question I have a yard was if you go back you're taking you know\nWhy the the uh people that are doing it now if they didn't know that Haley don't man and you know what you're talking before Indian and wine bar and the street going back to them\nAnd just the Indian why don't the Indian ... but then as all automatically we're going back to the needed in your area man with your dog your before well\nI guess it really comes down to the claims of the different nations and their land claims and\nThe fact that they had settled that land or it was it was it was part of their tribal grounds land unless I understand the claim and uh yeah I mean listen uh we we certainly mode over a lot of Native American lands and I I don't feel great about the a lot of what occurred over the years you know going back\nYou know a couple of centuries or even just yeah I mean there's a century plus uh you know Eighteen hundreds I don't feel great about that Brady thanks for the call let's stay in Las Vegas or let's go to pat in Vegas pat you're on ... go ahead\n... uh hello good to talk to you or I don't think he should pay it at all I I when I heard him\nSay that I assumed that he would uh at meant that he or she had to be more than [laughter] than nothing [laughter]\nWell I again and I should it be that would ever tried she claims that she has to meet that threshold yet again it's yeah it's a little it's a little confusing and I pointed this out last a half\nHour and if you're listening\nTo you yeah yeah yeah you should have at least that you know if if you have the\nAnd thanks for the call pat and turn on the radio I'm going to go over this again so the tribal blood quantum requirements again there are fifty percent requirements twenty five percent requirements if she is parts\nAnd she claimed but she's part of a one of the Delaware tribes if she's Delaware Nation Oklahoma\nShe has to be twelve point five percent or one the eighth to qualify so she's not even close however if she is part of\nThe Delaware tribe of Indians so there are two different and that requires looming oldest sent Cherokee Nation also requires Lenny all\nBut then there's an eastern band Cherokee Indians\nAh North Carolina and they require six point two five percent or one's sixteen so again I just wanted to clarify and give you all the possibilities according to the power dot com website and I'm not making that up that Israel it really is about well a Native American insults\nWebsite a boy back to the phones a Port Charlotte Florida Scott as Nextel us got interested in how you doing sir all as well so should Trump have to call up a million dollars\nAbsolutely not and here's why to the federal government uh for for for purposes of joining the military as an enlisted personnel are going to the Naval Academy if you want to declare any kind of minority status African American Asian Hispanic or American Native American you can go back three generations and then sold your great grandparents\nWas a minority I'm you would have to provide groove a birth certificate and then you could declare yourself as that minority but it's only three generations and that's federal all those in the themes that you know he's a federal people were talking about um if the federal\nIs that minority but it's only three generations and that's federal all do since the seems that you know these are federal people were talking about um if the federal government recognizes three generations that I think that should be much more\n... to put this in prices right sound effects terms should Trump pay Elizabeth Warren the million dollars it would be\n[noise]\nYou got it [laughter] you get your lap and so you you understand the prices right sound effects right of course of course [laughter]\nThen we'll have more pricing games coming up [laughter] or\nBack the phones thanks for the call Scott I appreciate it let's go to Aspen, Colorado hello will you're on the net in Aspen\nHello ... well in Aspen I guess\nI can get by you had a couple of gas barely are arguing the mandates and I would argue
