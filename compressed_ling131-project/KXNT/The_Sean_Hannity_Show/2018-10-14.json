of the New England historic any logical society and American ancestors dot org\nWell it's going really well in in town for anybody who's a member of Red Sox nation I'll tell you that that was quite a beating the Yankees got in on fire boys from me\nSure and that's really important stuff and it's time consuming too and especially if you don't know what you're doing so where would somebody start would you say when it comes to getting their matches they just got them in through ancestry DNA you're\nLooking to the things I Would imagine you'd want to start with people you know and say oh look at that their friend and yeah that's my cousin and you kinda get that sense of the land the land right and the idea that oh look at that's accurate you know there is second does in right in that range\nRight exactly if you do see some people that you know you know close relatives area than a little more distant that's ideal if you've got somebody that you know how you're related to them\nThen you can start to figure out who else do you share DNA with that they also share DNA with and those people probably descend from the same\nCommon ancestor or sell it becomes kind of a filtering process tell target testing some of your relatives can help with that if you really at a loss get while you're 'cause it's a test and that will help kinda sorted out for you\nI mean I don't think there's any more important button on the ancestry side then that shared match button right\nI agree yeah absolutely that's the key thing that I use all the time in my work trying to find people's families and understanding of\nThis is of paramount importance\nWhich really complicated sometimes though when you start going from okay well I I've got a match to this one I Do not recognize you go to the matches the matches and sometimes you can start to break it open that way you have that experience\nI have that something that you need to be a little bit careful with you don't want to take too many hops and assume that the person is still related to the first person that you started with especially if you've got colonial us ancestry with\nRod imagine and that sort of thing but I I Do that all the time with my own matches if I find somebody that I\nDon't recognize idol American the notes field matches known you know Smith Jones defendant or you know whatever line and they are\nAnd then I'll look at the shared matches with that person and I will say match to matches of something I typically don't go any farther than my own research but eventually that information can be really helpful because\nYou know especially when you're working with more distant matches not everybody's going to match everybody else but that doesn't mean they're not related if that makes sense\nThat makes a lot of sense you know there there are a lot of little tools on ancestry as they are under utilized but I think are really helpful and you just mentioned one of a little note area we're matches and people are worried that some of these people will see that but of course you can see that it's just for your own personal notes on your own account\nRight and you could mark all kinds of stuff there which means you don't have to put into that to see how they're related just click on the ... you'll see the whole thing you can put in there so many center Morgan's you share who you think this person might be related through what the dominance is you might be what the relationship is so often put in you know three seed\nTo our for third cousin twice removed or something like that and by keeping track of that it just makes it a whole lot easier than going through now now where did we find that person again\nBecause you think you're going to remember all of these things you know it goes by like that I like it this far so yeah I had\nA that record keeping step is fairly important with my own match if if I Know the relationship with her cousin or whatever I'll put that in a put the number of Senate organs that we share it so I don't have to look that up again common ancestors and I know it and then I Will put in\nMy matches entire ancestral line from the common ancestor set themselves and those are nice things to not have to keep\nSnow back up again and again the right absolutely\nOne thing I just wanted to add on you talked about not having to click into the match and being able to look at the notes\nFrom the main page and there is a extension for the chrome browser called met better DNA that makes it even easier that you don't even have to click on the little notes icon it you can can figure that to display all your notes on the page when you look at them a match paid sweet\nYeah it's awesome and then that makes it a little easier to do some searching and I like to do that especially with my first page of matches I'm always\nKind of looking at that his new what's different who don't I Know who they are those are the ones that really kind of get under my skin if it's somebody that's in my first said the matches that I don't know who they are when I can see all the notes than I can see who I don't know and those are the ones that I kind of tend to focus on a little more\nI'm Talking to Richard Jordans and she's a DNA specialist with legacy tree genealogy and the rich and how far back do typically like to research your managers\nWell it kind of depends on how closely related they are to me or to the person that I'm researching so you know if they share sixty Seventy send him Oregon's they're probably a third cousin is how I Want to go back at least have a great great grandparents and sometimes you can go now to\nConnection becomes clear that off and you have to go at least that far or maybe even a generation back I don't research everybody that I encountered at fourth or fifth grandparents because there aren't enough hours\nIn the name of that [laughter] yeah right but it's a fine line between not spending too much time on everybody but going far enough so that you're not missing something on a key person\nYou know I'm just thinking you know when you go to break open brick walls which I think is really the primary purpose of finding these matches other than confirming maybe what you think you already know\nWhen you get back to the boy it really gets complicated in so many of them to try to sort through in moms and dads side which line and sometimes they're tied to multiple lines because you're from the same area it gets really tricky\nBut if you can find the fourth 'cause we break open your brick walls to the third grade level that's that's pretty exciting stuff right\nIt is and yeah I I think I miss him terribly at your previous question but yeah the fifth have cousins I look at some of them I don't look at most of them and I hear people comment on their total number of matches including all of the distance matches you know oh I have twenty thousand\nMatches I can look at the mall well of course you're not going to and that shouldn't be a goal I'm semi we'll\nFocus on some that are in the fifth to aids if they come up on a surname search and then I'll explore that a little more and you know hopefully they might have some shared matches with some other people who are in my first cousin or closer list and then that kind of get my attention and right\nAnd it's important for people to know by the way if you're trying to match people who were first to force cousins they will show you the matches you have in the presence\nRight you go to the east coast and click on matches will show you any closer relatives you have to force cousins\nThat is true and that is a point that frustration for many ancestry there's although I have to say now three years into this I really have come to see the wisdom of that decision on ancestry part\nI think a Fifteen sending Morgan cut off would be nice as an ad on but the processing power involved with that I don't think it's going to happen but I think it's better not to have your shared matches list muddied with you know seven eight Senate Morgan matches I think that ultimately creates more confusion than clarity\nYeah that's true you makes you do when you're really trying to work on something a little bit further back yes nice to have the option although I'm thinking the options they're minutes we're going to be all in or not right\nRight right yeah in a former lifetime I wrote software for a living and so I've thought a lot about the implications of that sort of him\nSo I don't know that um what kind of improvements would you like to see on ancestry I'm adding more colors to their stars yes would be huge and that and ours\nRight that to me is surprising that it hasn't been implemented yet because it seems like it wouldn't be that difficult to change it I think it would be a real crowd\nPleaser for their customers so that's one and I'd really like to see more search capabilities you know we've got the surname search and you can search location would you can't do both\nYou can't do both and the ability to put in a first name you know when you're searching other people's trees especially if you have a really common surname that you're looking at one of my husband's ancestor lines is faith and Mike in search Bates from Virginia but it's just overwhelming and\nMost of them actually end up matching some of their line completely ...\nI get a first name and then that would be incredibly helpful\nWell some great ideas and a great advice stretching Jorgensen from legacy tree genealogist thanks so much for coming on the show\nOh hey I Believe it or not\nRoots jak is closing in on us again we're going to find out the latest on what you expect for twenty Nineteen edition for ... birds and coming up next\n\n[noise]\nThe all new

amendment and aging San jose I'm surprised that more people did not get hurt though during when you start looking at the eye of that storm and where it hit how close it hit it could have had to like a major metropolitan area\nAnd it wasn't just twenty miles or twenty miles per hour from being a category five storm I mean this would be huge hurricane\nYeah my brother lives near Panama City\nAnd how is he he's doing great okay or his house survived good but we're all\nYou know thinking I kept telling him like you know you you should go evacuate I think you should leave and you tell them to evacuate only two days beforehand and he did them morning of the hurricane yeah Russian government aren't we yes um\nBut you know he lives right on the water on and he built a house that's like twelve or you know like twelve feet above the ground and he said the water was four feet up\nOkay so so ... was a smart choices but you know it's so funny that you know think about that so so if your house is twelve feet off the ground right\nEvery time that you pull into your driveway you're getting your steps and\nYou're trying to make sure you're wearing your predominant [laughter] because you're

okay you know what you guys are doing good and it takes a while you know make sure that everything's all back in action and uh but certainly our our hearts and our first goes to everybody that has been affected by that hurricane especially as it continues just to keep moving on\nCoast um so I understand you have a question about the smart a speakers once you get the power and once you get your Internet back\nRight yeah yeah I mean I just heard a lot about you know everybody getting them the thing that everyone should have and I'm like do I really need one and what would I use it or\nYou know it's a really good question because it's one of these gadgets that initially when you get it you go wow that's really cool I mean so you can say you know tell me what the weather is tell me what the traffic is going to look like order\nA more toilet paper paper towels or whatever it may be and then you start moving up the actual long so then you say turn on the light\nAnd you can also say goodnight and when you say goodnight is that the alarm system will set the front door will walk the lights will go into night mode and then suddenly on the smart speaker next year end table some white noise is playing to sue the you to sleep\nIs all that happen automatically know of course not you know that [laughter] you [laughter] if they like you to think\nThat but you have to you have to buy all the gadgets along the way I ... you gotta buy the lights the smart lights and the smart locks and then you have to program those but it's not very difficult to program it\nUh there are a thermostats that like the ego be in the nest that work with the Amazon Echo so that\nThis way if you're sitting on the couch and you don't want to get you lazy but up and you can say you know turn the air down to Seventy six or turn the heat up the sixty six or whatever it may be and so it takes a while for you to get indoctrinated into it so to speak\nOr no pun intended with these smart speakers but once you once you get it I think that you'll understand like this is exactly how it's supposed to work or I'm going to put together some links for you over a\nCommando dot com and so that this way you can select to the right Amazon Echo and also we have a couple of articles about some gadgets like I just mentioned that you might want to tie into the Alexa environment and\nOther things for the

Internet connection speed that you're paying for it right\nBecause maybe for example is starting to slow down and you're thinking is my route or is it my modem you know of course one of the things that you want to do is power off the router and modem and then when you start wanting to power back up\nAnd leave it off for a couple of minutes and then POWER UP the modem first and then the router but you also want to make sure that you are getting the speed and so what happens is you're gonna send out of paying\nA painting is how fast will respond to get back from a testing server and as far as download and they'll close feeds they're given in bits per second higher numbers are better okay and download speeds there's typically going to be much much faster than uploads fees\nAnd you want to compare these numbers that you get again speeds at your Internet service provider promises you and you want to run multiple tests over several days do it in the morning do it at night so some sites you want to check out first of all there's ... speed test\nThere's fast dot com which by the way a lot of people don't realize that's actually owned by Netflix\nThere's feet of me and they're also other tests that you can try for example you can just search for speed test on Google and the first hit will show Google's very own speed test tool and you always want to make sure you use a wire connection for more accurate results because why fight\nWork and not necessarily the speed as I mentioned do multiple tests or check your hardware first one to talk about dogs is two and three point O. modems\nAnd then whenever you have newer hardware and you're still seeing lower speeds\nYou want to check for anybody that might be stealing your Internet connection or a type of former upgrades

about is that if I put in a picture up on the Internet and I pull it down is that I can open up the hidden data\nAnd then pretty much see where that photo was taken what type of camera et cetera or just on Google Map and so we want to make sure want to take all that stuff out a couple of thoughts you might want to consider I mean you've you have Google you have the school photos number one\nOr you put them up there there's Yahoo Photos but one of the things that that came to mind when I was listening to your call is that if you go to say for example a photo sharing site like shutter fly okay\nShuttered fly will allow you to create not just photo albums but a particular website if you will that contains all the photos\nAnd so if they had and you'd have to figure out the best way to get the grandparents the the Web address but if they had the Web address\nThey could just keep going back there to refresh it or say once a week or once a month and so they can start seeing and then in addition to that you get a record of them going to see it as well [noise] okay\nUh so just said orders shutter fly and then sign up for an account and again you're going to be some options when you do this that you really looking for your own unique website and then once you do that whoever knows that address that there'll be able to access\nAll those photos and again aside from just the medical data is make sure that there is no identical characteristics with the kids as far as any type of school logos\nOr anything else that might show where they're actually physically located at any of those shots are of course you can always use any photo editing program that just kind of race that stuff in the back and [noise]\nAll right let's talk about one of our great sponsors and there are
