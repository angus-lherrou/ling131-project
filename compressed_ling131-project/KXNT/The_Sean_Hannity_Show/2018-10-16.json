referred to as Elizabeth Warren is getting slammed she took a bogus DNA test and it showed that she may be one one thousand ...\nFar less than the average American now Cherokee Nation denies her DNA test is useless even they don't want her phony exclamation point\nUh now that her claims of being of Indian heritage of turned out to be a scam an ally Elizabeth Warren should apologize for perpetuating this fraud against the American people\nI'm Sorry perpetrate I said perpetuating perpetrating this fraud against the American people Harvard calls or a person of color amazing calm\nAnd would not have taken her of their wives or then of course we have the Cherokee Nation statement which we brought you on yesterday's program a Cherokee Nation secretary said truck Hoskins junior issue the following statement Monday in response to Senator Elizabeth Warren's DNA tests climbing native heritage\nA quote a DNA test as useless to determine tribal citizenship current DNA tests do not even distinguish whether a person's ancestors were indigenous to North or South America\nSo unless we went over also the crime has to recognize you\nAnd she's not recognized by of crime [noise] [noise] oh and then one of the things that will grab some\nCalls and I also have the uh the racial stories that I was talking about at the top of the show we'll get into that in the latter half of this half hour or so hang on but a new item from the Boston Globe and the Boston Globe headline from today is is Elizabeth Warren's genetic test conclusive\nAnd it goes through just the little set up here the misconception here is that any single test provides a definitive answer and that's not accurate at all said Rick WMA Smith an anthropological geneticist at Dartmouth who researches a genetics and\nTribal sovereignty several experts who said that Carlos the bustamante there were non stand for geneticists whom war and hired to test the DNA and produced a solid results showing the CI whereas Native American ancestry ... ten generations Warner's never claim membership at a particular tribe however\nThere is a misconception here that this is absolutely definitive\nAnd if not it is not definitive at all so all kinds of holes are being shot into this story and again it has backfired it is absolutely backfired I don't know who made the final decision who thought this was a good idea\nAnd then in her little video piece to hide the fact that it's a between six and ... as a six and ten generations back or just stupid bad strategy absolute swing and miss a I mean worse than that\nLet's rabbit Yolanda up first today are Schmidt in California you'll learn the you're on ... go ahead\nI oh yeah I Love the fact\nThat we thought there and I know some people say oh he's setting up here it's just ... you can say that you know what we're it because the American people are sick and tired of the news being reported out there by CNN and MSNBC and sometimes even walk for that\nMatter but Trump is a new one out there and weeding out there and you speak my language and that I voted for from from the very get go because\nYou weren't speaking my thinking are a lot of people out there and so you know out there you know when you did this thing with a a a little bit worn out with her and you know how to play the game and so now look what happened or backfired on her\nWas it prompts the question is did Trump forced the backfire by you know the whole Pocahontas moniker\nAnd you know Trump mocking her claims\nAnd then essentially did from force her to make this era I mean folks this is an an forced air Elizabeth Warren made an error and you know I think there's an argument to be made\nThat Trump toyed with her so much for sort of make the stupid Asian with this non definitive information but you learn that was a you know Trump is a whole different kind of president a whole different type of communicator a bunch of times I think that is decorum could be better or a little more presidential\nWell I I Love what he's doing I I think a lot of American doing well\nIt's split you know it's if it's you know half of America and you know it doesn't like what he's doing but listen I again policy wise I I'm I'm right in line with him and I think he's doing a fantastic job on many fronts popped up on on certain levels I Wish that he would\nYou know on some of the whole thing I you know I I'm not calling a Stormy Daniels horse face today\nYou know why they did it could be legally assertive but I don't know if if calling a horse face a helps [laughter]\nI mean I got a chuckle out of it but still you know presidents do that that's a that's a question that we can criticism Idaho Chris you're next on Schmidt high\nA tie that thanks for taking my call I was actually came across her show I thought it was called the shirt show at first and I I got excited because I Do love shirts but ah yeah I'm excited to speak with you\nIt is it's my last name it's the Smith show\nYeah yeah I thought it was shirt initially but um yeah this whole thing with Elizabeth Warren I Am one of the big time the all time backfires I mean and I'm I got a question for you do you think you think this is a bigger backfire or do you think it's as big of a or a bigger backfire\nA\nThank you uh let's grab a paint in riverside California Pete you're on Schmidt high\nYeah hey look at the numbers three and a half a generation for a hundred years she's Nineteen fifty she was born at least Eighteen fifty\nThen you go back to Seventeen fifty to get the seven and then you go back to about sixteen Ninety to get the tent her great great great grandmother is Eighteen fifty so she's off by a hundred and fifty years\nWell I did I see something was it was the Seventeen hundreds or seven teams since you know I I don't know yet hundreds yeah yeah exactly yeah about some ... right yeah 'cause I didn't read that it would put it in the Seventeen hundreds I saw that yesterday\nEarly Seventeen hundreds for sure yeah well yeah I've been close great grandma's it at that one that she said was Eighteen fifty\nRight so well that that would put it back at that that that temps generation standpoint I don't even think that they have they have no they were grasping for flaws and if there was even just one thread found if it was just a little needle found that a gigantic haystack they were going to run with it and\nThat's the mistake they made it's just it's a it's just stupid stupid calculation ... absolutely backfired\n... one more point you know the uh the abuse by political white people of Indians that ends with Lauren okay he ends with Warren but there's this abusive Indians you know politically\nFirst of all the um you know the the Native Americans are not happy with this you saw that in the neck you saw the Cherokee Nation statement and in fact I knew my front cranked up the radio and I want you to listen to this thanks for the call I appreciate it\nI have some audio here and I got I got a dig this up and I if I I think I haven't chewed up yeah I Do like this is Oklahoma Republican U.S representative mark Wayne Mullen and he is a member of the Cherokee Nation\nAnd he was on Fox and friends this morning and listen to this\nBut it is extremely disappointed when she's out there claiming that she's Native American just because she's from Oklahoma and look there was a twenty fourteen study scientific study and they said that average European American walking around its point one eight percent Native American she's half\nThat so the idea that she continues to double down on this why is the most disgusting thing to me is the fact that she's in the public eye and she continues to use is and what she was trying to do was put this to bed so she could run against President Trump and twenty twenty and it isn't backfiring on her and I I'm Glad to see it because she was she needs to do is come out and apologize to all of\nA slow so there's a U.S Republican congressman member of the Cherokee Nation ally backfired apologized to us all\nHey Elizabeth Warren is that what you had in mind I don't think so a race in America couple of

get back\nI Want to talk about the additional new complications here\nAlso we have the the Trump complication also the president has a new statements so we have new audio from President Trump regarding the prince and the king if they knew about this plant\nMurder all the Jamal cause Yogi what folks just to grasp an wrap your brain around the gruesome this a one apparently happened\nIs looking more and more like he was killed in the embassy that appears to be or what happened and then dismembered with a bowl and saw what about waiting for it\nAnd they take it apart and carry back in pieces to Saudi Arabia are one of those private jet flights in diplomatic bags you know the diplomatic bags that are are not allowed to be searched [noise] hold on we'll get\nBack into this match the

have\nThe ability to do whatever the hell you want without checks and balances and that's what they did here obviously but they've gotten caught which is a big problem so Jamal could show he walks into the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey\nAnd that was about two weeks ago it was October second if I'm not mistaken and he hasn't been seen or heard of sense\nWhy do you go to the embassy well he went into the embassy because he's getting married to his new fiance\nBut apparently he needed new paperwork and documentation he needed Saudi Government approval to divorce the other wife so we can get married to his new girlfriend or fiance a Turkish woman\n[noise] late last week we have the details that the Turkish government said that it had an audio and video proving that ... who was a former royal insider of sorts in Saudi Arabia and he turned into a dissident\nAi and they hated him he became so it became a mission to try to shut this guy up so much so that they really struck this guy up\nTo the point where he's hiding pieces somewhere where where's the body where the body parts I should say we're the arms where's the line was the head\nWhat about the torso did they take that out in time or they have a cut that off into\nAs well and the folks if it's gross a organs gross you out well that's probably what happened here unbelievable so the Turkish government late last week we told you about this last month\nThat they apparently claimed to have audio and video of the show Gabe being tortured interrogated a and then murdered Fifteen Saudis including a forensic doctor or with a bone saw\nAccording to multiple sources went to the conflict the Daily Show he was there they knew he was coming\nBecause he had to get the paperwork so in the paper was prepared they knew he was coming and they dispatched to I mean the way this thing is is unfolding with on falling is if they they made the appointment and essentially it was not an appointment for his paperwork for his divorce and then re marriage know\nSexually\nHe was getting his paypal war for his death warrant I mean that's what this really actually was\n[noise] Fifteen Saudis two different private planes I mean this is like something out of a movie a hit squad you need Fifteen guys well\nAgain this is a little gross some why Fifteen guys well they needed maybe multiple people to carry those diplomatic pouches out of the country I yeah I was I'm an expert on on diplomatic pouches I mean how many are allowed to carry hey so you know that's a good question\nWell a diplomatic pouches I think very in size but there'll be favorite suit could you find me a [laughter] find me a primer on diplomatic pouches everything you wanted to know about diplomatic pouches which again when you have governments\nThey come into the United states to visit their embassies from foreign governments and even governments that are friendly\n\nThey can bring stuff invite these diplomatic pouches that were not allowed to search yeah lots of radiation or\nBiological detector goes off [noise] but I'd love to know so if you don't mind a a diplomatic pouches can they vary in size is there a limitation how many diplomatic pouches can one diplomat carry\nCut a diplomat or take a flight is central you have you know all of a pallet full of diplomatic houses or do you need multiple people 'cause I was thinking Fifteen guys maybe they needed each day you know carry a you know an arm and a leg you\nAre the head or maybe a foot to feed you have two hands alright right hold on so many parents aren't turning a microphone on late isn't on hold on as\nSoon as going to find better info she says oh she initially a bark than my ear that they can be any size\nOkay do you like roller guy up in a carpet and ... like a magic carpet I Choose going to get me some information will bring it to the justice minister and but I back to the story so President Trump\nTalked the king Solomon\nBriefly over the past weekend I was told if the royal family had nothing to do with anything nefarious and suggested that maybe this show he was murdered by Roald killers that's how our president but now some on the king\nHe put our president he put Trump in a very very difficult position and Trump ought to be pissed off at the Saudi royal family and the king\nOver this tough position that he put our president\nHe point the president of the United states of America in a position to potentially help spread or or foment his lives all we had nothing to do that essentially to give the Saudis credibility\nIm them credibility after President Trump floated the whole roll killers I'm doing air quotes by the way after that Syria was floated\nDemocratic Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut who has access to us intel reports said that he had already heard the Saudis plan to shift blame to roll with killers\nAnd he was afraid solemn on the king was using President Trump was are there also the if the raise an eyebrow be suspicious of the Democrat appointing this out a yes certainly however the outrage here is bipartisan and it should\nBe if they kill this guy it shouldn't be Democrats outraged Republicans not no no no no no everyone ought to be pissed beyond belief and Trump ought to be really super angry because was used by the Saudis to help but can ... their story\nYou know there was also the item last week that we are the answers steps that we can intercept that they were planning on interrogating could show so it's all adding up anyway within hours\nOf Trump telling reporters that saw him on denied involvement or CNN then you have the wall Street Journal that it was NBC News they reported that the sources were telling them that the Saudi Government is preparing to admit that the show he was killed at the consulate but are they going to go on this road story\nYou know as I pointed out yesterday\nI oh yeah we just we want to ask them a few questions and ah one of our guys ah you know Mohammed been something or other well he got a little out of hand rolled ... so they're going to suggest that among the Fifteen hit squad members they sent over\nThat somebody went rogue in the group and they were just going to have a harsh talk with him about this role guy\nHe got outta hand chopped off some fingers then an arm than his head whatever\nIt seems to go down that path and as I suggested on yesterday's program and they're going to make some of the fall guy and you know a publicly arrest this individual and\nPut him to death for the uh 'cause what they've done to try to cover the ashes of the crown prince Mohammed\nBin a solemn on and the king that they'll do anything to cover their butts is what it comes down to\n[noise] now it's taken a while\nThe Saudis are trying to get their story straight here which again it's all over the road but this is like a like a drunk driver with a of a point to six they're all over the road on this thing\nI Can't give it a story straight and yeah they're trying to give the king and the crown prince or a good friend of Jared Kushner\nThey're trying to establish some plausible deniability here\nA little bit of separation began uh this this rogue operative that that's where they're headed on this that and the king and prints it no of course they do give me a break of course that nothing happens nobody sneezes without them knowing\nWhat ought to terrify everyone is they thought they can get away with this you know we've got a lot of it's going between Vladimir ...\nYeah there are stories of all of them the poop ... uh enemies whoever putting doesn't like that and they ended up dead in jail they disappear I saw a story last week or last week\nOr they can dig it up here somewhere or three a well known\nBusinessmen a complete\nOur adversaries uproot and both at arms are all three that up there ... it was a coincidence yeah sure [noise]\nAnyway the interrogation gone bad total lie total cover story no one's buying it you know could show he just went in to to get the official Saudi approval for the divorce and then the ability to marry his fiance\nG D G E R B L indefinitely it'd be there

trash and people who didn't like we'd have their back to the Billy goat named Joe will Joe to come up in\nBag you from a higher I mean [laughter] and uh but well he's often one day right\nOff men didn't often didn't lose the breath you went up strangled the thing put it in a show called killed it right then and there\nWas an inside when in fact grabbed a knife again quarter in it later\nGrounded up and served it later that night as heroes at a party\nWhoa where where what what college was this\nThis is going to nominate Wisconsin as a stout was in college and White House is about\nNinety four and there was a a a bay right up in the paper ah\nReading some other people from both Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for not following the Iran Iraq\nOh jeez well how how how was how was the goal was to go pretty good\nI didn't I didn't ... but happy at all about the ... yeah I hear you I I have\nHad curry go before and I actually like go go does actually I find it very tasty until you know a very big in Caribbean Islands and Caribbean culture a goat is pretty big hey Gerber thanks for the call and I I Love the early snow up in vale but again last year there was early snow and we know um\nWhat the what the holiday season was like last year so um my fingers crossed\nAnd everybody [noise]\nEver going to see up in the back both see a blue sky let's grab a Linda in temple Linda you're on Schmidt high\nHigh an afternoon\n[noise] I don't think that that where it's racist appropriate\nI I voted for Trump and I think and now it's a ... ... and mean and the atmosphere in the United states it because of the language to use it people can think they can say what they want they want he is the parents but it's an becoming an Irish\nI voted for him and I shake my head\nThat wasn't I voted for frankly\nShake my head because this is not how the president should conduct themselves\nDon't listen and I essentially upset as much I voted for Trump is well I support virtually all of his policies but I'll tell you when I disagree and I I just can't put a a Schmidt seal of approval and a gold star\nOn calling the porn star horse face it just it's been nice him it's beneath the presidency and there's got to be dependent on the horns\nAnd care if it's a neat because he's he acts like when you said I'm president and you're not so he thinks he's next that God\nOh it was a good thing\nYou're talking about the the sixty minutes interview that really didn't bother me that's that's more Trump being that that statement didn't bother me fail\nOut on the um I'm I'm not\nDisagreeing with that tiny he's embolden he's empowered I he's not the most powerful position on the planet\nAnd that's why I wouldn't abuse it I I I just don't think that we're agreeing with a horse phase should not have been used but uh you know again policy wise doing a great job but he can use some miss manners touch up worth Linda thanks for the call let's go to a South Carolina\nAnd a green one let's grab Dale Dale horse face where are you are on at\nThe ... the other side of the uh I prefer not cause I prefer not with her at all yeah um but he was I don't think he is the term or space in Trump ism as horses policy which means thirty car 'cause I think\nIt might be misunderstanding or what [laughter]\nThey don't [laughter] thank you detail I appreciate you know a ... before I go back to the phones ... we're\nJust a bizarre place where a very strange it's it's almost a we have a parallel universe is this is this all part of the game is all part of the experiment are we being toyed with is this really just a\nA a game that's being played by [laughter] a force much greater than us [noise]\nUh [noise] you know when I talked about how strange everything is you know the use of force face today and again I got\nThe phone calls were were folks are like yeah they're okay with it I said we've got some more calls on hold I get to those here just a second\nBut the point is folks horse face is non okay\nEven though President Trump is having a you know head bonding with Stormy Daniels porn star lawyer my uh ... and its tit for tat going back and forth here they're nasty words being audible side\nI get that but as the president of the United states\nI don't think he should be calling a U.S citizen who he is having a legal entanglement with who clearly he had a a ... of course the the the Michael Cohen payment the hundred and ... that that ... that was less\nAnd they have a ... a involvement here I I I'm not condoning the have you here and again that just adds to the uh the ... Chu is Ogden is of a watch just seems remarkably surreal\nThe point is though is I don't think that horse faces except unless and Trump has done a lot of things I don't find acceptable but you know a lot of things I Do find acceptable\nAnd that's the difference between me and some other talk show host this I'll tell you when it is unacceptable but we're in a world now where I'll say that horse faces unacceptable the president sugar cold Stormy Daniels that in a tweet this morning at ... am eastern time and I'll get phone calls all get hammered\nOn Twitter I'll get email sniffed what what's wrong with you\nHow dare you not support the president I mean what is going on with the core of what is going on with the mob mentality what is going on with\nA belief that everything Trump does is the best and it's the greatest and it is one hundred percent okay what is that\nTrump can do a great job as president he can be great with the economy he can be great with foreign policy items he can be great with renegotiating economic trade issues like with NAFTA for instance but it doesn't mean that everything he says that every action is appropriate and I don't but I'll be attacked\nFrom folks that are trying to say ... you're you're a liberal now because I don't because I don't give ... I don't give thumbs up by the seal of approval to President Trump that calling this woman horse faces okay\nI mean that's that's the reality of where we're sitting right now and it is it is flipping bizarre let's grab Omar Omar is next in Tampa in Florida I should go ahead oh I'm All right\n[laughter] and it was going off at ... ... nobody shoots himself in the foot\nQuite like Trump\nDied when he had a\nEasy when an easy tweet\nAnd nothing he ... nobody should be talking to like him man\nWell wasn't he go to just send for instance federal judge throws out Stormy Daniels lawsuit versus Trump Trump is entitled to full legal fees and he could've said the great American court system\nHas actually that was an easy win it wouldn't have to rely on when it's all a on him and\nYeah and then um he's watching and the problem is is that he's watching Fox News I don't know if you've ever watched used for like a few hours out kicked off you are when you get off and you're telling me he's not walking into meetings ticked off when he ... he should be focused on our economy", "year": "2018", "show_name": "The Sean Hannity Show", "city": "North Las Vegas", "day": "16"}
